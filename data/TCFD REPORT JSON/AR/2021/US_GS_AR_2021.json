It was challenging for everyone - our clients, our people, our communities. But even in an incredibly dynamic market environment, our people came together, we stayed true to our strategy, we put our clients /first and though we still have a lot of work to do, I'm proud of the fact that we delivered exceptional results to our shareholders.\n\nNet revenues were $59.34 billion, net earnings were $21.64 billion and diluted earnings per common share was $59.45 - all records. Return on average common shareholders' equity (ROE) was 23.0 percent, the highest since 2007, and return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (ROTE) 1 was 24.3 percent.\n\nIt's true the surge in capital markets activity was a big tailwind. The economy continued to recover from the short but severe recession that marked the pandemic's early days, and the robust growth that followed put enormous pressure on supply chains, leading to levels of inflation not seen in decades. By year end, rate hikes were widely expected and markets entered a new period of uncertainty.\n\nWe don't expect 2022 to look like 2021, especially as monetary policy tightens and fiscal policy becomes less supportive. But our confidence is as strong as it's ever been that our strategy is working and that we can help our clients navigate whatever the future holds.\n\nAs we move into 2022, I want to thank the people of Goldman Sachs. Their hard work, dedication, creativity and resilience continue to drive our success. Everywhere I go, when I meet with clients, they talk about the caliber and commitment of our people. As many of our teams have returned to our offices around the world, we have had a chance to reconnect and rediscover what makes Goldman Sachs such an extraordinary firm - in particular our exceptional talent and our collaborative culture.",

        "page_content": "## Letter to Shareholders\n\nProgress is by no means a straight line, and we are staying nimble as we continue to bring our people together as much as possible. But we believe it's important that the next generation of Goldman Sachs colleagues - many of whom are early in their careers - experience our apprenticeship culture firsthand as we work together to serve our clients.\n\nBuilding on the enormous progress we have made, I look forward to all that we will accomplish together in the year ahead. It is a great privilege to lead this remarkable organization, and I couldn't be more grateful to our leadership team: our president and chief operating officer, John Waldron; our former chief financial officer (CFO), Stephen Scherr; our new CFO, Denis Coleman; and our entire Management Committee.\n\nUnlocking the power of our franchise for our clients is not only driving growth in our core businesses, but also allowing new initiatives to scale and in the years ahead, we will continue to drive returns for our shareholders.\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nIn 2021, all four of our business segments saw revenue growth year over year. Investment Banking generated record net revenues of $14.88 billion and ranked #1 in worldwide announced and completed M&A, equity and equity-related offerings, common stock offerings and IPOs. 2 Global Markets net revenues of $22.08 billion were the highest in 12 years. Asset Management generated record net revenues of $14.92 billion; with $2.5 trillion in firmwide assets under supervision (AUS), we are one of the largest\n\n## Our Strategy to Produce Higher, More Consistent Returns\n\n- 1. Grow and Strengthen Existing Businesses\n- 2. Diversify Our Products and Services\n- 3. Operate More E/fficiently\n\n- 'Unlocking the power of our franchise for our clients is not only driving growth in our core businesses, but also allowing new initiatives to scale\u2026'\n\n## David Solomon\n\nactive asset managers in the world. And Consumer & Wealth Management generated record net revenues of $7.47 billion, with over $1 trillion in total client assets. 3\n\nWe believe book-value growth underpins the long-term value of any large, diversified financial institution and, in last year's somewhat unique operating environment, we were able to grow our book value per common share by 20.4 percent to $284.39. And though some of our businesses are more cyclical than others, we believe we can deliver returns for our shareholders in almost any environment.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nIn January 2020, we laid out our three-part strategic plan: We were going to 1) grow and strengthen our existing businesses; 2) diversify our products and services; and 3) operate our firm more efficiently, all in an effort to produce higher, more consistent returns. And though the market environment since then has looked nothing like what we expected, we've done very well: Today, we're tracking more than 30 key performance indicators and we believe we will meet or exceed 95 percent of them.\n\nKey to our success has been a renewed focus on clients. Through our One Goldman Sachs initiative, we are unlocking the power of our franchise by providing more comprehensive and integrated service while also using our network of clients to support our growth. For instance, over 90 percent of the clients on our Transaction banking platform already had relationships with the firm. Our progress confirms one of our core beliefs: that if you really take care of your clients, if you invest in those relationships and if you build trust over a long period of time, good things will happen.",

        "page_content": "Confident in our strategy, we recently unveiled an updated set of financial targets. In the medium term, 4 we believe we can achieve an ROE of 14-16 percent and an ROTE of 15-17 percent. We also reaffirmed our target efficiency ratio of approximately 60 percent. In addition, we announced that our target is to maintain our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis points.\n\nIn addition to our firmwide targets, we unveiled an updated set of business-level targets tied to our growth strategy. Our new targets are $350 billion in organic, traditional, long-term fee-based AUS net inflows over the period from 2020 to 2024; 5 $225 billion in gross alternatives fundraising over that same period; more than $10 billion in firmwide management and other fees in 2024, including more than $2 billion from alternative AUS; approximately $750 million in net revenues in Transaction banking in 2024; and over $4 billion in net revenues in Consumer banking in 2024.\n\n## Segment Performance\n\nOur four segments create a very powerful ecosystem, and in 2021 they continued to grow.\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nWe've been #1 in global completed M&A for 22 of the past 23 years and, in 2021, we were once again the advisor of choice. Net revenues were 58 percent higher than in 2020, driven by record net revenues in both Financial advisory and Underwriting. Corporate lending net revenues were significantly higher as well. In the past two years, we've grown our wallet share by approximately 350 basis\n\npoints 6 and we still see ample room for growth: Our backlog was already high, but during 2021, it grew even more, putting us in a strong position for 2022.\n\n## Global Markets\n\nAlthough market volatility declined in 2021, our clients continued to rely on us for risk management, financial intermediation and, increasingly, financing. Net revenues grew by 4 percent to $22.08 billion. In Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC), net revenues declined, but in Equities they grew by 20 percent. Since 2019, we've grown wallet share by approximately 250 basis points. 7 We're in the top 3 with 72 of the 100 top institutional clients, up from 51 just two years ago. 8 We also ended the year with record average balances in our prime services business.\n\n## Asset Management\n\nNet revenues grew by 87 percent, fueled by significantly higher net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments. Incentive fees rose, and Management and other fees were a record, reflecting higher average AUS. Growing these durable fees is an area of strategic focus. And in August 2021, we announced that we would acquire leading European asset manager NN Investment Partners (NNIP) in early 2022. NNIP's world-class ESG capabilities and strong footprint in Europe will help us further strengthen what is already one of the leading asset management businesses in the world.\n\n## Consumer & Wealth Management\n\nWe continue to empower our millions of clients and customers around the world to reach their financial goals. In 2021, net revenues grew by 25 percent to $7.47 billion. Net revenues in Wealth Management grew by 25 percent\n\n## Medium-Term 4 Firmwide Targets\n\nReturn on Equity\n\nReturn on Tangible Equity\n\n14-16%\n\n15-17%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n~60% E/fficiency Ratio",

        "page_content": "## Letter to Shareholders\n\nto a record $5.98 billion, fueled by higher average AUS, increased client demand for alternative investments and significantly higher net revenues in Private banking and lending. In Consumer banking, net revenues grew by 23 percent to a record $1.49 billion, reflecting higher credit card and deposit balances.\n\n## Growth Initiatives\n\nIn 2021, we made good progress on our growth initiatives. In many instances, we met our medium-term goals ahead of schedule.\n\n## Transaction Banking\n\nI hear from clients constantly that our innovative cloudbased Transaction banking platform is a differentiator. We expanded to the U.K. in June 2021 and, today, we have approximately 350 corporate clients. To extend the platform's reach, we've formed partnerships with American Express, Fiserv, Stripe and Visa; and less than two years in, we have already surpassed our previous five-year-plus target of $50 billion in deposits. Now our target for 2024 is to exceed $100 billion in deposits. Our progress has reinforced our confidence that we can serve this very large addressable market, and we believe it will be accretive to our ROE at scale.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nToday, we are one of the top 5 alternative asset managers in the world. 9 In 2021, we raised $67 billion in third-party capital across a diverse array of asset classes, including private equity, private credit, growth equity and real estate. That brings us to a total of $107 billion, over twothirds of our previous five-year goal of $150 billion. As a result, we have set a new target for 2024 of $225 billion in gross alternatives fundraising. We've also made significant progress in harvesting our on-balance equity investments over the past two years, with roughly $12 billion in net dispositions since year-end 2019.\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nWe deliver a world-class, tailored wealth management offering to individuals, families, family offices and nonprofit institutions. In 2021, we had strong long-term fee-based AUS net inflows and continued to expand our global footprint. Our Wealth Management business comprises our premier Private Wealth Management\n\nbusiness and our Personal Financial Management Group, which includes Ayco and Personal Financial Management (previously United Capital). Through Ayco we provide a wide variety of workplace solutions for 475 companies to a broad set of our corporate clients' employees, personalized planning and advisory services for senior executives, as well as full-service, bespoke wealth management solutions for the C-suite.\n\n## Digital Consumer Banking\n\nThis year, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of our digital consumer banking platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs , and in that time, we've made enormous progress. Our Consumer business has grown to serve more than 10 million customers and $110 billion in deposits, and it is putting our customers at the center of everything we do, signified by winning several significant industry awards and recognitions from J.D. Power, Which? Awards and more. In September 2021, we announced an agreement to acquire GreenSky, the largest fintech platform for home improvement consumer loan originations, whose growing network of over 10,000 merchants will allow us to meet more customers where they transact. We launched critical product releases and features in 2021, including the Marcus app on the iOS app store in the U.K. and Apple Card Family Plan, and we launched the My GM Rewards Card in January 2022. We also look forward to launching our digital checking product in 2022, which will allow us to become the primary bank for our customers.\n\n## Operating More Efficiently\n\nIn 2021, operating expenses were $31.94 billion, 10 percent higher than in 2020, primarily because we increased our people's compensation to reward their exceptional performance. While compensation and benefits expenses were up by 33 percent, our 2021 compensation ratio net of provision for credit losses declined by 210 basis points from the prior year. It's important to note that when this firm went public in 1999, this ratio was over 50 percent. Since then, it has decreased by more than 20 percentage points. However, it is not as relevant a metric as it was before, as we are aiming for a 60 percent efficiency ratio target, and we're managing both our compensation and non-compensation expenses fluidly.",

        "page_content": "We are a pay-for-performance culture; we reward our people who drive our growth. But we have a shareholderaligned compensation framework that relies heavily on equity awards to incentivize long-term value creation, and that compensation can be adjusted when performance is not as robust.\n\nSince January 2020, we have achieved approximately $1 billion of our planned $1.3 billion in annual runrate expense efficiencies, and we expect to achieve the rest later this year. We have a flexible cost structure that enables us to make investments and support returns, including disciplined expense management, a focus on platforms and digitization, and a priority list of investment spending.\n\n## Technology\n\nThis year showed how important engineering and technology will be to the future of Goldman Sachs. In 2021, we expanded our fully cloud-based digital businesses and features, including Apple Card Family Plan, My GM Rewards Card and Transaction banking. We also created a series of foundational cloud-based Developer platforms on which our businesses and our clients can easily build new applications. One of our most exciting announcements came in November, when we launched Financial Cloud Data at AWS re:Invent. This platform will offer GS Data and Analytics tools in the cloud to help developers build data-driven applications. And to support all these new offerings, we continue to strengthen the team by recruiting world-class engineering talent.\n\n## Our People and Our Culture\n\nGoldman Sachs has long been known for the quality of its people, and our exceptional results in 2021 made clear just how differentiated they are. We have an abundance of talent, no doubt, but beyond that, we also have a distinctly collaborative culture, which we have worked hard to preserve over the course of the pandemic. We have welcomed thousands of new people to our firm in the past few years, and it was important to us that they experience firsthand what it's like to build a career at Goldman Sachs. They are at a moment in their careers when learning from their team members and developing a network are crucial to their professional growth. And\n\nworking together in person makes it far easier for us to pass on our core values of partnership, excellence, client service and integrity.\n\nOur people's health and safety are our top priority, and while we are adapting our plans to the specific needs of each office location, we continue to make progress in bringing our people back together as much as safely possible. We will always give our people the flexibility they need to manage their lives, but throughout 2021, our experience showed that we are stronger when we're together, and protecting and enhancing our culture will remain a focus for us as we enter 2022.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIn 2021, sustainability continued to gain momentum in the economy at large and, at Goldman Sachs, we made further progress toward our goal of supporting $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity by 2030. By year end, we had achieved approximately $300 billion of our goal, including $167 billion in climate transition, $50 billion in inclusive growth and the remainder in multiple themes, reflecting\n\n## Sustainable Finance Commitment\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a financial institution, we believe the most meaningful role we can play in the global climate transition is to drive decarbonization in the real economy in partnership with our clients. This requires growing our commercial capabilities and investing in innovation. We also need reliable data, so we are working with corporate partners to develop a free, open source platform for climate-related data and to equip our clients with new impact-measuring tools, like our Carbon Portfolio Analytics in Marquee.\n\nStill, we will not succeed in our effort unless the public and private sector work together. Financial institutions like ours need to direct capital to sustainable solutions in emerging markets. That's why we've partnered with Bloomberg Philanthropies to launch a Climate Innovation Fund that will encourage public and private investment in clean energy projects across South and Southeast Asia. We also need thoughtful public policy that strikes a balance between current energy capabilities and support for new technology, as well as concrete measures that will accelerate a just and orderly transition.\n\nAfter all, that's what this is: a transition. We recognize the need to build a more sustainable planet, and we're doing our part to help the world get there.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nAdvancing diversity and inclusion is a top priority of mine. In 2021, we continued to make progress promoting change both in the world at large and within the firm. In July 2021, we strengthened our board diversity requirement. We will now underwrite IPOs for companies in Western Europe and the U.S. only if they have at least two diverse board members, at least one of whom must be a woman. We also advanced progress on closing the opportunity gap through our investment and philanthropic efforts, such as the One Million Black Women initiative. In addition, we made headway with our hiring goals at the analyst, associate and vice president levels, and our 2021 managing director class was the most diverse to date. That said, we still have much work to do to build and retain a pipeline of diverse leadership, and we are hiring additional diversity recruiters, as well as expanding our sponsorship and development programs for diverse talent at the firm.\n\n## One Million Black Women\n\nIn March 2021, we launched our newest initiative, One Million Black Women , with the goal of investing $10 billion to improve the lives of at least 1 million Black women by 2030. Since then we've made investments and grants laying the groundwork to directly impact the lives of over 98,000 women across the country. In direct response to input received from nearly 20,000 Black women and girls, we recently announced two new programs, OMBW Black in Business, focused on Black women sole proprietors,\n\n## One Million Black Women\n\n- \u00b7   Goal of investing $10 billion to improve the lives of at least 1 million Black women by 2030\n- \u00b7   Held more than 50 listening sessions with nearly 20,000 Black women and girls across the U.S.\n- \u00b7   Launched new programs focused on Black women sole proprietors and nonpro/fit leaders",

You should read the cautionary notes on forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Endnotes\n\n- 1   ROTE is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders' equity. Tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Management believes that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally, and that tangible common shareholders' equity is meaningful because it is a measure that the firm and investors use to assess capital adequacy. ROTE and tangible common shareholders' equity are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

We are dedicated to complying fully with the letter and spirit of the laws, rules and ethical principles that govern us. Our continued success depends upon unswerving adherence to this standard.\n\n## Our goal is to provide superior returns to our shareholders.\n\nProfitability is critical to achieving superior returns, building our capital, and attracting and keeping our best people. Significant employee stock ownership aligns the interests of our employees and our shareholders.\n\n## We take great pride in the professional quality of our work.\n\nWe have an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in everything we undertake. Though we may be involved in a wide variety and heavy volume of activity, we would, if it came to a choice, rather be best than biggest.\n\n## We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do.\n\nWhile recognizing that the old way may still be the best way, we constantly strive to find a better solution to a client's problems. We pride ourselves on having pioneered many of the practices and techniques that have become standard in the industry.\n\n## We make an unusual effort to identify and recruit the very best person for every job.\n\nAlthough our activities are measured in billions of dollars, we select our people one by one. In a service business, we know that without the best people, we cannot be the best firm.\n\n## We offer our people the opportunity to move ahead more rapidly than is possible at most other places.\n\nAdvancement depends on merit and we have yet to find the limits to the responsibility our best people are able to assume. For us to be successful, our people must reflect the diversity of the communities and cultures in which we operate. That means we must attract, retain and motivate people from many backgrounds and perspectives. Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\n\n## We stress teamwork in everything we do.\n\nWhile individual creativity is always encouraged, we have found that team effort often produces the best results. We have no room for those who put their personal interests ahead of the interests of the firm and its clients.\n\n## The dedication of our people to the firm and the intense effort they give their jobs are greater than one finds in most other organizations.\n\nWe think that this is an important part of our success.\n\n## We consider our size an asset that we try hard to preserve.\n\nWe want to be big enough to undertake the largest project that any of our clients could contemplate, yet small enough to maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the esprit de corps that we all treasure and that contribute greatly to our success.\n\n## We constantly strive to anticipate the rapidly changing needs of our clients and to develop new services to meet those needs.\n\nWe know that the world of finance will not stand still and that complacency can lead to extinction.\n\n## We regularly receive confidential information as part of our normal client relationships.\n\nTo breach a confidence or to use confidential information improperly or carelessly would be unthinkable.\n\n## Our business is highly competitive, and we aggressively seek to expand our client relationships.\n\nHowever, we must always be fair competitors and must never denigrate other firms.\n\n## Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business.\n\nWe expect our people to maintain high ethical standards in everything they do, both in their work for the firm and in their personal lives.",

Business\n\n## Introduction\n\nGoldman Sachs is a leading global financial institution that delivers a broad range of financial services across investment banking, securities, investment management and consumer banking to a large and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Our purpose is to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. Our goal, reflected in our One Goldman Sachs initiative, is to deliver the full range of our services and expertise to support our clients in a more accessible, comprehensive and efficient manner, across businesses and product areas.\n\nWhen we use the terms 'Goldman Sachs,' 'we,' 'us' and 'our,' we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term 'our subsidiaries,' we mean the consolidated subsidiaries of Group Inc. References to 'this Form 10-K' are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. All references to 2021, 2020 and 2019 refer to our years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n\nGroup Inc. is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company (FHC) regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA(GS Bank USA), is a New York State-chartered bank.\n\n## Our Business Segments\n\nWe report our activities in four business segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer & Wealth Management. Investment Banking generates revenues from financial advisory, underwriting and corporate lending activities. Global Markets consists of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities, and generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities. Asset Management generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, equity investments, and lending and debt investments. Consumer & Wealth Management consists of Wealth management and Consumer banking, and generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, private banking and lending, and consumeroriented activities.\n\nThe chart below presents our four business segments and their revenue sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nInvestment Banking serves public and private sector clients around the world. We provide financial advisory services, help companies raise capital to strengthen and grow their businesses and provide financing to corporate clients. We seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with a diverse global group of institutional clients, including corporations, governments, states and municipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional clients all of our resources in a seamless fashion, with investment banking serving as the main initial point of contact.\n\nInvestment Banking generates revenues from the following:\n\n- % Financial advisory. We have been a leader for many years in providing financial advisory services, including strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin-offs. In particular, we help clients execute large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including cross-border structuring expertise. We also assist our clients in managing their asset and liability exposures and their capital.\n- % Underwriting. We help companies raise capital to fund their businesses. As a financial intermediary, our job is to match the capital of our investing clients, who aim to grow the savings of millions of people, with the needs of our public and private sector clients, who need financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver products and services. Our underwriting activities include public offerings and private placements, including local and cross-border transactions and acquisition financing, of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including loans. Underwriting consists of the following:",

        "page_content": "Equity underwriting . We underwrite common and preferred stock and convertible and exchangeable securities. We regularly receive mandates for large, complex transactions and have held a leading position in worldwide public common stock offerings and worldwide initial public offerings for many years.\n\nDebt underwriting . We underwrite and originate various types of debt instruments, including investmentgrade and high-yield debt, bank and bridge loans, including in connection with acquisition financing, and emerging- and growth-market debt, which may be issued by, among others, corporate, sovereign, municipal and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities.\n\n- % Corporate lending. We lend to corporate clients, including through relationship lending, middle-market lending and acquisition financing. The hedges related to this lending and financing activity are reported as part of our corporate lending activity.\n\nWe also provide transaction banking services, including to certain of our corporate and financial institution clients. Transaction banking revenues include net interest income attributed to transaction banking deposits.\n\n## Global Markets\n\nGlobal Markets serves our clients who buy and sell financial products, raise funding and manage risk. We do this by acting as a market maker and offering market expertise on a global basis. Global Markets makes markets and facilitates client transactions in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In addition, we make markets in, and clear client transactions on, major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide.\n\nAs a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At times, we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available, and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets. In connection with our market-making activities, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory).\n\nOur clients are institutions that are primarily professional market participants, including investment entities whose ultimate clients include individual investors investing for their retirement, buying insurance or saving surplus cash.\n\nWe execute a high volume of transactions for our clients in large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury securities, stocks and certain agency mortgage pass-through securities). We also execute transactions for our clients in less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate bonds, emerging market currencies and certain non-agency mortgage-backed securities) for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets. Additionally, we structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients' risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs (such as a jet fuel hedge for an airline), as well as derivative transactions related to client advisory and underwriting activities.\n\nThrough our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. Much of this connectivity between us and our clients is maintained on technology platforms, including Marquee , and operates globally where markets are open for trading. Marquee provides institutional investors with market intelligence, risk analytics, proprietary datasets and trade execution across multiple asset classes.\n\nGlobal Markets and our other businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research division, which, as of December 2021, provided fundamental research on approximately 3,000 companies worldwide and approximately 50 national economies, as well as on industries, currencies and commodities.\n\nGlobal Markets activities are organized by asset class and include both 'cash' and 'derivative' instruments. 'Cash' refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). 'Derivative' refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa).",

In addition, we provide our hedge fund and other clients with a technology platform and reporting that enables them to monitor their security portfolios and manage risk exposures.\n\nWe provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients' short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in broker-to-broker securities lending and third-party agency lending activities.\n\nWe provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. We earn a spread equal to the difference between the amount we pay for funds and the amount we receive from our client.\n\nWe execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices.",

Their importance has been highlighted by (i) the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the work-from-home arrangements implemented by companies worldwide in response, including us, (ii) numerous highly publicized events in recent years, including cyber attacks against financial institutions, governmental agencies, large consumer-based companies, software and information technology service providers and other organizations, some of which have resulted in the unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal information and other sensitive or confidential information, the theft and destruction of corporate information and requests for ransom payments, and (iii) extreme weather events.\n\nOur Business Continuity & Technology Resilience Program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities or of our systems, and to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of FINRA. Because we are a BHC, our Business Continuity & Technology Resilience Program is also subject to review by the FRB. The key elements of the program are crisis management, business continuity, technology resilience, business recovery, assurance and verification, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology designed to protect the information provided to us by our clients and our own information from cyber attacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss. Safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. For further information about the Business Continuity Planning strategy we have implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory and Other Matters - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Human Capital Management\n\nOur people are our greatest asset.

We invest heavily in developing and supporting our people throughout their careers, and we strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, high standards of business ethics, diversity, teamwork and cooperation among our employees worldwide.",

        "page_content": "## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nThe strength of our culture, our ability to execute our strategy, and our relationships with clients all depend on a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment that encourages a wide range of perspectives. We believe that diversity at all levels of our organization, from entry-level analysts to senior management, as well as the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board), which as of December 2021, was approximately 62% diverse by race, gender or sexual orientation, is essential to our sustainability. Our management team works closely with our Global Inclusion and Diversity Committee to continue to increase diversity of our global workforce at all levels. In addition, we have global and regional Inclusion and Diversity Committees which promote an environment that values different perspectives, challenges conventional thinking and maximizes the potential of all our people.\n\nWe believe that increased diversity, including diversity of experience, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and veteran status, in addition to being a social imperative, is vital to our commercial success through the creativity that it fosters. For this reason, we have established a comprehensive action plan with aspirational diversity hiring goals which are set forth below and are focused on cultivating an inclusive environment for all our colleagues.\n\nDiverse leadership is crucial to our long-term success and to driving innovation, and we have implemented and expanded outreach and career advancement programs for rising diverse executive talent. For example, we are focused on providing diverse vice presidents the necessary coaching, sponsorship and advocacy to support their career trajectories and strengthen their leadership platforms, including through programs, such as our Vice President Career Investment Initiative focused on high-performing Black and Hispanic/Latinx VPs in the Americas and EMEA. Many other career development initiatives are aimed at fostering diverse talent at the analyst and associate level, including the Black Analyst and Associate Initiative, the Hispanic/Latinx Analyst Initiative and the Women's Career Strategies Initiative. We have also established Inclusion Networks and Interest Forums that are open to all professionals at Goldman Sachs to promote and advance connectivity, understanding, inclusion and diversity.\n\nProgress Toward Aspirational Goals. Reflecting our efforts to increase diversity, the composition of our most recent partnership class was 27% women professionals, 17% Asian professionals, 7% Black professionals and 5% Hispanic/Latinx professionals. The composition of our most recent managing director class was 30% women professionals, 28% Asian professionals, 5% Black professionals and 5% Hispanic/Latinx professionals.\n\nWehave also set forth the following aspirational goals:\n\n- % We aim for analyst and associate hiring (which accounts for over 70% of our annual hiring) to achieve representation of 50% women professionals, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the U.K. In 2021, our analyst and associate hires included 45% women professionals, 11% Black professionals and 15% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 14% Black professionals in the U.K.\n- % We aim for women professionals to represent 40% of our vice presidents globally by 2025 and 30% of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K. by 2023, while also endeavoring for women employees to comprise 50% of all of our employees globally over time. As of December 2021, women professionals represented 32% of our vice president population globally and 31% of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K., and women employees represented 41% of all of our employees globally.\n- % We aim for Black professionals to represent 7% of our vice president population in the Americas and in the U.K., and for Hispanic/Latinx professionals to represent 9% of our vice president population in the Americas, both by 2025. As of December 2021, Black professionals represented 4% of our vice president population in the Americas and 4% in the U.K., and Hispanic/Latinx professionals represented 6% of our vice president population in the Americas.\n- % We aim to double the number of campus hires in the U.S. recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by 2025 relative to 2020.\n\nThe metrics above are based on self-identification.",

        "page_content": "## Talent Development and Retention\n\nWe seek to help our people achieve their full potential by investing in them and supporting a culture of continuous development. Our goals are to maximize individual capabilities, increase commercial effectiveness and innovation, reinforce our culture, expand professional opportunities, and help our people contribute positively to their communities.\n\nInstilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars through Goldman Sachs University. To accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and networking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year. For our more senior employees, we provide guidance and training on how to manage people and projects effectively, exhibit strong leadership and exemplify our culture. We are also focused on developing a high performing, diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next generation of leaders. We maintain a variety of programs aimed at employees' professional growth and support throughout their careers and as they evolve into leaders, including initiatives, such as our Vice President and Managing Director Leadership Acceleration Initiatives.\n\nEnhancing our people's experience of internal mobility is a key focus, as we believe that this will inspire employees, help retain top talent and create diverse experiences to build future leaders.\n\nAnother important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees whom they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach and includes an evaluation of an employee's performance with respect to risk management, protecting our reputation, adherence to our code of conduct, compliance, and diversity and inclusion principles. Our approach to evaluating employee performance centers on providing robust, timely and actionable feedback that facilitates professional development. We have directed our managers, as leaders at the firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. We have also implemented 'The Three Conversations at GS' through which managers establish goals with their team members at the start of the year, check in mid-year on progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance against goals.\n\nWe believe that our people value opportunities to contribute to their communities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction. We also believe that being able to volunteer together with colleagues and participate in community organizations working on local service projects strengthens our people's bond with us. Community TeamWorks, our signature volunteering initiative, enables our people to participate in high-impact, team-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. During 2021, our people volunteered approximately 80,000 hours of service globally through Community TeamWorks, with approximately 15,000 employees partnering with approximately 370 nonprofit organizations on approximately 800 community projects. To respond to the interest of our people in helping with the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed a series of opportunities to support vulnerable populations remotely, including small business owners, students and the elderly.\n\n## Wellness\n\nWe recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace they need support in their personal, as well as their professional lives. We have created a strong support framework for wellness, which is intended to enable employees to better balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. In addition to providing 20 weeks of parental leave for all employees, we provide other benefits to support the wellness of our employees, including family care leave, bereavement leave and, for longertenured employees, an unpaid sabbatical leave. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our people a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. We have increased the availability of these resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings with the aim of maintaining the physical and mental well-being of our employees, enhancing their effectiveness and cohesiveness and providing them with greater opportunities to access support.\n\nWe also introduced a COVID-19 10-day family leave policy, available to our people globally to care for family members due to COVID-19 related illness or meet childcare needs, including homeschooling. We remain focused on facilitating the safe return of our employees to our offices, as circumstances permit, and employees in a number of our locations around the world have returned to the office to varying degrees. Given that the situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic varies geographically, our approach to transitioning back to the office is tailored to each location, and it evolves based on the specific conditions and requirements of each location. We have comprehensive protocols in place, including regular testing, and we will continue to be guided by a people-first approach as circumstances evolve.",

Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. As of December 2021, we had headcount of 43,900, offices in over 35 countries and 52% of our headcount was based in the Americas, 18% in EMEA and 30% in Asia. Our employees come from over 180 countries and speak more than 110 languages as of December 2021.\n\nIn addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers around the world, we have established key strategic locations, including in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore and Warsaw. We continue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations, including cities in which we do not currently have a presence.\n\nAs of December 2021, 40% of our employees were working in one of these key strategic locations. We believe our investment in these strategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence around specific capabilities that support our business initiatives.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe have a long-standing commitment to sustainability. Our two priorities in this area are helping clients across industries facilitate and thrive in a low-carbon economy (Climate Transition) and leveraging our capabilities to advance economic empowerment (Inclusive Growth).\n\nWe have established a Sustainable Finance Group, which serves as the centralized group that drives climate strategy and sustainability efforts across our firm, including commercial efforts alongside our businesses to advance Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. In 2020, we created a new role, Global Head of Sustainability and Inclusive Growth, which, like our One Goldman Sachs initiative, is intended to facilitate the application of our full capabilities across both Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. Each of our segments has launched a Sustainability Council. These councils focus on identifying key Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) priorities for the segment, developing sustainability-related capabilities and delivering sustainability-focused solutions to clients in a holistic way.\n\nOur activities relating to sustainability present both financial and nonfinancial risks, and we have processes for managing these risks, similar to the other risks we face. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities Committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability risks affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate changerelated risks. We have also implemented an Environmental Policy Framework to guide our overall approach to sustainability issues. We apply this Framework when evaluating transactions for environmental and social risks and impacts. Our employees also receive training with respect to environmental and social risks, including for sectors and industries that we believe have higher potential for these risks. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Overview and Structure of Risk Management - Climate Risk Management' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our climate risk management.",

        "page_content": "As a leading financial institution, we acknowledge the importance of Climate Transition for our business. In February 2021, we launched our inaugural sustainability bond of $800 million, which is aligned with our sustainable finance framework for future issuances and funds a range of on-balance sheet sustainable finance activity. In addition, we are working with various external groups to develop methods, metrics and frameworks for the financial sector, with an aim to support greater consistency, comparability and utility in approaches to measuring the financial sector's contribution to Climate Transition initiatives. We believe we can advance sustainability by partnering with our clients across our businesses, including by developing new sustainability-linked financing solutions, offering strategic advice, or coinvesting alongside our clients in clean energy companies. We have announced a target to deploy $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity by the beginning of 2030. As of December 2021, we achieved approximately 40% of that goal, with the majority dedicated to Climate Transition. In addition, we have announced our commitment to align our financing activities with a net-zero-by-2050 pathway. In that context, we have set an initial set of targets for 2030 focused on three sectors - power, oil and gas, and auto manufacturing - where we believe we can have the most significant impact and we see an opportunity to proactively engage our clients, investors, advocacy groups and multistakeholder organizations, deploy capital required for transition, and invest in new commercial solutions to drive decarbonization in the real economy. Carbon neutrality is also a priority for the operation of our firm and our supply chain. In 2015, we achieved carbon neutrality in our operations and business travel, ahead of our 2020 goal announced in 2009. We have expanded our operational carbon commitment to include our supply chain, targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.\n\nIn addition to Climate Transition, our approach to sustainability also centers on Inclusive Growth and advancing economic empowerment and financial opportunity for all. We have sponsored initiatives, such as OneMillion Black Women, Launch With GS, our Urban Investment Group, 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses . An overarching theme of our sustainability strategy is promoting diversity and inclusion as an imperative for us, as well as our clients and their boards. These efforts are further strengthened by strategic partnerships that we have established in areas where we have identified gaps, or believe we are able to drive even greater impact through collaboration. We also believe our ability to achieve our sustainability objectives is critically dependent on the strengths and talents of our people, and we recognize that our people are able to maximize their impact by collaborating in a diverse and inclusive work environment. See 'Business Human Capital Management' for information about our human capital management goals, programs and policies.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking (including transaction banking), market-making, investment management services, commercial and/or consumer lending, deposit-taking and other banking products and services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internetbased companies. We compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. We compete based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, client experience, products and services, innovation, reputation and price.\n\nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments.\n\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S.\n\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them.",

        "page_content": "A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, market-making, consumer, wealth management and asset management businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for non-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution. We and other banks also compete for deposits on the basis of the rates we offer. Increases in short-term interest rates are expected to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing.\n\nWe also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, or our competitors may develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience.\n\nThe provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the DoddFrank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking organizations and give non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S.\n\nLikewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the counterparties to the transaction. The impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes, as described further in 'Regulation' below.\n\nWe also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. See 'Regulation - Compensation Practices' and 'Risk Factors - Competition - Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about such regulation.\n\n## Regulation\n\nAs a participant in the global financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. The regulatory regimes applicable to our operations worldwide have been, and continue to be, subject to significant changes. The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation; however, its standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards. The implications of these regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop.\n\nNew regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described below. The effects of any changes to the regulations affecting our businesses, including as a result of the proposals described below, are uncertain and will not be known until such changes are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the revised regulations.",

GSBE is directly supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and additionally by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the context of the E.U. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). GSBE's London branch is regulated by the FCA. GSBE engages in certain activities primarily in the E.U., including underwriting and market making in debt and equity securities and derivatives, investment, asset and wealth management services, deposit-taking, lending (including securities lending), and financial advisory services and is a primary dealer for government bonds issued by E.U. sovereigns. On July 1, 2021, GSBE became a subsidiary of GS Bank USA. As a foreign bank subsidiary of GS Bank USA, GSBE is subject to limits on the nature and scope of its activities under the FRB's Regulation K, including limits on its underwriting and market making in equity securities based on GSBE's and/or GS Bank USA's capital.\n\nGoldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie (GSPIC) is an investment firm regulated by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority and the Financial Markets Authority. GSPIC's activities include certain activities that GSBE is prevented from undertaking. GSPIC applied in October 2021 to become a credit institution.",

        "page_content": "Our principal subsidiaries in the U.K. include GSI, a U.K. broker-dealer and a designated investment firm, and GSIB, a U.K. bank. Both GSI and GSIB are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. As an investment firm, GSI is subject to prudential requirements applicable to banks, including capital and liquidity requirements. GSI provides brokerdealer services in and from the U.K. and is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and with the SEC as a securitiesbased swap dealer. GSIB engages in lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities and is a primary dealer for U.K. government bonds. GSI and GSIB maintain branches outside of the U.K. and are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where they are located.\n\nCapital and Liquidity Requirements. We and GS Bank USA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital Framework is largely based on the Basel Committee's framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (Basel III) and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' tailoring framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to 'Category I' standards because we have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Accordingly, we and GS Bank USA are 'Advanced approach' banking organizations. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.\n\nGSBE is subject to capital and liquidity requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation, as amended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital Requirements Directive, as amended (CRD), which are largely based on Basel III.\n\nThe most recent previous amendments to the CRR and CRD (respectively, CRR II and CRD V) include changes to the market risk, counterparty credit risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks. These changes have been applicable in the E.U. since June 2021.\n\nGSI and GSIB are subject to the U.K. capital and liquidity frameworks, which are also largely based on Basel III and remain predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital and liquidity frameworks. Amendments similar to CRR II and CRD V became applicable in the U.K. on January 1, 2022. Requirements established by E.U. and U.K. authorities are therefore similar to those applicable to GS Bank USA and\n\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios. As Advanced approach banking organizations, we and GS Bank USA calculate riskbased capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Both the Advanced Capital Rules and the Standardized Capital Rules include minimum risk-based capital requirements and additional capital conservation buffer requirements that must be satisfied solely with Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Failure to satisfy a buffer requirement in full would result in constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints would depend on the amount of the shortfall and the organization's 'eligible retained income,' defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and (ii) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters. For Group Inc., the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital buffer (SCB) (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and both a countercyclical buffer and the G-SIB surcharge (under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA, the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer.\n\nThe SCB is based on the results of the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests and our planned common stock dividends and is likely to change over time based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. See 'Stress Tests and Capital Planning' below. The countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to banking organizations subject to Category I, II or III standards, including us and GS Bank USA. Several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer applicable to us may change in the future including due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes. As a result, the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to change over time.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have a rule that implements the Basel Committee's standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts (SA-CCR). Under the rule, 'Advanced approach' banking organizations are required to use SA-CCR for calculating their standardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, with some adjustments, for purposes of determining their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed below.",

        "page_content": "The capital requirements applicable to GSBE, GSI and GSIB include both minimum requirements and buffers. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management and Regulatory Capital' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about our capital ratios and those of GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and GSIB.\n\nThe Basel Committee standards include guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective (D-SIBs). Depending on how these guidelines are implemented by national regulators, they may apply, among others, to certain subsidiaries of G-SIBs. These guidelines are in addition to the framework for G-SIBs, but are more principles-based. The CRD and CRR provide that institutions that are systemically important at the E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements, according to their degree of systemic importance (O-SII buffers). In 2021, BaFin identified GSBE as an O-SII in Germany and set an O-SII buffer, applicable from January 1, 2022.\n\nIn the U.K., the PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an O-SII but has not applied an O-SII buffer.\n\nThe Basel Committee has finalized revisions to the framework for calculating capital requirements for market risk as part of its Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). These revisions are expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations and large broker-dealers subject to bank capital requirements. The revised framework, among other things, revises the standardized and internal model-based approaches used to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators implement the revised framework by January 1, 2023. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing the revised framework. Under the CRR, E.U. financial institutions commenced reporting their market risk calculations under the revised framework in the third quarter of 2021. U.K. authorities have not yet proposed rules to implement this framework.\n\nThe Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (Basel III Revisions). These standards set a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach. They also revise the Basel Committee's standardized and internal model-based approaches for credit risk, provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital and revise the frameworks for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators implement these standards by January 1, 2023, and that the new floor be phased in through January 1, 2028. In July 2020, the Basel Committee finalized further revisions to the framework for CVA risk, which are intended to align that framework with the market risk framework.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the Basel III Revisions for purposes of their risk-based capital ratios. The European Commission proposed rules to implement the Basel III Revisions in October 2021. The proposed E.U. rules contemplate amendments to the CRR and the CRD, referred to as CRR III and CRD VI, to take effect in January 2025. The U.K. authorities have not yet released a proposal on the Basel III Revisions.\n\nThe Basel Committee has also published an updated securitization framework and a revised G-SIB assessment methodology, but the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing them. The updated securitization framework has been implemented in the E.U. and U.K.\n\nLeverage Ratios. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs established by the FRB. As a G-SIB, the SLR requirements applicable to us include both a minimum requirement and a buffer requirement, which operates in the same manner as the risk-based buffer requirements described above. In April 2018, the FRB and the OCC issued a proposed rule which would (i) replace the current 2% SLR buffer for G-SIBs, including us, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB surcharge and (ii) revise the 6% SLR requirement for Category I banks, such as GS Bank USA, to be 'well capitalized' with a requirement equal to 3% plus 50% of their parent's G-SIB surcharge. This proposal, together with the adopted rule requiring use of SA-CCR for purposes of calculating the SLR, would implement certain of the revisions to the leverage ratio framework published by the Basel Committee in December 2017.",

        "page_content": "GSBE and certain of our U.K. entities, including GSI and GSIB, are also subject to requirements relating to leverage ratios, which are generally based on the Basel Committee leverage ratio standards.\n\nSee 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management and Regulatory Capital' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about our and GS Bank USA's Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs, and GSI's leverage ratio.\n\nLiquidity Ratios. The Basel Committee's framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).\n\nThe LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA is generally consistent with the Basel Committee's framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. We and GS Bank USA are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. See 'Available Information' below and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management and Regulatory Capital' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about our average daily LCR.\n\nGSBE is subject to the LCR rule issued by the European Commission, and GSI and GSIB are subject to the U.K. prudential framework's LCR rules. These rules are generally consistent with the Basel Committee's framework.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance sheet activities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The Basel Committee's NSFR framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule, which became effective in July 2021, implementing the NSFR for large U.S. banking organizations, including us and GS Bank USA. We will be required to publicly disclose our quarterly average daily NSFR semiannually beginning in 2023. The CRR implemented the NSFR for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE, which became effective in June 2021. The NSFR requirement implemented in the U.K. became effective in January 2022 and is applicable to both GSI and GSIB.\n\nThe FRB's enhanced prudential standards require BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separate requirement. GSBE also has its own liquidity planning process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). GSI and GSIB have their own liquidity planning processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the PRA's ILAAP.\n\nSee 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Overview and Structure of Risk Management' and '- Liquidity Risk Management' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about the LCR and NSFR, as well as our risk management practices and liquidity.\n\nStress Tests and Capital Planning. The FRB's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is designed to ensure that large BHCs, including us, have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. As required by the FRB, we perform an annual capital stress test and incorporate the results into an annual capital plan, which we submit to the FRB for review. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Overview and Structure of Risk Management - Capital Risk Management' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our annual capital plan. As described in 'Available Information' below, summary results of the annual stress test are published on our website.\n\nAs part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions across a range of macroeconomic and company-specific assumptions, based on our and the FRB's own stress tests.",

        "page_content": "The FRB's rule applicable to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including us, replaced the static 2.5% component of the capital conservation buffer required under the Standardized Capital Rules with the SCB. The SCB reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the CCAR stress tests, as calculated by the FRB, and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The SCB, which is subject to a 2.5% floor, is generally effective on October 1 of each year and remains in effect until October 1 of the following year, unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission of a capital plan. See 'Available Information' below and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management and Regulatory Capital' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about our SCB requirement.\n\nThe final rule implementing the SCB requires a BHC to receive the FRB's approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan.\n\nU.S. depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs are required to submit annual company-run stress test results to the FRB. As a result of recent growth in its balance sheet, GS Bank USA will be required to submit its annual stress test results in 2022. GSBE also has its own capital and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In addition, GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the PRA's ICAAP guidelines.\n\nU.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year's net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity's undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus), unless the entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval. As a result of dividend payments from GS Bank USA to Group Inc. in connection with the acquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS Bank USA cannot currently declare any dividends without regulatory approval.\n\nThe applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\n\nSource of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to act as a source of strength to their U.S. bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a BHC to a U.S. subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB's invoking its source-of-strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC.",

Transactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, including GSBE, and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued by the FRB. These laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (such as loans and other credit extensions, including credit exposure arising from resale agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions, from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of assets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions, to the extent permitted, to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. Similarly, German regulatory requirements provide that certain transactions between GSBE and GS Bank USA or its other affiliates, including Group Inc., must be on market terms and are subject to special internal approval requirements. PRA rules provide similar requirements for transactions between GSI and GSIB and their respective affiliates.\n\nThe BHC Act prohibits the FRB from requiring a payment by a BHC subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of that subsidiary objects to the payment. In that case, the FRB could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture.\n\nResolution and Recovery Plans. We are required by the FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). If these regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan or that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, they may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or may jointly order the institution to divest assets or operations, in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. The FRB and FDIC have a rule requiring U.S. G-SIBs to submit resolution plans on a two-year cycle (alternating between full and targeted submissions). We submitted our 2021 resolution plan, which was a targeted submission, in June 2021. Our next required submission is a full submission by July 1, 2023. See 'Risk Factors - The application of Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.'s security holders' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K and 'Available Information' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about our resolution plan.\n\nWe are also required by the FRB to submit, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress. Certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to similar recovery plan requirements.\n\nThe FDIC has issued a rule requiring each insured depository institution (IDI) with $50 billion or more in assets, such as GS Bank USA, to provide a resolution plan. Our resolution plan for GS Bank USA must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. GS Bank USA's most recent resolution plan was submitted in June 2018. In January 2021, the FDIC announced its intention to require resolution plan submissions for IDIs with $100 billion or more in assets, including GS Bank USA. In June 2021, the FDIC issued guidance for those resolution plans. This guidance splits covered IDIs into two groups for purposes of the timing of resolution plan submissions, and GS Bank USAis in the second group with a later submission date.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) entered into by G-SIBs. The rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed G-SIB by limiting the ability of the G-SIB to enter into a QFC unless (i) the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the G-SIB or one of its affiliates into resolution, (ii) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement, and (iii) the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (FDIA), described below. GS Bank USA has achieved compliance by adhering to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Universal Protocol) and International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol) described below.\n\nCertain of our subsidiaries also adhere to these protocols. The ISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. The U.S. ISDA Protocol, which was based on the ISDA Universal Protocol, was created to allow market participants to comply with the final QFC rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies.",

        "page_content": "The E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), as amended by the BRRD II, establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre-emptively address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers' exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member states to grant certain resolution powers to national and, where relevant, E.U. resolution authorities, including the power to impose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that contracts governed by non-E.U. law recognize those temporary stay and bail-in powers unless doing so would be impracticable. GSBE is under the direct authority of the Single Resolution Board for resolution planning. Regulatory authorities in the E.U. may require financial institutions in the E.U., including subsidiaries of non-E.U. groups, to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing resolution plans for the E.U. entities. GSBE's primary regulator with respect to recovery planning is the ECB, and it is also regulated by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank.\n\nThe U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially the same powers on the Bank of England, as the U.K. resolution authority, and substantially the same requirements on U.K. financial institutions. Further, certain U.K. financial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, are required to meet the Bank of England's expectations contained in the U.K. Resolution Assessment Framework, including with respect to loss absorbency, contractual stays, operational continuity and funding in resolution. They are also required by the PRA to submit solvent wind-down plans on how they could be wound down in a stressed environment. The PRA is also the regulatory authority in the U.K. that supervises recovery planning, and GSI and GSIB are each required to submit recovery plans to the PRA.\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The FRB has issued a rule addressing U.S. implementation of the Financial Stability Board's (FSB's) TLAC principles and term sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for G-SIBs. The rule (i) establishes minimum TLAC requirements; (ii) establishes minimum requirements for 'eligible longterm debt' (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria); (iii) prohibits certain parent company transactions; and (iv) caps the amount of parent company liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt.\n\nThe rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a U.S. G-SIB from (i) guaranteeing subsidiaries' liabilities that are subject to early termination provisions if the BHC enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt to third parties; or (iv) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties.\n\nAdditionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the parent company's eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured non-contingent third-party liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt.\n\nThe FRB, the OCC and the FDIC issued a final rule, effective April 1, 2021, requiring 'Advanced approach' banking organizations, such as us, to deduct from their own regulatory capital certain investments above thresholds in unsecured debt instruments issued by G-SIBs, including those issued for purposes of satisfying TLAC requirements.\n\nThe CRR and the BRRD are designed to, among other things, implement the FSB's minimum TLAC requirement for G-SIBs. For example, the CRR requires E.U. subsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-SIB to meet internal TLAC requirements if they exceed the threshold of 5% of the G-SIB's RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure. GSBE does not currently exceed these thresholds. Under the U.K. financial services regime, GSG UK exceeds the applicable thresholds and therefore, it is subject to internal TLACrequirements.\n\nThe CRD requires a non-E.U. group with more than \u20ac 40 billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. intermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) by December 30, 2023 if it has, as in our case, two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, including broker-dealers and banks. A non-E.U. group may have two E.U. IHCs if a request for a second is approved. The CRR requires E.U. IHCs to satisfy capital and liquidity requirements, a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), and certain other prudential requirements at a consolidated level. The U.K. has not implemented the requirement for an IHC; however, the PRA has introduced a requirement to approve or exempt certain U.K. financial holding companies, including GSG UK, which became effective in January 2022.",

In June 2018, the Bank of England published a statement of policy on internal MREL, which requires a material U.K. subsidiary of an overseas banking group, such as GSI, to meet a minimum internal MREL requirement to facilitate the transfer of losses to its resolution entity, which for GSI is Group Inc. The transitional minimum internal MREL requirement became fully effective on January 1, 2022. In order to comply with the MREL statement of policy, we have provided the Bank of England the right to exercise bail-in triggers over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bank of England to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by the Bank of England if it determines that GSI has reached the point of non-viability and the FRB and the FDIC have not objected to the bail-in or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings.\n\nInsolvency of a BHC or IDI.

Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institution's failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects.\n\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under OLA, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA are generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA, described below.\n\nSubstantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors' claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a 'bridge' entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual crossdefaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed FHC by transferring its assets to a 'bridge' holding company under its 'single point of entry' or 'SPOE' strategy pursuant to OLA.\n\nUnder the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an IDI such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power:\n\n- % To transfer any of the IDI's assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed 'bridge' bank, without the approval of the depository institution's creditors;\n- % To enforce the IDI's contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or\n- % To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the IDI is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the repudiation or disaffirmance of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the IDI.\n\nIn addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an IDI would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S. branches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the 'liquidation or other resolution' of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors at U.S. branches of GS Bank USA.",

        "page_content": "Deposit Insurance. Deposits at GS Bank USA have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on IDIs. GS Bank USA's assessment (subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period, its supervisory ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. The deposits of GSBE are covered by the German statutory deposit protection program to the extent provided by law. In addition, GSBE has elected to participate in the German voluntary deposit protection program which provides insurance for certain eligible deposits not covered by the German statutory deposit program. Deposits at GSIB are covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the applicable limits.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action. The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take 'prompt corrective action' in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.\n\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described in 'Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC' above.\n\nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHC's depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary's capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the BHC's general unsecured creditors, as described in 'Source of Strength' above.\n\nVolcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities. As a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business\n\nactivities in which we may engage.\n\nVolcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits 'proprietary trading,' but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements.\n\nIn addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, 'covered funds' (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored and advised funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the fund's net asset value, and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital.\n\nThe FRB has extended the conformance period to July 2022 for our investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy 'illiquid funds' (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about our investments in such funds.\n\nOther Restrictions. FHCs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-FHCs (merchant banking activities). In addition, certain FHCs, including us, are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5%ormore of their consolidated assets.\n\nThe FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC's ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For example, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities.",

        "page_content": "If any IDI subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at least a 'satisfactory' rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions.\n\nIn addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval before certain acquisitions and before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S.\n\nThe FRB issued a proposed rule in September 2016 which, if adopted, would impose new requirements on the physical commodity activities and certain merchant banking activities of FHCs, including, among other things, additional capital requirements, stringent quantitative limits on permissible physical trading activity, and new public reporting requirements. At that time, the FRB recommended that Congress repeal authorities for FHCs to engage in merchant banking activities and for certain FHCs to engage in certain otherwise impermissible commodities activities.\n\nU.S. G-SIBs, like us, are also required to comply with a rule regarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FRB to implement early remediation requirements, which were proposed in 2011 but not finalized.\n\nThe New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA's activities.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high-level principles for safe-and-sound leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This guidance has, among other things, limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions.\n\nAs a German credit institution, GSBE will become subject to Volcker Rule-type prohibitions under German banking law and regulations once its financial assets exceed certain thresholds. Prohibited activities will then include proprietary trading, certain types of high-frequency trading and certain types of lending and guarantee businesses with defined prohibited counterparties, such as hedge funds and other highly leveraged funds, unless an exclusion or an exemption applies. See 'Volcker Rule' above for further information.\n\nU.K. banks that have over \u00a325 billion of core retail deposits are required to separate their retail banking services from their investment and international banking activities, commonly known as 'ring-fencing.' GSIB is not currently subject to the ring-fencing requirement, and if it were to become subject to it, GSIB would need to make significant operational and structural changes.\n\n## Broker-Dealer and Securities Regulation\n\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, the use and safekeeping of clients' funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the financing of clients' purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. GS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer, a securities-based swap dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that apply to, and examine, brokerdealers such as GS&Co.\n\nU.S. state securities and other U.S. regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. For a description of net capital requirements applicable to GS&Co., see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form10-K.\n\nThe SEC issued a proposed rule in November 2021 which, if adopted, would require lenders of securities to provide the material terms of securities lending transactions to a registered national securities association, such as FINRA.\n\nIn Europe, we provide broker-dealer services, including through GSBE (which is a credit institution), GSPIC and GSI, that are subject to oversight by European and national regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with E.U., U.K. and national laws and regulations. These laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. Certain of our European subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members.\n\nGSJCL, our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japan's Financial Services Agency. GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others.",

As a market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned.\n\nIn the E.U. and the U.K., the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) includes extensive market structure reforms, such as the establishment of new trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform and enhanced pre- and post-trade transparency covering a wider range of financial instruments. In equities, MiFID II introduced volume caps on non-transparent liquidity trading for trading venues, limited the use of broker-dealer crossing networks and created a new regime for systematic internalizers, which are investment firms that execute client transactions outside a trading venue. Additional control requirements were introduced for algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific position limits. Other reforms include enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service to investors, changes to the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research, rules limiting the payment and receipt of soft commissions and other forms of inducements, and mandatory unbundling for brokerdealers between execution and other major services.\n\nThe SEC requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their customers. Additionally, SEC rules require brokerdealers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. Several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to broker-dealers.\n\nThe SEC, FINRA and regulators in various non-U.S. jurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations.\n\nGS&Co., GS Bank USA and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. For certain securitization transactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy this requirement. Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, including GSI, are subject to risk retention requirements in connection with securitization activities.\n\n## Swaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation\n\nThe commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities.\n\nThe terms 'swaps' and 'security-based swaps' include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as swaps (including certain forward contracts and options), and relate to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations.",

        "page_content": "CFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope swaps. A number of these requirements, particularly those regarding recordkeeping and reporting, also apply to transactions that do not involve a registered swap dealer. GS&Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and J. Aron, are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. CFTC rules establishing capital requirements for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB, became effective in October 2021. The CFTC has also adopted financial reporting requirements for covered swap entities and amended existing capital rules for CFTC-registered futures commission merchants to provide explicit capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared by a clearing organization. Certain of our registered swap dealers, including J. Aron, are subject to the CFTC's capital requirements.\n\nOur affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our non-bank swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). The rules for variation margin have become effective, and those for initial margin are in the process of being phased in through September 2022, depending on certain activity levels of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. Inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC and FRB margin rules are generally exempt from initial margin requirements.\n\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of securitybased swap dealers. Security-based swaps are defined as swaps on single securities, single loans or narrow-based baskets or indices of securities. The SEC has adopted a number of rules for security-based swap dealers, including (i) capital, margin and segregation requirements; (ii) recordkeeping, financial reporting and notification requirements; (iii) business conduct standards; (iv) regulatory and public trade reporting; and (v) the application of risk mitigation techniques to uncleared portfolios of security-based swaps. The compliance date for these SEC rules, as well as SEC rules addressing registration requirements and business conduct standards, was generally October 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, certain of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., registered with the SEC as securitybased swap dealers and became subject to the SEC's regulations regarding security-based swaps. The SEC has recently proposed additional regulations regarding securitybased swaps that would, among other things, require public reporting of large positions in security-based swaps.\n\nThe CFTC and the SEC have adopted rules relating to cross-border regulation of swaps, securities-based swaps, business conduct and registration requirements. The CFTC and the SEC have entered into agreements with certain non-U.S. regulators regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the mutual recognition of cross-border execution facilities and clearing houses, and have approved substituted compliance with certain non-U.S. regulations related to certain business conduct requirements and margin rules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not yet made a determination with respect to substituted compliance for transactions subject to non-U.S. margin rules.\n\nSimilar types of regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the E.U. and Japan. Under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), for example, the E.U. and the U.K. have established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities. In addition, under the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation, transactions in certain types of derivatives are required to be executed on regulated platforms or exchanges.\n\nThe CFTC has adopted rules that limit the size of positions in physical commodity derivatives that can be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading under common ownership or control. Swap dealers may currently claim an exemption from the position limits for the bona fide hedging of swap-related risks, but this exemption will be eliminated in 2023. The CFTC position limits apply to futures on physical commodities and options on such futures, and these limits apply to both physically and cash settled positions. In addition, in 2023, the position limit rules will become applicable to swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options. The position limit rules initially impose limits in the spot month only (i.e., during the delivery period for the physical commodities, which is typically a period of several days). CFTC spot and non- spot month limits will continue to apply to futures on certain legacy agricultural commodities, and it is possible that non-spot month limits will at some point be adopted for other categories of commodities.",

Additionally, SEC rules require investment advisers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. Several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to advisers.\n\nCertain of our European subsidiaries, including GSBE in the E.U. and GSAMI in the U.K., are subject to MiFID II and/or related regulations (including the U.K. legislation making such regulations part of U.K. law), which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of U.K. or E.U.-based investment managers and the ability of investment fund managers located outside the E.U. or the U.K. to access those markets. Our asset management business in the U.K. and the E.U. significantly depends on our ability to delegate parts of our activities to other affiliates.\n\nOn January 1, 2022, GSAMI became subject to a new prudential regime for U.K. investment firms, the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (IFPR), which governs the prudential requirements for U.K. investment firms prudentially regulated by the FCA.\n\n## Consumer Regulation\n\nOur U.S. consumer-oriented activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. Our consumer-oriented activities are also subject to various state and local consumer protection laws, rules and regulations, which, among other things, impose obligations relating to marketing, origination, servicing and collections activities in our consumer businesses. Many of these laws, rules and regulations also apply to our small business lending activities, which are also subject to supervision and regulation by federal and state regulators. In addition, our U.K. consumer deposit-taking activities are subject to consumer protection regulations.\n\n## Compensation Practices\n\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other regulatory bodies worldwide.\n\nThe FSB has released standards for implementation by local regulators that are designed to encourage sound compensation practices at banks and other financial companies. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have also provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization's supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness.",

The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized.\n\nThe NYDFS' guidance emphasizes that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators at banking institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, must be subject to effective risk management, oversight and control.\n\nIn the E.U., certain provisions in the CRR and CRD are designed to meet the FSB's compensation standards. These provisions limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of all employees at GSBE and of certain employees at our other operating subsidiaries in the E.U., including those employees identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of regulated entities. CRR II and CRD V amended certain aspects of these rules, including, by increasing minimum variable compensation deferral periods. Substantially similar requirements apply in the U.K. in relation to GSI and GSIB.\n\nThe E.U. has also introduced rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations\n\nThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), including by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and authorizes or mandates the promulgation of various regulations applicable to financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA seeks, among other things, to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amends the BSA, was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcementand investigationrelated authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury, issued the priorities for antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing.\n\nWe are subject to other laws and regulations worldwide relating to anti-money laundering and financial transparency, including the E.U. Anti-Money Laundering Directives. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws and regulations worldwide regarding corrupt and illegal payments, or providing anything of value, for the benefit of government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to the identification of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, monitoring direct and indirect payments to politically exposed persons, providing information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and sharing information with other financial institutions.",

These include the GLB Act, the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K.'s Data Protection Act 2018, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection Law of the People's Republic of China (PIPL), the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The GDPR has heightened our privacy compliance obligations, impacted certain of our businesses' collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed strict standards for reporting data breaches. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, the CCPA imposes compliance obligations with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The CCPA was amended in 2020 by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which, among other things, will expand the scope of data subject to the CCPA when the CPRA becomes effective on January 1, 2023. In addition, several other states and non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing, privacy and data protection laws similar to the GDPR and the CCPA. The PIPL, which went into effect on November 1, 2021, limits the legal bases for processing personal information, contains heightened notice and consent requirements for the handling of certain types of personal information and imposes special crossborder data transfer rules under certain circumstances.\n\nThe NYDFS also requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer.\n\nIn November 2021, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computersecurity incidents. Under the final rule, a BHC or state member bank, such as Group Inc. or GS Bank USA, is required to notify its primary regulator within 36 hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization's ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. The rule is effective April 1, 2022, with compliance required by May 1, 2022.\n\n## Information about our Executive Officers\n\nSet forth below are the name, age, present title, principal occupation and certain biographical information for the executive officers who have been appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, Group Inc.'s Board.\n\n## Philip R.

These conditions can change suddenly and negatively.\n\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, low inflation, business, consumer and investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings.\n\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: low levels of or declines in economic growth, business activity or investor, business or consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns; pandemics; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates; concerns about sovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory changes; limitations on international trade and travel; laws and regulations that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities of issuers outside their domestic markets; outbreaks of domestic or international tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cyber security threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.",

        "page_content": "The financial services industry and the securities and other financial markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes, by a serious lack of liquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults. In addition, concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking system, limitations on international trade, and potential or actual changes in interest rates, inflation and other market conditions, have, at times, negatively impacted the levels of client activity.\n\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market activities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory reform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has in the past negatively impacted client activity, which can adversely affect many of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market-making businesses.\n\nFinancial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has also been negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures continue to adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values, particularly where we have net 'long' positions, receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or post collateral.\n\nMany of our businesses have net 'long' positions in debt securities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity and real estate) and most other asset classes. These include positions we take when we act as a principal to facilitate our clients' activities, including our exchangebased market-making activities, or commit large amounts of capital to maintain positions in interest rate and credit products, as well as through our currencies, commodities, equities and mortgage-related activities. In addition, we invest in similar asset classes. Substantially all of our investing and market-making positions and a portion of our loans are marked-to-market on a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset values directly and promptly impact our earnings, unless we have effectively 'hedged' our exposures to those declines.\n\nIn certain circumstances (particularly in the case of credit products, including leveraged loans, and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets have in the past and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may negatively affect our capital, liquidity or leverage ratios, increase our funding costs and generally require us to maintain additional capital.\n\nIn our exchange-based market-making activities, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing securities in a declining market. In markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need for liquidity.\n\nWe receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients' portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients' portfolios or fund assets, which in turn would typically reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.",

        "page_content": "We post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that supports the obligations of our clients and counterparties. When the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline, the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading position. An example of such a situation is a 'margin call' in connection with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is decreased. If we are the party providing collateral, this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral, this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our clients and counterparties.\n\nIn addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets, which can lead to costly and timeconsuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral. In cases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the value or liquidity of the collateral has in the past and may in the future, despite credit monitoring, overcollateralization, the ability to call for additional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation, result in significant losses to us, especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legal documents, was conducted in an improper manner or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business.\n\n## Our market-making activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility.\n\nCertain of our market-making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client activity associated with them and adversely affect the results of these activities. Increased volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads, also increases risk as measured by Value-at-Risk (VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our market-making activities or cause us to reduce our inventory in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting the size of our marketmaking positions can adversely affect our profitability. In periods when volatility is increasing, but asset values are declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In those circumstances we may be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease our VaR. In addition, increases in volatility increase the level of our RWAs, which increases our capital requirements.\n\nOur investment banking, client intermediation, asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and CEOs due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market conditions.\n\nOur investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely affected investor and CEO confidence, resulting in significant industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of financial advisory transactions, which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions, a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business. Similarly, in recent years, cross-border initial public offerings and other securities offerings have accounted for a significant proportion of new issuance activity. Legislative, regulatory or other changes that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities outside the issuers' domestic markets have in the past and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting business.\n\nIn certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and even declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes or higher spreads or both.\n\nMarket uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions, as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues, principally in our asset management and wealth management businesses. Even if clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them in products that generate less fee income.",

        "page_content": "Our asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees.\n\nPoor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management businesses, due to either general market conditions or underperformance (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or sell, affects our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. This could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn on AUS or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other investment products, such as structured notes or derivatives. To the extent that our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer, we will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees. Further, if, due to changes in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise, clients continue to invest in products that generate lower fees (e.g., passively managed or fixed income products), our average effective management fee would continue to decline and our asset management and wealth management businesses could be adversely affected.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nOur liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets.\n\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. It is of critical importance to us, as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to raise or retain deposits, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments, lack of timely settlement of transactions, unusual deposit outflows, or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, such as in March 2020, when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by the perception among market participants that we, or other market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.\n\nWe employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks. The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are often complex, and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our investing and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our positions.\n\nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally a liquid market for such assets, as well as in circumstances where other market participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations. For example, recently an investment management firm with large positions with several financial institutions defaulted, resulting in rapidly declining prices in the securities underlying those positions. In addition, clearinghouses, exchanges and other financial institutions with which we interact may exercise set-off rights or the right to require additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions, which could further impair our liquidity.\n\nRegulatory changes relating to liquidity may also negatively impact our results of operations and competitive position. Numerous regulations have been adopted to introduce more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements, wholesale funding, limitations on the issuance of short-term debt and structured notes, deductions for holdings of TLAC and prohibitions on parent guarantees that are subject to certain cross-defaults. New and prospective liquidity-related regulations may overlap with, and be impacted by, other regulatory changes, including rules relating to minimum long-term debt requirements and TLAC, guidance on the treatment of brokered deposits and the capital, leverage and resolution and recovery frameworks applicable to large financial institutions. Given the overlap and complex interactions among these new and prospective regulations, they may have unintended cumulative effects, and their full impact will remain uncertain, while regulatory reforms are being adopted and market practices develop. In addition, our need to manage our operations in light of certain regulatory requirements when applicable thresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposits in GSIB or other funding, which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to respond efficiently to liquidity stress.",

We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making.\n\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of our clients' merger and acquisition transactions, particularly large transactions, and adversely affect our financial advisory and underwriting businesses.\n\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses.\n\n## Reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding.\n\nOur credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements.\n\nAs of December 2021, our counterparties could have called for additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of $345 million in the event of a one-notch downgrade of our credit ratings and $1.54 billion in the event of a two-notch downgrade of our credit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency's relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. For further information about our credit ratings, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management - Credit Ratings' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\n\nOur cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. Our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity.",

Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc.\n\nIn addition, our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions on relatedparty transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of Group Inc., including under the FRB's source of strength requirement, and even require Group Inc. to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition, Group Inc.'s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.\n\nThere has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those subsidiaries are located or do business. Concerns about protecting clients and creditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities located outside of the country in which such entities are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to 'ring fence' or require internal total loss-absorbing capacity (which may also be subject to 'bail-in' powers, as described below) at those entities in order to protect clients and creditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving those entities. The result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, or to Group Inc., including in times of liquidity stress, thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis.\n\nFurthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and GS Bank USA, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations.\n\nThe requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators, and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators, may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional long-term debt at Group Inc. or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities, and may reduce our ability to provide Group Inc. guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at Group Inc. Resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient. Furthermore, arrangements to facilitate our resolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes. Any such limitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany dividends or payments.\n\nSee 'Business - Regulation' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about regulatory restrictions.",

These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.\n\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements, could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes.\n\nA significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results. While in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress, increased volatility and illiquidity.\n\nAs part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities, we finance our clients' positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we have limits and regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.\n\n## Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities.\n\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. The number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect our results of operations in a given period. Moreover, because of concentrated risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend large commitments as part of our credit origination activities.\n\nRules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions, require issuers of certain asset-backed securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset, which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection with these securitization activities. Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market stress, could negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers) or geographic area or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries, countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated. Regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges, which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. While our activities expose us to many different industries, counterparties and countries, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearing houses, exchanges and investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties.",

Many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling positions difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying security, loan or other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk, as well as increased costs to us.\n\nDerivative transactions may also involve the risk that documentation has not been properly executed, that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty, or that obligations under such agreements may not be able to be 'netted' against other obligations with such counterparty. In addition, counterparties may claim that such transactions were not appropriate or authorized.\n\nAs a signatory to the ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA Protocol (ISDA Protocols) and being subject to the FRB's and FDIC's rules on QFCs and similar rules in other jurisdictions, we may not be able to exercise remedies against counterparties and, as this new regime has not yet been tested, we may suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to suffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a termination event. The ISDA Protocols and these rules and regulations extend to repurchase agreements and other instruments that are not derivative contracts.\n\nDerivative contracts and other transactions, including secondary bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce our rights.\n\nIn addition, as new complex derivative products are created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing of credit derivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market shift toward standardized derivatives, could reduce the risk associated with these transactions, but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge our own risks, and could adversely affect our profitability and has increased our credit exposure to central clearing platforms.\n\n## Operational\n\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, as well as human error, malfeasance or other misconduct, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards.\n\nMany rules and regulations worldwide govern our obligations to execute transactions and report such transactions and other information to regulators, exchanges and investors. Compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging, and we have been and may in the future be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely, accurate and complete information in accordance with these rules. As such requirements expand, compliance with these rules and regulations has become more challenging.",

Such risks are exacerbated in times of increased volatility. As with other similarly situated institutions, we utilize credit underwriting models in connection with our businesses, including our consumeroriented activities. Allegations, whether or not accurate, that the ultimate underwriting decisions do not treat consumers or clients fairly, or comply with the applicable law or regulation, can result in negative publicity, reputational damage and governmental and regulatory scrutiny, investigations and enforcement actions.\n\nOur financial, accounting, data processing or other operational systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. We must continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets, and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to pursue our objective of ensuring that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or, due to errors in processing such transactions, adversely affect markets, our clients and counterparties or us. Enhancements and updates to systems, as well as the requisite training, including in connection with the integration of new businesses, entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.\n\nThe use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and businesses and those of our clients and our third-party service providers and vendors. Their importance has continued to increase, in particular in light of work-from-home arrangements implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Computers and computer networks are subject to various risks, including, among others, cyber attacks, inherent technological defects, system failures and human error. For example, fundamental security flaws in computer chips found in many types of these computing devices and phones have been reported in the past and may be discovered in the future. Cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service disruptions have resulted, and may result in the future, in delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients' access to our platforms. During 2021, there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud computing providers. Addressing these and similar issues could be costly and affect the performance of these businesses and systems. Operational risks may be incurred in applying fixes and there may still be residual security risks.\n\nAdditionally, although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology and similar technologies is growing, the technology is also nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherent weaknesses. We are exposed to risks, and may become exposed to additional risks, related to distributed ledger technology, including through our facilitation of clients' activities involving financial products that use distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain or cryptocurrencies, our investments in companies that seek to develop platforms based on distributed ledger technology, the use of distributed ledger technology by third-party vendors, clients, counterparties, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries, and the receipt of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as collateral.",

Human errors, malfeasance and other misconduct, including the intentional misuse of client information in connection with insider trading or for other purposes, even if promptly discovered and remediated, has in the past and may in the future result in reputational damage and losses and liabilities for us.\n\nIn addition, we face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions, and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay with respect to our clients' systems.\n\nThere has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and an increasing number of derivative transactions are cleared on exchanges, which has increased our exposure to operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in the event of any such failure, delay, termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.\n\nThe interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business.

Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, given that our headquarters and the largest concentration of our employees are in the New York metropolitan area, and our two principal office buildings in the New York area both are located on the waterfront of the Hudson River, depending on the intensity and longevity of the event, a catastrophic event impacting our New York metropolitan area offices, including a terrorist attack, extreme weather event or other hostile or catastrophic event, could negatively affect our business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations or successfully work remotely, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication, workfrom-home arrangements or travel.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software and information technology service providers, governmental agencies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized access or disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information in recent years, as well as cyber attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced an increasing number of attempted cyber attacks as we expand our mobileand other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies, and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of individual consumers. The increasing migration of our communication from devices we provide to employee-owned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks, as do work-from-home arrangements such as those implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective service providers), central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses.\n\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, especially because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third parties who are affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to place individuals in our offices or induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data or that of our clients, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent.\n\nAlthough we take protective measures proactively and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks on our vendors and other events that could have a security impact. Risks relating to cyber attacks on our vendors have been increasing given the greater frequency and severity in recent years of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, protective measures that we employ to compartmentalize our data may reduce our visibility into, and adversely affect our ability to respond to, cyber threats and issues with our systems.",

In addition, such an event could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation.\n\nWe have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, but these measures may be ineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory action, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\n\nOur clients' confidential information may also be at risk from the compromise of clients' personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company. Losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks, as can workfrom-home arrangements. Certain aspects of the security of such technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control, and the failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential and other information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures, despite their sophistication, may be defeated, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available.\n\nWe routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.\n\n## We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\n\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. Our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from market-making, investing or lending positions, and underwriting activities, with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, in the course of our activities, we have incurred and may in the future incur losses. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk.\n\nThe models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. These types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation have been and may in the future be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets.",

In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation, we invest our own capital in private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments.\n\nPrudent risk management, as well as regulatory restrictions, may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties, geographic areas or markets, which may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities.\n\nAs we have expanded and intend to continue to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings of credit products to consumers, we are presented with different credit risks and must expand and adapt our credit risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for these business activities. A failure to adequately assess and control such risk exposures could result in losses to us.\n\nFor further information about our risk management policies and procedures, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\n\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters.\n\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, such as COVID-19, or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme weather events, solar events or other natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations and limitations on occupancy in our offices) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses.\n\nClimate change could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect client activity levels and the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties, and our efforts to address concerns relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation.\n\nClimate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary locations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients, adversely affect the value of our investments, including our real estate investments, and reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. Climate change and the transition to a less carbondependent economy may also have a negative impact on the operations or financial condition of our clients and counterparties, which may decrease revenues from those clients and counterparties and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients and counterparties. In addition, climate change may impact the broader economy.\n\nWe are also exposed to risks resulting from changes in public policy, laws and regulations, or market and public perceptions and preferences in connection with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy. These changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation. For example, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our involvement, or our clients' involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. If we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient, our business, reputation and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer.",

        "page_content": "New regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as the perspectives of regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain products. Federal and state, and non-U.S. banking regulators and supervisory authorities, shareholders and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as playing an important role in helping to address risks related to climate change, both directly and with respect to their clients, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending, investment and advisory activities. We also may become subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements relating to climate change, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements. The risks associated with, and the perspective of regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding, climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, which can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate change-related risks and uncertainties, and we expect that climate change-related risks will increase over time.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory\n\n## Our businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.\n\nAs a participant in the financial services industry and a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by law enforcement, regulatory and taxing authorities, as well as private litigation, in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. In many cases, our activities have been and may continue to be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions. Among other things, as a result of law enforcement authorities, regulators or private parties challenging our compliance with existing laws and regulations, we or our employees have been, and could be, fined, criminally charged or sanctioned; prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities; subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities, including higher capital requirements; or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our businesses or with respect to our employees. These limitations or conditions may limit our business activities and negatively impact our profitability.\n\nIn addition to the impact on the scope and profitability of our business activities, day-to-day compliance with existing laws and regulations has involved and will continue to involve significant amounts of time, including that of our senior leaders and that of a large number of dedicated compliance and other reporting and operational personnel, all of which may negatively impact our profitability.\n\nOur revenues and profitability and those of our competitors have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, additional loss-absorbing capacity, leverage, minimum liquidity and long-term funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery planning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions. The laws and regulations that apply to our businesses are often complex and, in many cases, we must make interpretive decisions regarding the application of those laws and regulations to our business activities. Changes in interpretations, whether in response to regulatory guidance, industry conventions, our own reassessments or otherwise, could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or ability to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, such as capital or liquidity requirements.\n\nIf there are new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients, including capital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, total loss-absorbing capacity and margin requirements, restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices, reporting requirements, requirements relating to recovery and resolution planning, tax burdens and compensation restrictions, that are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (whether based on size, method of funding, activities, geography or other criteria), compliance with these new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way. In addition, regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally, such as taxes on stock transfers and other financial transactions, could adversely impact levels of market activity more broadly, and thus impact our businesses. Changes to laws or regulations, such as tax laws, could also have a disproportionate impact on us, based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to financial services and financial firms or due to our corporate structure.",

Among the aspects of the DoddFrank Act that have affected or may in the future affect our businesses are: increased capital, liquidity and reporting requirements; limitations on activities in which we may engage; increased regulation of and restrictions on OTC derivatives markets and transactions; limitations on incentive compensation; limitations on affiliate transactions; requirements to reorganize or limit activities in connection with recovery and resolution planning; increased deposit insurance assessments; and increased standards of care for broker-dealers and investment advisers in dealing with clients. The implementation of higher capital requirements, more stringent requirements relating to liquidity, long-term debt and total lossabsorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietary trading and the sponsorship of, or investment in, covered funds by the Volcker Rule may continue to adversely affect our profitability and competitive position, particularly if these requirements do not apply equally to our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions. We may also become subject to higher and more stringent capital and other regulatory requirements as a result of the implementation of Basel Committee standards, including the new credit and operational risk capital standards published in December 2017 and the new market risk capital standard published in January 2019.\n\nAs described in 'Business - Regulation - Banking Supervision and Regulation' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, the SCB has replaced the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Capital Rules and resulted in higher Standardized capital ratio requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could limit our ability to, among other things, repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. In addition, if, as in 2020, we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we generally may not make capital distributions, such as share repurchases or dividends, without the prior approval of the FRB. Dividends and repurchases are also subject to oversight by the FRB, which can result in limitations. Limitations on our ability to make capital distributions could, among other things, prevent us from returning capital to our shareholders and impact our return on equity. Additionally, as a G-SIB, we are subject to the G-SIB surcharge. Our G-SIB surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year. Expansion of our businesses, growth in our balance sheet and increased reliance on short-term wholesale funding have resulted in increases and in the future may result in further increases in our G-SIB surcharge and a corresponding increase in our capital requirements.\n\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase.\n\nIn addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation, corruption or loss of information or technology.",

        "page_content": "We have entered into consumer-oriented deposit-taking, lending and credit card businesses, and we expect to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings. Entering into these businesses subjects us to numerous additional regulations in the jurisdictions in which these businesses operate. Not only are these regulations extensive, but they involve types of regulations and supervision, as well as regulatory compliance risks, that have not historically applied to us. The level of regulatory scrutiny and the scope of regulations affecting financial interactions with consumers is often much greater than that associated with doing business with institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Complying with these regulations is timeconsuming, costly and presents new and increased risks.\n\nIncreasingly, regulators and courts have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where they have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client. Regulators and courts have also increasingly found liability as a 'control person' for activities of entities in which financial institutions or funds controlled by financial institutions have an investment, but which they do not actively manage. In addition, regulators and courts continue to seek to establish 'fiduciary' obligations to counterparties to which no such duty had been assumed to exist. To the extent that such efforts are successful, the cost of, and liabilities associated with, engaging in brokerage, clearing, market-making, prime brokerage, investing and other similar activities could increase significantly. To the extent that we have fiduciary obligations in connection with acting as a financial adviser or investment adviser or in other roles for individual, institutional, sovereign or investment fund clients, any breach, or even an alleged breach, of such obligations could have materially negative legal, regulatory and reputational consequences.\n\nFor information about the extensive regulation to which our businesses are subject, see 'Business - Regulation' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\n\n## A failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nDue to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of that client or another client, as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material non-public information that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship.\n\nIn addition, our status as a BHC subjects us to heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the FRB with respect to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries and entities that are or could be viewed as affiliates of ours and, under the Volcker Rule, transactions between us and covered funds.\n\nWe have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be adversely affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Additionally, our One Goldman Sachs initiative aims to increase collaboration among our businesses, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.\n\nGovernmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to compensation, our business practices, our past actions and other matters remains at high levels. Political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions has in the past and may in the future result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage, as well as adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government officials. Press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing (including, in some cases, press coverage and public statements that do not directly involve us) often result in some type of investigation by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits.",

        "page_content": "Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. Governmental authorities may also be more likely to pursue criminal or other actions, including seeking admissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas, in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent a company is viewed as having previously engaged in criminal, regulatory or other misconduct. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\n\nThe financial services industry generally and our businesses in particular have been subject to negative publicity. Our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel, whether or not accurate or true, that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations. Postings on these types of forums may also adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other parties that owe us money, securities or other assets and increase the chance that they will not perform their obligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their use of our services. The speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify risks relating to negative publicity.\n\nSubstantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\n\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about certain of our legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations. We have seen legal claims by consumers and clients increase in a market downturn and employment-related claims increase following periods in which we have reduced our headcount. Additionally, governmental entities have been plaintiffs and are parties in certain of our legal proceedings, and we may face future civil or criminal actions or claims by the same or other governmental entities, as well as follow-on civil litigation that is often commenced after regulatory settlements.\n\nSignificant settlements by several large financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, with governmental entities have been publicly announced. The trend of large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions in similar actions, especially where governmental officials have announced that the large settlements will be used as the basis or a template for other settlements. The uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties.\n\nClaims of collusion or anti-competitive conduct have become more common. Civil cases have been brought against financial institutions (including us) alleging bid-rigging, group boycotts or other anti-competitive practices. Antitrust laws generally provide for joint and several liability and treble damages. These claims have resulted in significant settlements in the past and may do so in the future.\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. Violation of these or similar laws and regulations have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in significant monetary penalties. Such violations could also result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.\n\nCertain law enforcement authorities have recently required admissions of wrongdoing, and, in some cases, criminal pleas, as part of the resolutions of matters brought against financial institutions or their employees. See for example, '1MDB-Related Matters' in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Any such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects. Further, as a result of the 1MDB settlement, we are no longer a 'well-known seasoned issuer,' which places limitations on the manner in which we can market our securities.",

For example, sanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals and companies in Russia and Venezuela. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the transactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. We have been in some cases subject to divergent and conflicting laws and regulations across markets, and we are increasingly subject to the risk that the jurisdictions in which we operate may implement laws and regulations that directly conflict with those of another jurisdiction. Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the application of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market, but also on our reputation generally. Further, in some jurisdictions a failure, or alleged failure, to comply with laws and regulations has subjected and may in the future subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions, but also criminal actions and other sanctions. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.\n\nWhile business and other practices throughout the world differ, our principal entities are subject in their operations worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, hiring practices and money laundering, as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the FCPA, the BSA and the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our operations, employees, clients and consumers, as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation. See for example, '1MDB-Related Matters' in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition, there have been a number of highly publicized cases around the world, involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry, and we have had and may in the future have employee misconduct. This misconduct has included and may also in the future include intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, rules or procedures or misappropriation of funds and the theft of proprietary information, including proprietary software. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be effective in all cases, as reflected by the settlements relating to 1MDB.\n\nThe application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for Group Inc.'s security holders.\n\nAs described in 'Business - Regulation - Banking Supervision and Regulation - Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC,' if the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, the rights of Group Inc.'s creditors would be determined under OLA, and substantial differences exist in the rights of creditors between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our debtholders.\n\nThe FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under OLA to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that would, among other things, impose losses on shareholders, debtholders and other creditors of the top-tier BHC (in our case, Group Inc.), while the BHC's subsidiaries may continue to operate. It is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under OLA, in which Group Inc. would be the only entity to enter resolution proceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank and other operating entities would not enter resolution proceedings), would result in greater losses to Group Inc.'s security holders (including holders of our fixed rate, floating rate and indexed debt securities), than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy, such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for Group Inc. and certain of its material subsidiaries.",

In that case, Group Inc.'s security holders would face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.'s subsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, holders of Group Inc.'s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.'s other debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its right, described above, to disregard the priority of creditor claims.\n\nOLA also provides the FDIC with authority to cause creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to such losses, and amounts owed to the U.S. government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors, including senior creditors.\n\nIn addition, under OLA, claims of creditors (including debtholders) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which Group Inc.'s assets are transferred. If such a securities-for-claims exchange were implemented, there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged. While the FDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible.\n\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and the E.U., have implemented resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Such 'bail-in' powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank of England requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material U.K. subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the Bank of England to exercise such 'bail-in' powers in certain circumstances. If the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is 'bailed in,' Group Inc.'s claims on its subsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries' third-party creditors or written down. U.S. regulators are considering and non-U.S. authorities have adopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the top-tier BHC and, ultimately, to security holders of the top-tier BHC in the event of failure.\n\n## The application of Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.'s security holders.\n\nIn our resolution plan, Group Inc. would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry strategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries, including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness, the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans. If this strategy were successful, creditors of some or all of Group Inc.'s major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.'s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses.\n\nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed Funding IHC. In exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest, Group Inc. transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its GCLA to Funding IHC, and agreed to transfer additional GCLA above prescribed thresholds.",

        "page_content": "We also put in place a Capital and Liquidity Support Agreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Funding IHC and our major subsidiaries. Under the CLSA, Funding IHC has provided Group Inc. with a committed line of credit that allows Group Inc. to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash needs during the ordinary course of business. In addition, if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent, (i) the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii) all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to Group Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC or their maturities will be extended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding IHC, and (iv) Funding IHC will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc.'s and Funding IHC's obligations under the CLSA are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. Such actions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc.'s liquidity. As a result, during a period of severe stress, Group Inc. might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the CLSA and related security agreement had not been implemented.\n\nIf Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy were successful, Group Inc.'s security holders could face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.'s major subsidiaries would incur no losses because those subsidiaries would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. As part of the strategy, Group Inc. could also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries' derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross-default and early termination rights would be stayed under the ISDA Protocols, as applicable, which would result in holders of Group Inc.'s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.'s other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations. It is also possible that holders of Group Inc.'s eligible long-term debt and other debt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly situated creditors of Group Inc.'s major subsidiaries.\n\nIf Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy were not successful, Group Inc.'s financial condition would be adversely impacted and Group Inc.'s security holders, including debtholders, may as a consequence be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented. In all cases, any payments to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk.\n\nAs a result of our recovery and resolution planning processes, including incorporating feedback from our regulators, we may incur increased operational, funding or other costs and face limitations on our ability to structure our internal organization or engage in internal or external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient.\n\nOur commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs.\n\nAs part of our commodities business, we purchase and sell certain physical commodities, arrange for their storage and transport, and engage in market making of commodities. The commodities involved in these activities may include crude oil, refined oil products, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, electric power, agricultural products, metals (base and precious), minerals (including unenriched uranium), emission credits, coal, freight and related products and indices.\n\nWe make investments in and finance entities that engage in the production, storage and transportation of numerous commodities, including many of the commodities referenced above.\n\nThese activities subject us and/or the entities in which we invest to extensive and evolving federal, state and local energy, environmental, antitrust and other governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including environmental laws and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste management, transportation of hazardous substances, natural resources, site remediation and health and safety. Additionally, rising climate change concerns have led to additional regulation that could increase the operating costs and adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments.\n\nThere may be substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commoditiesrelated activities and investments. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require significant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring, renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses.",

In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part, including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store commodities, could expose us to costs or losses. Also, while we seek to insure against potential risks, we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses.\n\nThe occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with clients, may impair our operations or financial results and may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm.\n\nWe may also be required to divest or discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or legal reasons or due to the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy in response to climate change.\n\n## Competition\n\n## Our results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base.\n\nOur client base is not the same as that of our major competitors. Our businesses may have a higher or lower percentage of clients in certain industries or markets than some or all of our competitors. Therefore, unfavorable industry developments or market conditions affecting certain industries or markets have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our businesses underperforming relative to similar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a higher concentration of clients in such industries or markets. For example, our market-making businesses have a higher percentage of clients with actively managed assets than some of our competitors and such clients have in the past and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility.\n\nCorrespondingly, favorable or simply less adverse developments or market conditions involving industries or markets in a business where we have a lower concentration of clients in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher concentration of clients in such industry or market. For example, we have a smaller corporate client base in our market-making businesses than some of our peers and therefore those competitors may benefit more from increased activity by corporate clients. Similarly, we have not historically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the same extent as other financial institutions, which has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equities execution.\n\n## The financial services industry is highly competitive.\n\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price. There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. This has hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to expand.\n\nGovernments and regulators have adopted regulations, imposed taxes, adopted compensation restrictions or otherwise put forward various proposals that have impacted or may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage. These or other similar rules, many of which do not apply to all our U.S. or non-U.S. competitors, could impact our ability to compete effectively.\n\nPricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and other assignments, in response to competitive pressure we have experienced, we have extended and priced credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take.",

        "page_content": "The financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a significant volume of transactions occur among a limited number of members of that industry. Many transactions are syndicated to other financial institutions and financial institutions are often counterparties in transactions. This has led to claims by other market participants and regulators that such institutions have colluded in order to manipulate markets or market prices, including allegations that antitrust laws have been violated. While we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and prevent such activities, allegations of such activities, particularly by regulators, can have a negative reputational impact and can subject us to large fines and settlements, and potentially significant penalties, including treble damages.\n\n## The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading technologies and cryptocurrencies, has increased competition.\n\nTechnology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue. Some of these alternative trading systems compete with us, particularly our exchange-based market-making activities, and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased use by our clients of low-cost electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure.\n\nWe have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return, particularly given the generally lower commissions arising from electronic trades.\n\nIn addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies, including distributed ledgers, such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain, have required us to invest resources to adapt our existing products and services, and we expect to continue to make such investments, which could be material. The adoption and evolution of such new technologies may also increase our compliance and regulatory costs. Further, technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that do not require intermediation could also significantly disrupt payments processing and other financial services. Regulatory limitations on our involvement in products and platforms involving technologies such as cryptocurrencies may not apply equally or in some cases at all to certain of our competitors. We may not be as timely or successful in developing or integrating, or even able to develop or integrate, new products and technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, into our existing products and services, adapting to changes in consumer preferences or achieving market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could affect our ability to attract or retain clients, cause us to lose market share or result in service disruptions and in turn reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect us.\n\n## Our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.\n\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled people; therefore, our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include the level and composition of our compensation and benefits, and our reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly hiring, training and promoting qualified employees. As a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employees is in the form of year-end discretionary compensation, a significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equity-related awards, declines in our profitability, or in the outlook for our future profitability, as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms, can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees.",

        "page_content": "Competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry, including the technology industry, for qualified employees has often been intense. We have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees to address the demands of, expanding consumer-oriented businesses and our technology initiatives. This is also the case in emerging and growth markets, where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region.\n\nChanges in law or regulation in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect taxes on our employees' income, or the amount or composition of compensation, may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in those jurisdictions.\n\nAs described further in 'Business - Regulation Compensation Practices' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, our compensation practices are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB. As a large global financial and banking institution, we are subject to limitations on compensation practices (which may or may not affect the companies with which we compete for talent) by the FRB, the PRA, the FCA, the FDIC and other regulators worldwide. These limitations have shaped our compensation practices, which has in some cases adversely affected our ability to attract and retain talented employees, in particular in relation to companies not subject to these limitations, and future legislation or regulation may have similar adverse effects.\n\nOur operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend, in part, on our overall headcount and the proportion of our employees located in strategic locations. Our future human capital resource requirements and the benefits provided by strategic locations are uncertain, and we may not realize the benefits we anticipate.\n\n## Market Developments and General Business Environment\n\nOur businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, including the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments over the long term and against new variants, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\nWhile financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines that occurred early in the pandemic and global economic conditions generally improved in 2021, certain of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic persisted in 2021, including (i) relatively weak consumer confidence; (ii) low levels of the federal funds rate and yields on U.S. Treasury securities which, at times, were near zero; (iii) ongoing heightened credit risk with regard to industries that have been most severely impacted by the pandemic, including, at times, oil and gas, gaming and lodging, and airlines; (iv) significant interest at times by investors in liquidity products, which generate lower fees, relative to risk assets, resulting in these products comprising a higher share of AUS as compared to the pre-pandemic composition; (v) higher cyber security, information security and operational risks; and (vi) interruptions in the supply chain that have adversely affected many businesses and have contributed to higher rates of inflation.",

Likewise, these adverse developments have in the past and may in the future affect our capital and leverage ratios. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and FRB requirements have in the past limited and may in the future limit capital distributions.\n\nGovernmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The continued success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address future market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity.\n\nCertain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), in particular LIBOR.\n\nThe FCA and the administrator of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies had also issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the USD LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts by December 31, 2021 at the latest. As the transition from LIBOR is ongoing, there continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the transition on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Similar developments have occurred with respect to other IBORs.\n\nUncertainty regarding IBORs and the taking of discretionary actions or negotiation or implementation of fallback provisions could result in pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, compliance, legal and operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures, as well as systems disruption, model disruption and other business continuity issues. In addition, uncertainty relating to IBORs could result in increased capital requirements for us given potential low transaction volumes, a lack of liquidity or limited observability for exposures linked to IBORs or any emerging successor rates and operational incidents associated with changes in and the discontinuance of IBORs.\n\nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments that define IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have developed over time and have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. Once a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate or benchmark to be selected. As a result, for the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings, there continues to be considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of designated rates in contracts and financial instruments or such designated rates ceasing to be acceptable reference rates. This uncertainty could ultimately result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and financial instruments. For LIBOR settings that ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 2021, discretionary actions taken in connection with the implementation of fallback provisions could also result in client disputes and litigation particularly for derivatives and other synthetic instruments. Although we have adhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, the protocol is applicable to derivatives when both parties adhere to the protocol or otherwise agree for it to apply to their derivatives.",

In the event that the composition of the underlier is significantly changed, by reference to rules governing such underlier or otherwise, the underlier ceases to exist (for example, in the event that a country withdraws from the Euro or links its currency to or delinks its currency from another currency or benchmark, an index or ETF sponsor materially alters the composition of an index or ETF, or stocks in a basket are delisted or become impermissible to be included in the index or ETF), the underlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark or there are legal or regulatory constraints on linking a financial instrument to the underlier, we may experience adverse effects consistent with those described above for IBORs.\n\nWe face enhanced risks as new business initiatives and acquisitions lead us to engage in new activities, operate in new locations, transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to newasset classes and new markets.\n\nAnumber of our recent and planned business initiatives and expansions of existing businesses, including through acquisitions and partnership arrangements, may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base, expose us to new asset classes and new markets, and present us with integration challenges. For example, we continue to transact business and invest in new regions, including a wide range of emerging and growth markets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally.\n\nFurthermore, in a number of our businesses, including where we make markets, invest and lend, we own interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership and operation of, public services, such as airports, toll roads and shipping ports, as well as physical commodities and commodities infrastructure components, both within and outside the U.S.\n\nWe have increased and intend to further increase our consumer-oriented deposit-taking and lending activities. For example, we now issue credit cards to consumers and through our pending acquisition of GreenSky, we intend to expand our offering of point-of-sale financing. To the extent we engage in those and other consumer-oriented activities, we have faced, and would continue to face, additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, increased reputational risk and increased operational risk due to, among other things, higher transaction volumes and significantly increased retention and transmission of consumer and client information. Acquisitions and new products can also expose us to new or different types of risks. For example, providing point-of-sale financing through GreenSky will also subject us to risks relating to retaining and attracting merchants and servicing loans for other banks, as well as potential liability for remediation costs if merchants fail to fulfill their obligations to consumers. We are also subject to additional legal requirements, including with respect to suitability and consumer protection (for example, Regulation Best Interest, fair lending laws and regulations and privacy laws and regulations). Further, identity fraud may increase and credit reporting practices may change in a manner that makes it more difficult for financial institutions, such as us, to evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers.",

Legal, regulatory and reputational risks may also exist in connection with activities and transactions involving new products or markets where there is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different or conflicting regulations depending on the regulator or the jurisdiction involved, particularly where transactions in such products may involve multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe have developed and pursued new business and strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, and expect to continue to do so. If and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute those initiatives, we may incur unanticipated costs and losses, and face other adverse consequences, such as negative reputational effects. In addition, the actual effects of pursuing those initiatives may differ, possibly materially, from the benefits that we expect to realize from them, such as generating additional revenues, achieving expense savings, reducing operational risk exposures or using capital and funding more efficiently. Engaging in new activities exposes us to a variety of risks, including that we may be unable to successfully develop new, competitive, efficient and effective systems and processes, and hire and retain the necessary personnel. Due to our lack of historical experience with unsecured consumer lending, our loan loss assumptions may prove to be incorrect and we may incur losses significantly above those which we originally anticipated in entering the business or in expanding the product offerings for the business.\n\nIn recent years, we have invested, and may continue to invest, more in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level of more consistent revenues. In order to develop and be able to offer consumer financial products that compete effectively, we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and human capital resources in connection with our consumer-oriented activities.

We may face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, counterparties, regulators and others in connection with acquisitions. Integration of acquired businesses is time-consuming and could disrupt our ongoing businesses, produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties, cause us to incur incremental expenses or require incremental financial, management and other resources. It is also possible that an acquisition, once announced, may not close due to the failure to satisfy applicable closing conditions, such as the receipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals.\n\nThere is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be successfully integrated or yield all of the expected positive benefits and synergies in the time frames that we expect, or at all. If we are not able to integrate our acquisitions successfully, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.",

Under the terms of the ground lease, we made a lump sum ground rent payment in June 2007 of $161 million for rent through the term of the lease.\n\nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we have offices consisting of approximately 1.6 million square feet of leased and owned space. Our European headquarters is located in London at Plumtree Court, consisting of approximately 826,000 square feet under a lease which can be terminated in 2039.\n\nIn Asia, Australia and New Zealand, we have offices consisting of approximately 2.6 million square feet, including our offices in India, and regional headquarters in Tokyo and Hong Kong. In India, we have offices with approximately 1.6 million square feet, the majority of which have leases that will expire in 2028.\n\nIn the preceding paragraphs, square footage figures are provided only for properties that are used in the operation of our businesses. We regularly evaluate our space capacity in relation to current and projected headcount. We may incur exit costs in the future if we (i) reduce our space capacity or (ii) commit to, or occupy, new properties in locations in which we operate and dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth. These costs may be material to our operating results in a given period.\n\n## Item 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nWe are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages. We have estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for matters where we have been able to estimate a range and we believe, based on currently available information, that the results of matters where we have not been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be material to our operating results in a given period. Given the range of litigation and investigations presently under way, our litigation expenses may remain high.

(GreenSky).\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nWe generated net earnings of $21.64 billion for 2021, significantly higher compared with $9.46 billion for 2020. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $59.45 for 2021, significantly higher compared with $24.74 for 2020. Return on average common shareholders' equity (ROE) was 23.0% for 2021, compared with 11.1% for 2020. Book value per common share was $284.39 as of December 2021, 20.4% higher compared with December2020.\n\nDuring 2020, we recorded net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $3.42 billion, which reduced diluted EPS by $9.51 and reduced ROE by 3.9 percentage points.\n\nNet revenues were $59.34 billion for 2021, 33% higher than 2020, reflecting higher net revenues across all segments, including significant increases in Asset Management, Investment Banking and Consumer & Wealth Management. Net revenues in Asset Management primarily reflected significantly higher net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments, net revenues in Investment Banking primarily reflected significantly higher net revenues in Financial advisory and Underwriting, and net revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management reflected growth in both Wealth management and Consumer banking net revenues. Net revenues in Global Markets were slightly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Equities, partially offset by lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) compared with a strong prior year.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $357 million for 2021, compared with $3.10 billion for 2020. 2021 included provisions related to portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards, including provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio), largely offset by reserve reductions on wholesale and consumer loans reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment. This followed challenging conditions in the prior year as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to significant provisions in 2020.\n\nOperating expenses were $31.94 billion for 2021, 10% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). In addition, technology expenses and professional fees were significantly higher and transaction based expenses were higher. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments). Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for 2021 was 53.8%, compared with 65.0% for 2020. In 2020, net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio by 7.6 percentage points.",

As of December 2021, our CET1 capital ratio was 14.2% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 14.9% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.\n\nWe announced two strategic acquisitions during 2021, the pending acquisitions of NN Investment Partners in our Asset Management business and GreenSky in our Consumer banking business. We expect these acquisitions to accelerate our strategy to drive more durable returns. The acquisition of NN Investment Partners is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, and the acquisition of GreenSky is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we announced that over the medium-term (approximately 3 years), our target is to achieve (i) ROE within a range of 14% to 16%, (ii) return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (ROTE) within a range of 15% to 17% and (iii) an efficiency ratio of approximately 60%. In addition, we announced that our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis points.\n\n## Business Environment\n\nIn 2021, the global economy continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the distribution of vaccines helped facilitate an increase in global economic activity. Economic activity continued to benefit from ongoing fiscal stimulus from governments and continued accommodative monetary policy from global central banks. In the second half of the year, the growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside supply chain complications, contributed to inflationary pressures. Late in the year, the surge in Omicron cases sparked renewed concerns globally, contributing to increased market volatility and increased pressures on labor supply. This may result in a negative impact on economic activity.\n\nDespite broad improvements in the overall economy since the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains on the pace of the recovery going forward, reflecting concerns about virus resurgence from the Omicron variant and other possible variants and related concerns regarding vaccine distribution, efficacy and hesitancy, as well as concerns relating to inflation, supply chain complications and geopolitical risks. See 'Results of Operations - Segment Assets and Operating Results - Segment Operating Results' for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair Value Hierarchy. Trading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio's net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.\n\nThe fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.6% as of December 2021 and 2.3% as of December 2020, of our total assets. See Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include:\n\n- % Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/ or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument;",

Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.\n\nPrice Verification. All financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include:\n\n- % Trade Comparison. Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations.\n- % External Price Comparison. Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, IHS Markit, Bloomberg, IDC, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.\n- % Calibration to Market Comparables. Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components.\n- % Relative Value Analyses. Market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another.\n- % Collateral Analyses. Margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations.\n- % Execution of Trades. Where appropriate, marketmaking desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels.\n- % Backtesting. Valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales.\n\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements.\n\nReview of Net Revenues. Independent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified.\n\nReview of Valuation Models. Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See 'Risk Management - Model Risk Management' for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nWe estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. To determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. We apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower's capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk.\n\nOur estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within our independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of December 2021 (which was primarily weighted towards the baseline economic scenario) to the expected credit losses under a 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse macroeconomic model assumes an emergence of new vaccine-resistant strains of COVID-19 resulting in a resurgence of infections, an economic contraction, high inflation rates in the initial quarters, gradually climbing unemployment rates, decline in GDP growth rates and dislocations in the economy due to shortages in the supply of some goods and services. A 100% weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate $1.3 billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of December 2021. This hypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential adjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes.\n\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The estimated carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders' equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders' equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, our performance or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets.\n\nWe also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\n\nIn accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. As of December 2021, our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.16 billion. We use estimates to recognize current and deferred income taxes in the U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax laws in these jurisdictions are complex and can be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers and taxing authorities. Disputes may arise over these interpretations and can be settled by audit, administrative appeals or judicial proceedings. Our interpretations are reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently available, tax examination experience and the opinions of legal counsel, among other factors. We recognize deferred taxes based on the amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. As of December 2021, we had $6.32 billion of deferred tax assets with a related valuation allowance of $895 million. Our estimate for deferred taxes includes estimates for future taxable earnings, including the level and character of those earnings, and various tax planning strategies. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments\n\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about Recent Accounting Developments.",

The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions. See 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations.

Tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. ROTE is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by average monthly tangible common shareholders' equity. We believe that tangible common shareholders' equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy and that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally. Tangible common shareholders' equity and ROTE are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOperating Environment. During 2021, a general recovery of the global economy, continued monetary and fiscal support from central banks and governments and accelerating vaccine distribution provided a favorable market backdrop. These factors contributed to generally higher global equity prices and tighter credit spreads compared with the end of 2020. In addition, marketmaking activities reflected strong client activity levels, although activity declined from a very strong prior year which reflected heightened volatility and significant market dislocations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and investment banking activity levels across mergers and acquisitions and underwriting were elevated.\n\nIf concerns about the economic outlook, including those on inflation and supply chain issues, grow or the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are ineffective (including due to new variants or complications with vaccine distribution, efficacy and hesitancy), it may lead to a decline in global equity markets, a decline in investment banking activity levels, and a continued decline in market-making activity levels, and net revenues and the provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See 'Segment Assets and Operating Results - Segment Operating Results' for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $59.34 billion for 2021, 33% higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher other principal transactions revenues, investment banking revenues and net interest income, and higher investment management revenues.\n\nNon-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $14.17 billion for 2021, 55% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher revenues in financial advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industrywide initial public offerings activity, and in debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity.\n\nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $8.06 billion for 2021, 16% higher than 2020, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the impact of higher average AUS, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. In addition, incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting.\n\nCommissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.62 billion for 2021, slightly higher than 2020.\n\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $15.35 billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020, as significantly lower revenues in interest rate products and credit products were largely offset by significantly higher revenues in equity products (primarily in derivatives) and commodities, and improved results in mortgages.\n\nOther principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $11.67 billion for 2021, compared with $4.65 billion for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities and in debt instruments, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in 2020.\n\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $6.47 billion for 2021, 36% higher than 2020, reflecting a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, deposits and long-term borrowings, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. The decrease in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements and trading assets, both reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances for loans. See 'Supplemental Financial Information - Statistical Disclosures - Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity' for further information about our sources of net interest income.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Provision for Credit Losses\n\nProvision for credit losses consists of provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the provision for credit losses.\n\nThe table below presents our provision for credit losses.\n\n|                             | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions               | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Provision for credit losses | $357                  | $3,098                | $1,065                |\n\n2021 versus 2020. Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $357 million for 2021, compared with $3.10 billion for 2020. 2021 included provisions related to portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards, including approximately $185 million of provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio), largely offset by reserve reductions on wholesale and consumer loans reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment. This followed challenging conditions in the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to significant provisions in 2020.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOur operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues net of provision for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment.\n\nThe table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount.\n\n|                               | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions                 | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Compensation and benefits     | $17,719               | $13,309               | $12,353               |\n| Transaction based             | 4,710                 | 4,141                 | 3,513                 |\n| Market development            | 553                   | 401                   | 739                   |\n| Communications and technology | 1,573                 | 1,347                 | 1,167                 |\n| Depreciation and amortization | 2,015                 | 1,902                 | 1,704                 |\n| Occupancy                     | 981                   | 960                   | 1,029                 |\n| Professional fees             | 1,648                 | 1,306                 | 1,316                 |\n| Other expenses                | 2,739                 | 5,617                 | 3,077                 |\n| Total operating expenses      | $31,938               | $28,983               | $24,898               |\n| Headcount at period-end       | 43,900                | 40,500                | 38,300                |\n\n2021 versus 2020. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $31.94 billion for 2021, 10% higher than 2020. Our efficiency ratio for 2021 was 53.8%, compared with 65.0% for 2020. In 2020, net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio by 7.6 percentage points.\n\nThe increase in operating expenses compared with 2020 primarily reflected significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). In addition, technology expenses and professional fees were significantly higher and transaction based expenses were higher. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments).\n\nNet provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2021 were $534 million compared with $3.42 billion for 2020.\n\nCharitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives were approximately $250 million for 2021.\n\nAs of December 2021, headcount increased 8% compared with December 2020, reflecting investments in new business initiatives and an increase in technology professionals.\n\n## Provision for Taxes\n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2021 was 20.0%, down from the full year income tax rate of 24.2% for 2020, primarily due to a decrease in provisions for non-deductible litigation, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits in 2021 compared with 2020.\n\nIn March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Rescue Plan) was signed into law. The Rescue Plan is a $1.9 trillion stimulus package enacted to help address the economic and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Rescue Plan includes a repeal of a provision under which U.S. affiliated groups could elect a worldwide allocation of interest expense for foreign tax credit limitation purposes for one year beginning in January 2021. Additionally, beginning in 2027, the limitation on corporate tax deductions for compensation payable to the CEO, CFO and the top three highest paid employees will be expanded to include the next five highest paid employees. The legislation did not have a material impact on our 2021 annual effective tax rate and is not expected to have a material impact on our 2022 annual effective tax rate.\n\nIn April 2021, the New York State (NYS) FY 2022 budget was enacted. The legislation temporarily increased the NYS corporate income tax rate from 6.5% to 7.25% for calendar years 2021 through 2023. The legislation did not have a material impact on our 2021 annual effective tax rate and is not expected to have a material impact on our 2022 annual effective tax rate.",

The Finance (No. 2) Bill 2021-22, issued in November 2021, includes a five percent reduction in the U.K. bank surcharge tax rate, effective from April 2023. The bank surcharge is currently applicable to certain of our U.K. subsidiaries and branches, including Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB). Following Royal Assent, the associated impact of any change to the bank surcharge on U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, depending on the operating results for the quarter during which this legislation is enacted.\n\nWe expect our tax rate for 2022 to be between 20% and 21%, excluding the impact of income tax benefits on employee share-based awards and any potential changes in current income tax rates.\n\n## Segment Assets and Operating Results\n\nSegment Assets.

The allocation of assets includes allocation of GCLA (which consists of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash), which is generally included within cash and cash equivalents, collateralized agreements and trading assets on our balance sheet. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating these assets. See 'Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management' for further information about our GCLA.\n\n## Segment Operating Results.

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOperating Environment. During 2021, Investment Banking operated in an environment characterized by strong industry-wide activity. In mergers and acquisitions, industry-wide completed and announced volumes were at high levels, reflecting supportive market conditions and strong CEO confidence. In underwriting, industry-wide activity levels reflected continued strength in equity underwriting volumes, including strong initial public offerings activity, and solid debt underwriting volumes, including elevated leveraged finance activity.\n\nIn the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate, and industry-wide mergers and acquisitions volumes decline, or if industry-wide equity and debt underwriting volumes decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten further, net revenues in Investment Banking would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, a deterioration in the creditworthiness of borrowers would negatively impact the provision for credit losses.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Investment Banking were $14.88 billion for 2021, 58% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Financial advisory and Underwriting.\n\nThe increase in Financial advisory net revenues reflected a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes. The increase in Underwriting net revenues was due to significantly higher net revenues in both Equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and Debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity. Corporate lending net revenues were significantly higher, primarily reflecting net gains from lending activities compared with net losses in the prior year, and significantly higher net interest income.\n\nProvision for credit losses was a net benefit of $298 million for 2021, compared with net provisions of $1.62 billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the current year reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating expenses were $6.71 billion for 2021, 9% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance), partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Pre-tax earnings were $8.47 billion for 2021, compared with $1.67 billion for 2020. ROE was 64.8% for 2021, compared with 10.5% for 2020 (which included the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings that reduced ROE by 11.5 percentage points).\n\nAs of December 2021, our investment banking transaction backlog increased significantly compared with December 2020, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential financial advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (particularly from leveraged finance transactions), and higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions.\n\nOur backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time. In addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur.\n\n## Global Markets\n\nOur Global Markets segment consists of:\n\nFICC.

Commodity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, physical commodities, involving crude oil and petroleum products, natural gas, agricultural, base, precious and other metals, electricity, including renewable power, environmental products and other commodity products.\n\nFor further information about market-making activities, see 'Market-Making Activities' below.\n\n- % FICC financing. Includes providing financing to our clients through warehouse loans backed by mortgages (including residential and commercial mortgage loans), corporate loans and consumer loans (including auto loans and private student loans). We also provide financing to clients through structured credit, asset-backed lending, and through securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements).\n\nEquities. Equities generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities.\n\n- % Equities intermediation. We make markets in equity securities and equity-related products, including ETFs, convertible securities, options, futures and OTC derivative instruments. We also structure and make markets in derivatives on indices, industry sectors, financial measures and individual company stocks. Our exchange-based market-making activities include making markets in stocks and ETFs, futures and options on major exchanges worldwide. In addition, we generate commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as OTC transactions. For further information about marketmaking activities, see 'Market-Making Activities' below.\n- % Equities financing. Includes prime brokerage and other equities financing activities, including securities lending, margin lending and swaps. We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. We provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients' short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in broker-to-broker securities lending and third-party agency lending activities. We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. In addition, we execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices.\n\n## Market-Making Activities\n\nAs a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOur results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, marketmaking inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations.\n\nThe amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.\n\nIn general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/ offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions.",

See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for net interest income by segment.\n- % The primary driver of net revenues for FICC intermediation was client activity.\n\nOperating Environment. During 2021, Global Markets operated in an environment characterized by continued economic recovery and continued monetary and fiscal support from central banks and governments, which contributed to strong client activity levels, although activity declined from a very strong prior year which reflected heightened volatility and significant market dislocations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, global equity prices were generally higher compared with the end of 2020, as the S&P 500 Index increased by 27% and the MSCI World Index increased by 17%. Market volatility continued to moderate from elevated levels last year, as the average daily VIX was 33% lower than 2020. If macroeconomic conditions lead to a continued decline in activity levels or continued decline in volatility, net revenues in Global Markets would likely be negatively impacted.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Global Markets were $22.08 billion for 2021, 4% higher than 2020.\n\nNet revenues in FICC were $10.58 billion, 9% lower than 2020, due to lower net revenues in FICC intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products and credit products and slightly lower net revenues in currencies, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in mortgages and higher net revenues in commodities. Net revenues in FICC financing were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from mortgage lending, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues from resale agreements.\n\nThe decrease in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected strong but significantly lower client activity compared with very strong activity levels in the prior year due to high volatility amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory compared with challenging conditions in the prior year. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2020 results:\n\n- % Net revenues in interest rate products primarily reflected lower client activity.\n- % Net revenues in credit products and currencies reflected lower client activity, partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory.\n- % Net revenues in mortgages reflected the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory.\n- % Net revenues in commodities primarily reflected higher client activity.",

Pre-tax earnings were $9.06 billion, 12% higher than 2020. ROE was 15.3% for 2021, compared with 14.1% for 2020 (which included the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings that reduced ROE by 4.0 percentage points).\n\n## Asset Management\n\nWe manage client assets across a broad range of investment strategies and asset classes for a diverse set of institutional clients and a network of third-party distributors around the world, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. We provide investment solutions including those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers, as well as those managed by third-party managers. We offer our investment solutions in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other commingled vehicles. These solutions begin with identifying clients' objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization.\n\nIn addition to managing client assets, we invest in alternative investments across a range of asset classes that seek to deliver long-term accretive risk-adjusted returns. Our investing activities, which are typically longer term, include investments in corporate equity, credit, real estate and infrastructure assets.\n\nAsset Management generates revenues from the following:\n\n- % Management and other fees. The majority of revenues in management and other fees consists of asset-based fees on client assets that we manage. For further information about AUS, see 'Assets Under Supervision' below. The fees that we charge vary by asset class, distribution channel and the types of services provided, and are affected by investment performance, as well as asset inflows and redemptions.\n\n- % Incentive fees. In certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund's or a separately managed account's return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a fund's investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns.\n- % Equity investments. Our alternative investing activities relate to public and private equity investments in corporate, real estate and infrastructure entities.

During 2021, the operating environment for Asset Management improved, as global equity prices were generally higher and credit spreads tightened, amid economic recovery and continued support from central banks and governments globally. If optimism about the economic outlook declines or the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are ineffective, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, widening of credit spreads, and investors transitioning to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or investors withdrawing their assets, and net revenues in Asset Management would likely be negatively impacted.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Asset Management were $14.92 billion for 2021, 87% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments.\n\nThe increase in Equity investments net revenues reflected significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities, driven by company-specific events and improved corporate performance compared with 2020, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in the prior year.\n\nThe increase in Lending and debt investments net revenues reflected net gains from investments in debt instruments compared with net losses in the prior year, and significantly higher net interest income.\n\nIncentive fees were higher, primarily driven by harvesting, and Management and other fees were slightly higher, reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $18 million for 2021, compared with $442 million for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the current year reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating expenses were $5.97 billion for 2021, 16% higher than 2020, primarily due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance), partially offset by lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments). Pre-tax earnings were $8.93 billion for 2021, compared with $2.40 billion for 2020. ROE was 28.0% for 2021, compared with 8.5% for 2020.\n\n## Consumer & Wealth Management\n\nConsumer & Wealth Management helps clients achieve their individual financial goals by providing a broad range of wealth advisory and banking services, including financial planning, investment management, deposit-taking and lending.

During 2021, improved market and economic conditions contributed to a more favorable backdrop for consumer banking and wealth management activities. Global equity prices were generally higher and, in the U.S., unemployment decreased and consumer spending increased compared with 2020, aided by optimism about the economic recovery and continued support from central banks and governments globally. If optimism about the economic outlook declines or the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are ineffective, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, investors favoring asset classes that typically generate lower fees, investors withdrawing their assets and consumers withdrawing their deposits or deterioration in consumer credit, net revenues and the provision for credit losses in Consumer & Wealth Management would likely be negatively impacted.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management were $7.47 billion for 2021, 25% higher than 2020.\n\nNet revenues in Wealth management were $5.98 billion, 25% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher Management and other fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, and significantly higher net revenues in Private banking and lending, primarily reflecting higher loan balances. In addition, Incentive fees were higher, primarily due to harvesting.\n\nNet revenues in Consumer banking were $1.49 billion, 23% higher than 2020, reflecting higher credit card and deposit balances.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $592 million for 2021, 22% lower than 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the current year reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020, partially offset by growth in credit card balances, including approximately $185 million of provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio.\n\nOperating expenses were $6.29 billion for 2021, 28% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). Pre-tax earnings were $584 million for 2021, 73% higher than 2020. ROE was 4.0% for 2021, compared with 2.7% for 2020.",

These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were $3.39 billion as of December 2021 and $1.79 billion as of December 2020. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds' financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets.\n\nOur firmwide management and other fees were $7.57 billion for 2021, $6.67 billion for 2020 and $6.08 billion for 2019. In the first quarter of 2022, we announced that our target is to achieve management and other fees of more than $10 billion (including more than $2billion from alternative AUS) in 2024.\n\nThe table below presents our average effective management fee (which excludes non-asset-based fees) earned on our firmwide AUS.\n\n|                             | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |

Our calculation of non-fee-earning alternative investments may not be comparable to similar calculations used by other companies.\n\nIn the beginning of 2020, we announced a strategic objective of growing our third-party alternatives business, and established a target of achieving gross inflows of $150 billion for alternative investments by the end of 2024.

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Balance Sheet and Funding Sources\n\n## Balance Sheet Management\n\nOne of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See 'Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - Capital Management' for information about our capital management process.\n\nAlthough our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end and year-end dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.\n\nIn order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses.\n\nBalance Sheet Planning. Weprepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are:\n\n- % To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements;\n- % To allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital levels, and key metrics; and\n- % To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities.\n\nTreasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage.\n\nOur consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee. See 'Risk Management - Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for an overview of our risk management structure.\n\nBalance Sheet Limits. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions.\n\nMonitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We attribute assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.\n\nScenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of CCAR and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See 'Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - Capital Management' for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover shortand long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.",

As of December 2021, the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter and year resulted from higher levels of our and our clients' activities at the end of the period.\n\nThe level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as certain government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities.\n\nThe table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios.\n\n|                                | As of December   | As of December   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                  | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Total assets                   | $1,463,988       | $1,163,028       |\n| Unsecured long-term borrowings | $ 254,092        | $ 213,481        |\n| Total shareholders' equity     | $ 109,926        | $ 95,932         |\n| Leverage ratio                 | 13.3x            | 12.1x            |\n| Debt-to-equity ratio           | 2.3x             | 2.2x             |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % The leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders' equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt we use to finance assets.

Tangible common shareholders' equity is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n- % Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding and restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements and not subject to performance or market conditions (collectively, basic shares) of 348.9 million as of December 2021 and 358.8 million as of December 2020. We believe that tangible book value per common share (tangible common shareholders' equity divided by basic shares) is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.",

We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs.\n\nDeposits. Our deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. We raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, from private bank clients, consumers, transaction banking clients, other institutional clients, and through internal and third-party broker-dealers. Substantially all of our deposits are raised through GS Bank USA and GSIB. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits, including a maturity profile of our time deposits.\n\nSecured Funding. We fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our collateralized financings, including its maturity profile. We may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and pre-funding residual risk through our GCLA.\n\nWe seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.\n\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage and other assetbacked loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities.\n\nWe also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Our outstanding borrowings against the Federal Home Loan Bank were $100 million as of December 2021 and we had no outstanding borrowings as of December 2020. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. However, we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing.\n\nUnsecured Short-Term Borrowings. A significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and non-U.S. hybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Group Inc. does not issue debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings.",

Unsecured longterm borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings. We issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.\n\nThe table below presents our quarterly unsecured long-term borrowings maturity profile.\n\n| $ in millions       | First Quarter   | Second Quarter   | Third Quarter   | Fourth Quarter   | Total    |\n|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------|\n| As of December 2021 |                 |                  |                 |                  |          |\n| 2023                | $15,373         | $7,271           | $8,939          | $11,628          | $ 43,211 |\n| 2024                | $ 8,622         | $8,948           | $8,869          | $ 7,297          | 33,736   |\n| 2025                | $ 6,855         | $9,732           | $5,671          | $ 6,545          | 28,803   |\n| 2026                | $ 6,174         | $3,773           | $3,485          | $ 8,725          | 22,157   |\n| 2027 - thereafter   |                 |                  |                 |                  | 126,185  |\n| Total               |                 |                  |                 |                  | $254,092 |\n\nThe weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of December 2021 was approximately seven years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly or annual time horizon. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings. We issued approximately $60 billion of benchmark debt during 2021 to support the growth in our total assets amid client demand and attractive return opportunities. We intend to issue significantly less benchmark debt in 2022 compared to our benchmark debt issuance in 2021, though actual issuances may differ due to business needs and market opportunities.\n\nShareholders' Equity. Shareholders' equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders' equity.\n\n## Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\n\nCapital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions.\n\n## Capital Management\n\nWedetermine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets.\n\nWe manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels.\n\nWe principally manage the level and composition of our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock.\n\nWe may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Process. As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.\n\nOur capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.\n\nOur stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in 'Business - Available Information' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\n\nAs required by the FRB's CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB's review is to ensure that we have a robust, forwardlooking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The FRB determines the SCB applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. The SCB under the Standardized approach is calculated as (i) the difference between our starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).\n\nWe submitted our 2021 CCAR capital plan in April 2021 and published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2021. See 'Business - Available Information' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. Based on our 2021 CCAR submission, the FRB reduced our SCB from 6.6% to 6.4%, resulting in a Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement of 13.4% for the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022. See 'Share Repurchase Program' for further information about common stock repurchases and dividends.\n\nGS Bank USA has its own capital planning process and, starting in 2022, will be required to submit its annual stress test results to the FRB. GSI, GSIB and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of their respective regulators.\n\nContingency Capital Plan. As part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders.\n\nCapital Attribution. We assess each of our businesses' capital usage based on our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital constraint is based on the results of the FRB's annual stress test, which includes the Standardized risk-based capital and leverage ratios.\n\nWe review and make any necessary adjustments to our attributed equity in January each year, to reflect, among other things, the results of our latest CCAR process, as well as projected changes in our balance sheet. On January 1, 2021, our allocation of attributed equity changed (relative to the allocation as of December 2020) as follows: attributed equity increased by approximately $3.7 billion for Asset Management and approximately $0.7 billion for Consumer & Wealth Management, while attributed equity decreased by approximately $2.3 billion for Global Markets and approximately $2.1 billion for Investment Banking. On January 1, 2022, our allocation of attributed equity changed (relative to the allocation as of December 2021) as follows: attributed equity increased by approximately $1.0 billion for Consumer & Wealth Management and approximately $0.5 billion for Investment Banking, while attributed equity decreased by approximately $0.8 billion for Global Markets and approximately $0.7 billion for Asset Management. See 'Segment Assets and Operating Results - Segment Operating Results' for information about our average quarterly attributed equity by segment.\n\nShare Repurchase Program. We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) approved an increase in our common stock dividend from $1.25 to $2.00 per share. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we returned a total of $1.20 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and approximately $700 million in common stock dividends. We currently expect our common stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2022 to be at or around the levels of common stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment of capital for our clients where returns are attractive and return any excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nAs of December 2021, the remaining share authorization under our existing repurchase program was 34.4 million shares. See 'Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities' in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process.\n\nResolution Capital Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, GSBE, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.\n\nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\n\n## Rating Agency Guidelines\n\nThe credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc.\n\nThe level and composition of our capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See 'Risk Management Liquidity Risk Management - Credit Ratings' for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.\n\n## Consolidated Regulatory Capital\n\nWe are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the Capital Framework, we are an 'Advanced approach' banking organization and have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).\n\nThe capital requirements calculated under the Capital Framework include the capital conservation buffer requirements, which are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under the Standardized Capital Rules), a countercyclical capital buffer (under both Capital Rules) and the G-SIB surcharge (under both Capital Rules). Our G-SIB surcharge is 2.5% for 2021 and 2022 and 3.0% for 2023. Based on financial data for 2021, we are above the threshold for the 3.5% G-SIB surcharge. The earliest this surcharge could be effective is January 2024. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes, and our SCB is likely to change from year to year based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. Our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis points.\n\nSee Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the Capital Framework.\n\n## Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)\n\nWe are also subject to the FRB's TLAC and related requirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC and related requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the FRB and could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments.",

Leverage exposure for the three months ended December 2020 excluded average holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and average deposits at the Federal Reserve as permitted by the FRB under a temporary amendment. This temporary amendment had the effect of increasing the TLAC to leverage exposure ratio and the external long-term debt to leverage ratio. The impact of this temporary amendment was an increase to the TLAC to leverage exposure ratio of 2.4 percentage points and the external long-term debt to leverage exposure ratio of 1.3 percentage points for the three months ended December 2020. The amendment permitting this exclusion expired on April 1, 2021.\n\nSee 'Business - Regulation' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form10-K for further information about TLAC.\n\n## Subsidiary Capital Requirements\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.\n\nBank Subsidiaries. GS Bank USA is our primary U.S. banking subsidiary and GSIB and GSBE are our primary non-U.S. banking subsidiaries. These entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries.\n\nU.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries. GS&Co. is our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary and is subject to regulatory capital requirements, including those imposed by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. In addition, GS&Co. is a registered futures commission merchant and a registered swap dealer with the CFTC, and therefore is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, GS&Co. also became a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC, and therefore became subject to capital requirements for security-based swap dealers which became effective in October 2021. Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC and Rules 1.17 and Part 23 Subpart E of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants' assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the 'Alternative Net Capital Requirement' as permitted by Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nGS&Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule 15c3-1, of $22.18 billion as of December 2021 and $22.38 billion as of December 2020, which exceeded the amount required by $17.74 billion as of December 2021 and $18.45 billion as of December 2020. In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $5 billion and net capital in excess of $1 billion in accordance with Rule 15c3-1. GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $6 billion. As of both December 2021 and December 2020, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements.\n\nNon-U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries. Our principal non-U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include GSI and GSJCL.\n\nGSI, our U.K. broker-dealer, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). GSI is subject to the U.K. capital framework, which is predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital framework prescribed in the amended E.U. Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). These capital regulations are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III).\n\nThe table below presents GSI's risk-based capital requirements.\n\n|                                 | As of December   | As of December   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                 | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Risk-based capital requirements |                  |                  |\n| CET1 capital ratio              | 8.1%             | 8.1%             |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio            | 9.9%             | 10.0%            |\n| Total capital ratio             | 12.4%            | 12.5%            |\n\nIn the table above, the risk-based capital requirements incorporate capital guidance received from the PRA and could change in the future.\n\nThe table below presents information about GSI's riskbased capital ratios.\n\n|                                             | As of December   | As of December   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                               | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Risk-based capital and risk-weighted assets |                  |                  |\n| CET1 capital                                | $ 28,810         | $ 26,962         |\n| Tier 1 capital                              | $ 37,110         | $ 35,262         |\n| Tier 2 capital                              | $ 5,377          | $ 5,377          |\n| Total capital                               | $ 42,487         | $ 40,639         |\n| RWAs                                        | $269,762         | $252,355         |\n| Risk-based capital ratios                   |                  |                  |\n| CET1 capital ratio                          | 10.7%            | 10.7%            |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio                        | 13.8%            | 14.0%            |\n| Total capital ratio                         | 15.7%            | 16.1%            |\n\nIn the table above, the risk-based capital ratios as of December 2021 reflected GSI's profits after foreseeable charges for the three months ended December 2021 (which will not be finalized until verification by GSI's external auditors and approval by GSI's Board of Directors for inclusion in risk-based capital). These profits contributed approximately 16 basis points to the CET1 capital ratio.\n\nGSI is also subject to the leverage ratio framework established by the PRA. This framework sets the minimum leverage ratio requirement at 3.25% that will apply to GSI from January 1, 2023. GSI had a leverage ratio of 4.2% as of December 2021 and 4.7% as of December 2020. The leverage ratio as of December 2021 reflected GSI's profits after foreseeable charges for the three months ended December 2021 (which will not be finalized until verification by GSI's external auditors and approval by GSI's Board of Directors for inclusion in risk-based capital). These profits contributed approximately 7 basis points to the leverage ratio.\n\nGSI is a registered swap dealer with the CFTC and, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, also became a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC. As of December 2021, GSI was subject to and in compliance with applicable capital requirements for swap dealers and security-based swap dealers.\n\nGSI is also subject to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities issued to affiliates. This requirement is subject to a transitional period which began to phase in from January 2019 and became fully effective beginning in January 2022. As of both December 2021 and December 2020, GSI was in compliance with this requirement.\n\nGSJCL, our Japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by Japan's Financial Services Agency. GSJCL and certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate. As of both December 2021 and December 2020, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Regulatory and Other Matters\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. Regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations.\n\nSee 'Business - Regulation' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nReplacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including LIBOR. On January 1, 2022, the publication of all EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD LIBOR) settings along with certain USD LIBOR settings ceased. The publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings will cease after June 2023. The FCA has allowed the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain GBP and JPY LIBOR settings in legacy GBP or JPY LIBORbased derivative contracts through December 2022. The U.S. federal banking agencies' guidance strongly encourages banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR.\n\nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterparties have to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. ISDA confirmed that the FCA's formal announcement in March 2021 fixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR rates and that fallbacks will automatically occur for outstanding derivative contracts that incorporate the relevant terms. In April 2021, the State of New York approved legislation intended to minimize legal and economic uncertainty for contracts that are governed by New York law and have no fallback provisions or have fallback provisions that are based on USD LIBOR by providing a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).\n\nWe have facilitated an orderly transition from non-USD LIBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates for us and our clients and continue to make progress on our transition program as it relates to USD LIBOR.\n\nOur non-USD LIBOR risk exposure was substantially all in connection with derivative contracts. As of December 2021, substantially all of our non-USD LIBORbased derivative contracts were with central clearing counterparties or exchanges which had incorporated fallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in their rulebooks or were under bilateral agreements subject to the IBOR Protocol. The remainder were converted to synthetic rates as permitted by the FCA. The notional amount of derivatives converted to synthetic rates was not material.\n\nOur risk exposure to USD LIBOR is primarily in connection with our derivative contracts and to a lesser extent our unsecured debt, preferred stock and loan portfolio. As of December 2021, the notional amount of our USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts was approximately $10.0 trillion, of which approximately $5.5 trillion will mature after June 2023 based on their contractual terms. A majority of such derivative contracts are with counterparties under bilateral agreements subject to the IBOR Protocol, or with central clearing counterparties or exchanges which have incorporated fallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in their rulebooks and have announced that they plan to convert USD LIBOR contracts to alternative risk-free reference rates. Our benchmark unsecured debt and preferred stock with USD LIBOR exposure was approximately $34.5 billion as of December 2021, of which $29.4 billion will contractually mature after June 2023 or is perpetual and has no stated maturity date. A large portion of such debt and preferred stock represents our fixed-to-floating rate instruments, currently in the fixed-rate period, with call options before the LIBOR exposure begins. We continue to monitor industry and legislative developments as they relate to unsecured debt and preferred stock and will take actions designed to facilitate an orderly transition. In addition, we are also engaging with our clients in order to remediate our loan agreements through bilateral amendments.\n\nWe have also issued debt and deposits linked to SOFR and Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and executed SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities. When appropriate, we continue to execute transactions in the market to reduce our USD LIBOR exposures arising from hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace them with alternative risk-free reference rate exposures.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOur LIBOR transition program continues to make progress with a focus on:\n\n- % Evaluating and monitoring the impacts of USD LIBOR settings across our businesses, including transactions and products;\n- % Ensuring that legacy financial instruments and contracts that continue to be impacted by the transition already contain appropriate fallback language or are being amended, either through bilateral negotiation or using industry-wide tools, such as protocols;\n- % Enhancements to infrastructure (for example, models and systems) to prepare for a smooth transition from USD LIBOR to alternative risk-free reference rates;\n- % Ensuring operational readiness to offer and support various alternative risk-free reference rate products;\n- % Active participation in central bank and sector working groups, including responding to industry consultations; and\n- % Client education and communication.\n\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic. Infection rates in many parts of the world spiked toward the end of 2021 and into early 2022, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant emerged in the fourth quarter and spread rapidly, while the Delta variant also remained a concern. The surge of infections has led to a renewed emphasis globally on safety measures and restrictions, as well as a greater sense of urgency regarding the distribution of vaccines and vaccine boosters, and has created a greater degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for economic growth in 2022.\n\nWe have continued to successfully execute on our BCP strategy since initially activating it in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our priority has been to safeguard our employees and to seek to ensure continuity of business operations on behalf of our clients. Our business continuity response to the COVID-19 pandemic is managed by a central team, which is led by our chief administrative officer and chief medical officer, and includes senior management within Risk and the chief operating officers across all regions and businesses. We remain focused on ensuring that our employees are able to safely work from our offices, where circumstances permit. During 2021, we made substantial progress in facilitating the safe return of employees to our offices and employees in a number of our locations around the world returned to the office to varying degrees. Given that the situation regarding COVID-19 is fluid and varies geographically, our approach to transitioning back to the office is flexible and evolves as the specific conditions and requirements of each location change. For instance, in light of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant late in 2021, we took the step of having the vast majority of employees in the U.S., the U.K. and in some of our other locations work remotely at the outset of 2022.\n\nOur systems and infrastructure have been robust throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling us to conduct our activities without disruption. Communication throughout our organization has remained active during the pandemic and our risk management processes have continued to operate in a rigorous and disciplined manner.\n\nWe maintained high liquidity levels during 2021, as our GCLA averaged $335 billion for the year. We have continued to access our traditional funding sources in the normal course and service our debt and other obligations on a timely basis. See 'Balance Sheet and Funding Sources' and 'Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management' for further information.\n\nAccounting estimates, particularly those made in connection with determining the allowance for credit losses and the fair value of certain level 3 assets, are sensitive to assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Predicting the trajectory of the economic recovery is highly judgmental given the uncertainty as to how the pandemic will evolve, as it will largely depend on the duration of the Omicron wave, the possible emergence of other variants and further progress in the distribution of vaccines and vaccine boosters.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nIn general, the market backdrop continued to be constructive during 2021 and activity levels remained solid. Volatility increased toward the end of the year as a result of the spike in infections, while accelerating inflation, driven by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, and more moderated growth expectations, were key macroeconomic considerations heading into 2022. We continued to deploy our balance sheet to intermediate risk and to support the needs of clients. We have maintained our proactive approach to managing market risk levels, which entails ongoing review and monitoring of exposures and focusing on ways to mitigate risk. As the economic recovery progressed in 2021, credit risk continued to abate from the low point of the pandemic. However, we continue to closely monitor those industries that have been most severely challenged by the pandemic.\n\nWhile the global economy continued on the path to recovery during 2021, it is vulnerable to the risk that the Omicron variant, or other possible variants, could impede the recovery going forward by precipitating adverse economic consequences, such as a softening in consumer and business confidence and spending, a worsening of supply chain constraints, and an intensification of inflationary pressures. If the future effects of the pandemic were to lead to a sustained period of economic weakness, our businesses would be negatively impacted. This would have a negative impact on factors that are important to our operating performance, such as the level of client activity, creditworthiness of counterparties and borrowers, and the amount of our AUS. We will continue to closely monitor the rollout of vaccines across regions, as well as the impact of new variants of the virus, and will take further actions, as necessary, in order to best serve the interests of our employees, clients and counterparties. For further information about the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including:\n\n- % Purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles;\n- % Holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles;\n- % Entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and\n- % Providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties.\n\nWe enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process.\n\nWe also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; and provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes.\n\nThe table below presents where information about our various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K.

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Risk Management\n\nRisks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. Our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or global businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the potential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our reputation. For further information about our risk management processes, see 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management,' and for information about our areas of risk, see 'Liquidity Risk Management,' 'Market Risk Management,' 'Credit Risk Management,' 'Operational Risk Management' and 'Model Risk Management' and 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Overview and Structure of Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people.\n\nGovernance. Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite.\n\nThe Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk, from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the chief legal officer, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair of our Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee and our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement.\n\nThe implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes are overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite.\n\nOur revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital Management, Operations, and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are considered our first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite.\n\nOur independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include Compliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax.\n\nInternal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThe three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line.\n\nProcesses. We maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk reporting and monitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making.\n\n- % Risk Identification and Assessment. We believe that the identification and assessment of our risks is a critical step in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk identification and assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks.\n\nTo effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures.\n\nAn important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See 'Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - Capital Management' for further information.\n\n- % Risk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting. Weapply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, and monitoring these limits.\n\nThe Risk Governance Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties, counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance.\n\n- % Risk Reporting and Monitoring. Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. Our risk reporting and monitoring processes are designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide means for timely escalation. We evaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n- % Risk Decision-Making. Our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks.\n\nWe maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decisionmaking among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. While our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards.\n\n## Structure\n\nUltimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees, councils or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact on our reputation of the transactions and activities that they oversee.\n\nMembership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.\n\nThe chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement Committee. The Management Committee oversees our global activities. It provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. Most members of the Management Committee are also members of other committees. The following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management.",

The Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing all of our financial and nonfinancial risks. As part of such oversight, the committee is responsible for the ongoing review, approval and monitoring of our enterprise risk management framework, as well as our risk limits framework. This committee is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and our chief risk officer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee. The following are the primary committees or councils that report to the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee:\n\n- % Firmwide Risk Council. The Firmwide Risk Council is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of relevant financial risks and related risk limits at the firmwide, business and product levels. This council is co-chaired by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\n- % Firmwide New Activity Committee. The Firmwide New Activity Committee is responsible for reviewing new activities and for establishing a process to identify and review previously approved activities that are significant and that have changed in complexity and/or structure or present different reputational and suitability concerns over time to consider whether these activities remain appropriate. This committee is co-chaired by the controller and chief accounting officer, and our chief administrative officer, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\n- % Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience. To assist the Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee in carrying out its mandate, other risk committees with dedicated oversight for technology-related risks, including cyber security matters, report into the Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee. This committee is co-chaired by our chief administrative officer and the head of Operational Risk, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\n- % Firmwide Conduct Committee. The Firmwide Conduct Committee is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of the frameworks and policies which govern our conduct risks. Conduct risk is the risk that our people fail to act in a manner consistent with our Business Principles and related core values, policies or codes, or applicable laws or regulations, thereby falling short in fulfilling their responsibilities to us, our clients, colleagues, other market participants or the broader community. This committee is chaired by our chief legal officer, who is appointed as chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\n- % Risk Governance Committee. The Risk Governance Committee (through delegated authority from the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee) is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of risk frameworks, policies and parameters related to our core risk management processes, as well as limits, at firmwide, business and product levels.

The Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee is responsible for assessing reputational risks arising from transactions that have been identified as having potential heightened reputational risk pursuant to the criteria established by the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee and as determined by committee leadership. This committee is chaired by our president and chief operating officer, who is appointed as chair by the chief executive officer, and the vice-chairs are our chief legal officer and the former chair of Conflicts Resolution (now a senior advisor to the firm), who are appointed as vice-chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. This committee periodically provides updates to, and receives guidance from, the Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board.\n- % Firmwide Suitability Committee. The Firmwide Suitability Committee is responsible for setting standards and policies for product, transaction and client suitability and providing a forum for consistency across functions, regions and products on suitability assessments. This committee also reviews suitability matters escalated from other committees. This committee is co-chaired by our chief compliance officer, and a co-head of EMEA FICC sales, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee.\n- % Firmwide Investment Policy Committee. The Firmwide Investment Policy Committee periodically reviews our investing and lending activities on a portfolio basis, including review of risk management and controls, and sets business standards and policies for these types of investments. This committee is co-chaired by a co-head of our Asset Management Division, a co-head of our Global Markets Division and our chief risk officer, who are appointed as chairs by our president and chief operating officer and our chief financial officer.\n- % Firmwide Capital Committee. The Firmwide Capital Committee provides approval and oversight of debtrelated transactions, including principal commitments of our capital. This committee aims to ensure that business, reputational and suitability standards for underwritings and capital commitments are maintained on a global basis. This committee is co-chaired by the head of Credit Risk and the head of Americas Leveraged Finance, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\n\n- % Firmwide Commitments Committee. The Firmwide Commitments Committee reviews our underwriting and distribution activities with respect to equity and equityrelated product offerings, and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and business standards are maintained on a global basis. In addition to reviewing specific transactions, this committee periodically conducts general strategic reviews of sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices. This committee is co-chaired by the chief underwriting officer for EMEA, the chief equity underwriting officer for the Americas, a co-chairman of the Global Financial Institutions Group and a co-head of the Industrials Group in our Investment Banking Division, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee.\n\nFirmwide Asset Liability Committee. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews and approves the strategic direction for our financial resources, including capital, liquidity, funding and balance sheet. This committee has oversight responsibility for asset liability management, including interest rate and currency risk, funds transfer pricing, capital allocation and incentives, and credit ratings. This committee makes recommendations as to any adjustments to asset liability management and financial resource allocation in light of current events, risks, exposures, and regulatory requirements and approves related policies. This committee is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and our global treasurer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee.\n\n## Conflicts Management\n\nConflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term 'conflict of interest' does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees.\n\nWe have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee, and other internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAs a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Investment Banking and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. The head of Conflicts Resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who reports to our chief executive officer.\n\nWe regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\n## Climate Risk Management\n\nWe categorize climate risk into physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk is the risk that asset values may decline or operations may be disrupted as a result of changes in the climate, while transition risk is the risk that asset values may decline because of changes in climate policies or changes in the underlying economy due to decarbonization.\n\nAs a global financial institution, climate-related risks manifest in different ways across our businesses and we have continued to make significant enhancements to our climate risk management framework, including steps to further integrate climate into our broader risk management processes. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities Committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and integration into existing risk management processes. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. Senior management within Risk is responsible for the development of our climate risk program.\n\nWe have begun incorporating climate risk into our credit evaluation and underwriting processes for select industries. Climate risk factors are now evaluated as part of transaction due diligence for select loan commitments.\n\nSee 'Business - Sustainability' in Part I, Item 1 and 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for information about our sustainability initiatives, including in relation to climate transition.\n\n## Compliance Risk Management\n\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. Wemonitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\n\n## Capital Risk Management\n\nCapital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient to support our business activities under normal and stressed market conditions or we face capital reductions or RWA increases, including from new or revised rules or changes in interpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable to meet our internal capital targets or external regulatory capital requirements. Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. Accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to maintain an appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Our capital management framework is designed to provide us with the information needed to comprehensively manage risk, and develop and apply projected stress scenarios that capture idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with a goal of holding sufficient capital to remain adequately capitalized even after experiencing a severe stress event. See 'Capital Management and Regulatory Capital' for further information about our capital management process.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nWe have established a comprehensive governance structure to manage and oversee our day-to-day capital management activities and compliance with capital rules and related policies. Our capital management activities are overseen by the Board and its committees. The Board is responsible for approving our annual capital plan and the Risk Committee of the Board approves our capital management policy. In addition, committees and members of senior management are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of our capital adequacy and evaluate current and future regulatory capital requirements, review the results of our capital planning and stress tests processes, and the results of our capital models, review our contingency capital plan, key capital adequacy metrics, including regulatory capital ratios, as well as capital plan metrics, such as the payout ratio, outcomes and findings of calculation testing, and monitor capital risk limits and breaches.\n\nOur process for managing capital risk also includes independent review functions in Risk that, among other things, assess regulatory capital policies and related interpretations, escalate certain interpretations to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, and perform calculation testing to corroborate alignment with applicable capital rules.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firmspecific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. We have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances.\n\nTreasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite.\n\nLiquidity Risk, which is independent of our revenueproducing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Management Principles\n\nWe manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan.\n\nGCLA. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the following principles:\n\n- % The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company's survival;\n- % Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment;\n- % During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and\n- % As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.'s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAsset-Liability Management. Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-liability management includes:\n\n- % Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See 'Balance Sheet and Funding Sources Funding Sources' for further information;\n- % Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See 'Balance Sheet and Funding Sources - Balance Sheet Management' for further information about our balance sheet management process and '- Funding Sources - Secured Funding' for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and\n- % Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.\n\nOur goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders' equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.\n\n## Subsidiary Funding Policies\n\nThe majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings.\n\nOur intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary's funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2021, Group Inc. had $38.08 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $44.44 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.50 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $46.17 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York Statechartered bank; and $4.28 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provides financing, directly or indirectly, in the form of: $95.74 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $41.91 billion) and $17.68 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities as of December 2021. In addition, as of December 2021, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nContingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution.\n\nThe contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress.\n\n## Stress Tests\n\nIn order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a 30-day stress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\nModeled Liquidity Outflow. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements:\n\n- % Severely challenged market environments, which includes low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and\n- % A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade.\n\nThe following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow:\n\n- % Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario;\n- % A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings;\n- % Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding;\n- % No support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and\n- % A combination of contractual outflows and contingent outflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual outflows include, among other things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term deposits and secured funding. Contingent outflows include, among other things, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. See notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about contractual outflows, including Note 11 for collateralized financings, Note 13 for deposits, Note 14 for unsecured long-term borrowings and Note 15 for operating lease payments, and 'Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements' for further information about our various types of off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained.\n\nLong-Term Stress Testing. We utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nResolution Liquidity Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.\n\nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\n\n## Limits\n\nWe use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the limit approval process.\n\nLimits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.\n\n## GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics\n\nGCLA. Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both December 2021 and December 2020 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities.\n\nThe table below presents information about our GCLA.\n\n|                                  | Average for the             | Average for the             | Average for the     | Average for the     |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                  | Three Months Ended December | Three Months Ended December | Year Ended December | Year Ended December |\n| $ in millions                    | 2021                        | 2020                        | 2021                | 2020                |\n| Denomination                     |                             |                             |                     |                     |\n| U.S. dollar                      | $230,720                    | $190,735                    | $217,797            | $181,949            |\n| Non-U.S. dollar                  | 122,401                     | 107,106                     | 116,723             | 101,182             |\n| Total                            | $353,121                    | $297,841                    | $334,520            | $283,131            |\n| Asset Class                      |                             |                             |                     |                     |\n| Overnight cash deposits          | $188,223                    | $108,345                    | $173,000            | $100,489            |\n| U.S. government obligations      | 107,898                     | 125,060                     | 108,260             | 113,531             |\n| U.S. agency obligations          | 13,154                      | 7,059                       | 10,183              | 12,017              |\n| Non-U.S. government obligations  | 43,846                      | 57,377                      | 43,077              | 57,094              |\n| Total                            | $353,121                    | $297,841                    | $334,520            | $283,131            |\n| Entity Type                      |                             |                             |                     |                     |\n| Group Inc. and Funding IHC       | $ 54,489                    | $ 36,737                    | $ 53,205            | $ 41,705            |\n| Major broker-dealer subsidiaries | 107,279                     | 100,891                     | 104,326             | 99,798              |\n| Major bank subsidiaries          | 191,353                     | 160,213                     | 176,989             | 141,628             |\n| Total                            | $353,121                    | $297,841                    | $334,520            | $283,131            |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % The U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of (i) unencumbered U.S. government and agency obligations (including highly liquid U.S. agency mortgage-backed obligations), all of which are eligible as collateral in Federal Reserve open market operations and (ii) certain overnight U.S. dollar cash deposits.\n- % The non-U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of non-U.S. government obligations (only unencumbered German, French, Japanese and U.K. government obligations) and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and its subsidiaries. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOther Unencumbered Assets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $271.65 billion for the three months ended December 2021, $214.06 billion for the three months ended December 2020, $249.32 billion for the year ended December 2021 and $207.60 billion for the year ended December 2020. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA.\n\n## Liquidity Regulatory Framework\n\nAs a BHC, we are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute, short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the market environment will impact our LCR.\n\nThe table below presents information about our average daily LCR.\n\n|                   | Average for the Three Months Ended   | Average for the Three Months Ended   | Average for the Three Months Ended   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| $ in millions     | December 2021                        | September 2021                       | December 2020                        |\n| Total HQLA        | $342,047                             | $344,351                             | $291,393                             |\n| Eligible HQLA     | $248,570                             | $249,915                             | $212,614                             |\n| Net cash outflows | $203,623                             | $196,664                             | $166,551                             |\n| LCR               | 122%                                 | 127%                                 | 128%                                 |\n\nIn October 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that established a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement for large U.S. banking organizations. This rule became effective on July 1, 2021 and requires banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon. The rule also requires disclosure of the ratio on a semi-annual basis and a description of the banking organization's stable funding sources beginning in 2023. Our NSFR as of December 2021 exceeded the minimum requirement.\n\nThe following provides information about our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements:\n\n- % GS Bank USA. GS Bank USA is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. As of December 2021, GS Bank USA's LCR exceeded the minimum requirement. The NSFR requirement described above also applies to GS Bank USA. As of December 2021, GS Bank USA's NSFRexceeded the minimum requirement.\n- % GSI and GSIB. GSI and GSIB are subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities. GSI's and GSIB's average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2021 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSI and GSIB are subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the U.K., which became effective in January 2022. As of December 2021, both GSI's and GSIB's NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement.\n- % GSBE. GSBE is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the European Parliament and Council. GSBE's average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2021 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSBE is subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the E.U., which became effective in June 2021. As of December 2021, GSBE's NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement.\n- % Other Subsidiaries. We monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committee's framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments.\n\nThe implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nWe rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. See 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.",

We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.\n\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nAs a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses.",

Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $105.19 billion to $261.04 billion at the end of 2021, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits, reflecting increases across channels, and net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments and an increase in net lending activities, partially offset by sales and paydowns of investments.\n\nYear Ended December 2020. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $22.30 billion to $155.84 billion at the end of 2020, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities and operating activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits, reflecting increases in consumer, transaction banking and private bank deposits. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected an increase in net purchases of investments, reflecting an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as available-for-sale and an increase in net lending activities. The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected an increase in trading assets, net customer and other receivables and payables, and collateralized transactions (an increase in collateralized agreements, partially offset by an increase in collateralized financings), partially offset by an increase in trading liabilities as a result of our and our clients' activities.\n\nFor an analysis of cash flows for the year ended December 2019, see Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Market Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, investments, loans and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value due to changes in market conditions. We hold such positions primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and therefore, these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. Since these positions are accounted for at fair value, they fluctuate on a daily basis, with the related gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of earnings. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following:\n\n- % Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;\n\n- % Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices;\n- % Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and\n- % Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals.\n\nMarket Risk, which is independent of our revenueproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses.\n\nManagers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenueproducing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures.\n\n## Market Risk Management Process\n\nOur process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management,' as well as the following:\n\n- % Monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures;\n- % Diversifying exposures;\n- % Controlling position sizes; and\n- % Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives.\n\nOur market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Risk Measures\n\nWe produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels.\n\nWe use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, which is used for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions.\n\nValue-at-Risk. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see 'Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures.' We typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks, including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.\n\nWe are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include:\n\n- % VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme;\n- % VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and\n- % Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves.\n\nTo comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa.\n\nGiven its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does not include:\n\n- % Positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and\n- % The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.\n\nWe perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries.\n\nStress Testing. Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\nSensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.\n\nScenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nUnlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).\n\n## Limits\n\nWe use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaRand on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the limit approval process.\n\nMarket Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.\n\nThe table below presents our average daily VaR.\n\n|                        | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions          | 2021                  | 2020                  |\n| Categories             |                       |                       |\n| Interest rates         | $60                   | $71                   |\n| Equity prices          | 43                    | 55                    |\n| Currency rates         | 13                    | 23                    |\n| Commodity prices       | 25                    | 20                    |\n| Diversification effect | (55)                  | (75)                  |\n| Total                  | $ 86                  | $94                   |\n\nOur average daily VaR decreased to $86 million in 2021 from $94 million in 2020, due to lower levels of volatility, partially offset by increased exposures. The total decrease of $8 million was driven by decreases in the equity prices, interest rates and currency rates categories, partially offset by a decrease in the diversification effect and an increase in the commodity prices category.\n\nThe table below presents our period-end VaR.\n\n|                        | As of December   | As of December   |\n|------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions          | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Categories             |                  |                  |\n| Interest rates         | $69              | $60              |\n| Equity prices          | 31               | 50               |\n| Currency rates         | 19               | 11               |\n| Commodity prices       | 30               | 16               |\n| Diversification effect | (58)             | (46)             |\n| Total                  | $ 91             | $91              |\n\nOur period-end VaR was $91 million as of December 2021, unchanged compared with December 2020, reflecting increased exposures, offset by lower levels of volatility. This was driven by increases in the commodity prices, interest rates and currency rates categories, offset by a decrease in the equity prices category and an increase in the diversification effect.\n\nDuring 2021, the firmwide VaR risk limit was not exceeded, raised or reduced, and there were no permanent or temporary changes to the firmwide VaR risk limit. During 2020, the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on 16 occasions (all of which occurred during the first half of 2020), primarily due to higher levels of volatility. There were no permanent changes to the firmwide VaR risk limit during this period. However, there were temporary increases to the firmwide VaR risk limit as a result of the market environment in 2020.\n\nThe table below presents our high and low VaR.\n\n|                  | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                  | 2021                  | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2020                  |\n| $ in millions    | High                  | Low                   | High                  | Low                   |\n| Categories       |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| Interest rates   | $ 74                  | $49                   | $120                  | $46                   |\n| Equity prices    | $ 71                  | $30                   | $116                  | $23                   |\n| Currency rates   | $ 20                  | $ 8                   | $ 53                  | $ 8                   |\n| Commodity prices | $ 45                  | $14                   | $ 54                  | $ 9                   |\n| Firmwide         |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| VaR              | $105                  | $69                   | $195                  | $58                   |\n\nThe chart below presents our daily VaR for 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 120   |                     |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| 60 90 |                     |\n| 0 30  | Fourth Quarter 2021 |",

Net losses incurred on a single day for such positions exceeded our 95% one-day VaR (i.e., a VaR exception) on one occasion during 2021 and on two occasions during 2020.\n\nDuring periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer VaR exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. In periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more VaR exceptions. The daily net revenues for positions included in VaR used to determine VaR exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature.\n\n## Sensitivity Measures\n\nCertain portfolios and individual positions are not included in VaR because VaR is not the most appropriate risk measure. Other sensitivity measures we use to analyze market risk are described below.\n\n10% Sensitivity Measures. The table below presents our market risk by asset category for positions accounted for at fair value, that are not included in VaR.\n\n|               | As of December   | As of December   |\n|---------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Equity        | $1,953           | $1,854           |\n| Debt          | 2,244            | 2,516            |\n| Total         | $4,197           | $4,370           |\n\nIn the table above:\n\n- % The market risk of these positions is determined by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues of a 10%decline in the value of these positions.\n- % Equity positions relate to private and restricted public equity securities, including interests in funds that invest in corporate equities and real estate and interests in hedge funds.\n- % Debt positions include interests in funds that invest in corporate mezzanine and senior debt instruments, loans backed by commercial and residential real estate, corporate bank loans and other corporate debt, including acquired portfolios of distressed loans.\n- % Funded equity and debt positions are included in our consolidated balance sheets in investments and loans. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about investments and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans.\n- % These measures do not reflect the diversification effect across asset categories or across other market risk measures.\n\nCredit and Funding Spread Sensitivity on Derivatives and Financial Liabilities. VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty credit spreads, our own credit spreads and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of $1 million as of December 2021 and $3 million as of December 2020. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $33 million as of December 2021 and $22 million as of December 2020. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken.\n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. Loans accounted for at amortized cost were $139.93 billion as of December 2021 and $99.69 billion as of December 2020, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $1.07 billion as of December 2021 and $737 million as of December 2020 of additional interest income over a twelvemonth period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs to fund such loans. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans accounted for at amortized cost.\n\n## Other Market Risk Considerations\n\nWe make investments in securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity or under the equity method which are included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets.

Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our revenueproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk.\n\n## Credit Risk Management Process\n\nOur process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management,' as well as the following:\n\n- % Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations;\n- % Establishing or approving underwriting standards;\n- % Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations;\n- % Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default;\n- % Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and\n- % Maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims.\n\nWe also perform credit reviews, which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty's industry, and the economic environment. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.\n\nOur risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral values, FICO credit scores and other risk factors.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOur credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region.\n\n## Risk Measures\n\nWemeasure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.\n\n## Stress Tests\n\nWe conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\nTo supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.\n\n## Limits\n\nWe use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the limit approval process.\n\nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.\n\n## Risk Mitigants\n\nTo reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.\n\nFor loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\n\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty's financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty's obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Credit Exposures\n\nAs of December 2021, our aggregate credit exposure increased as compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting increases in cash deposits with central banks and loans and lending commitments. The percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) decreased as compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in investment-grade credit exposure related to cash deposits with central banks. Our credit exposures are described further below.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks.\n\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\n\n|                                           | As of December   | As of December   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                             | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents                 | $236,168         | $131,324         |\n| Industry                                  |                  |                  |\n| Financial Institutions                    | 5%               | 11%              |\n| Sovereign                                 | 95%              | 89%              |\n| Total                                     | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Region                                    |                  |                  |\n| Americas                                  | 55%              | 45%              |\n| EMEA                                      | 36%              | 41%              |\n| Asia                                      | 9%               | 14%              |\n| Total                                     | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Credit Quality (Credit Rating Equivalent) |                  |                  |\n| AAA                                       | 64%              | 44%              |\n| AA                                        | 24%              | 38%              |\n| A                                         | 11%              | 17%              |\n| BBB                                       | 1%               | 1%               |\n| Total                                     | 100%             | 100%             |\n\nThe table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $24.87 billion as of December 2021 and $24.52 billion as of December 2020.\n\nOTC Derivatives. Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.\n\nWe generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.\n\nThe table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives and the concentration by industry and region.\n\n|                                            | As of December   | As of December   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                              | 2021             | 2020             |\n| OTC derivative assets                      | $ 58,637         | $ 64,850         |\n| Collateral (not netted under U.S. GAAP)    | (17,245)         | (18,990)         |\n| Net credit exposure                        | $ 41,392         | $ 45,860         |\n| Industry                                   |                  |                  |\n| Consumer & Retail                          | 2%               | 4%               |\n| Diversified Industrials                    | 10%              | 23%              |\n| Financial Institutions                     | 15%              | 12%              |\n| Funds                                      | 13%              | 12%              |\n| Healthcare                                 | 1%               | 2%               |\n| Municipalities & Nonprofit                 | 5%               | 6%               |\n| Natural Resources & Utilities              | 33%              | 11%              |\n| Sovereign                                  | 8%               | 14%              |\n| Technology, Media & Telecommunications     | 8%               | 12%              |\n| Other (including Special Purpose Vehicles) | 5%               | 4%               |\n| Total                                      | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Region                                     |                  |                  |\n| Americas                                   | 53%              | 62%              |\n| EMEA                                       | 37%              | 30%              |\n| Asia                                       | 10%              | 8%               |\n| Total                                      | 100%             | 100%             |\n\nOur credit exposure (before any potential recoveries) to OTC derivative counterparties that defaulted during 2021 remained low, representing less than 2% of our total credit exposure from OTC derivatives.\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % OTC derivative assets, included in the consolidated balance sheets, are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting) and are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting).\n- % Collateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of securities collateral, primarily U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, that we consider when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP.",

We enter into securities financing transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain activities. We bear credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced or the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received. We also have credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned to the extent that the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash or collateral received. Securities collateral for these transactions primarily includes U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations.\n\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from securities financing transactions and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\n\n|                                            | As of December   | As of December   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                              | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Securities Financing Transactions          | $34,505          | $30,190          |\n| Industry                                   |                  |                  |\n| Financial Institutions                     | 34%              | 39%              |\n| Funds                                      | 23%              | 24%              |\n| Municipalities & Nonprofit                 | 5%               | 5%               |\n| Sovereign                                  | 35%              | 30%              |\n| Other (including Special Purpose Vehicles) | 3%               | 2%               |\n| Total                                      | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Region                                     |                  |                  |\n| Americas                                   | 36%              | 33%              |\n| EMEA                                       | 44%              | 46%              |\n| Asia                                       | 20%              | 21%              |\n| Total                                      | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Credit Quality (Credit Rating Equivalent)  |                  |                  |\n| AAA                                        | 19%              | 15%              |\n| AA                                         | 28%              | 28%              |\n| A                                          | 33%              | 40%              |\n| BBB                                        | 9%               | 10%              |\n| BB or lower                                | 11%              | 5%               |\n| Unrated                                    | -                | 2%               |\n| Total                                      | 100%             | 100%             |\n\nThe table above reflects both netting agreements and collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.\n\nOther Credit Exposures. We are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables.\n\nThe table below presents our other credit exposures and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\n\n|                                            | As of December   | As of December   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                              | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Other Credit Exposures                     | $61,187          | $56,429          |\n| Industry                                   |                  |                  |\n| Financial Institutions                     | 86%              | 85%              |\n| Funds                                      | 9%               | 9%               |\n| Other (including Special Purpose Vehicles) | 5%               | 6%               |\n| Total                                      | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Region                                     |                  |                  |\n| Americas                                   | 50%              | 54%              |\n| EMEA                                       | 43%              | 35%              |\n| Asia                                       | 7%               | 11%              |\n| Total                                      | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Credit Quality (Credit Rating Equivalent)  |                  |                  |\n| AAA                                        | 4%               | 5%               |\n| AA                                         | 47%              | 48%              |\n| A                                          | 29%              | 27%              |\n| BBB                                        | 6%               | 8%               |\n| BB or lower                                | 13%              | 11%              |\n| Unrated                                    | 1%               | 1%               |\n| Total                                      | 100%             | 100%             |\n\nThe table above reflects collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.\n\n## Selected Exposures\n\nWe have credit and market exposures, as described below, that have had heightened focus given recent events and broad market concerns.

High external funding needs and inconsistent monetary policy have led to significant depreciation of the Turkish Lira, prompting concerns about foreign exchange reserves and economic instability. As of December 2021, our total credit exposure to Turkey was $1.39 billion, which was to non-sovereign counterparties or borrowers. Such exposure consisted of $663 million related to OTC derivatives, $160 million related to loans and lending commitments and $567 million related to secured receivables. After taking into consideration the benefit of hedges and Turkish corporate and sovereign collateral, and other risk mitigants provided by Turkish counterparties, our net credit exposure was $290 million. In addition, our total market exposure to Turkey as of December 2021 was $105 million, primarily to non-sovereign issuers or underliers. Such exposure consisted of $179 million related to debt, $(156) million related to credit derivatives and $82 million related to equities.\n\nThe potential for further sanctions on Russia has led to concerns about its economic and financial stability. As of December 2021, our total credit exposure to Russia was $650 million, substantially all of which was to non-sovereign counterparties or borrowers. Such exposure consisted of $134 million related to OTC derivatives, $177 million related to loans and lending commitments and $339 million related to secured receivables. After taking into consideration the benefit of Russian corporate and sovereign collateral, and other risk mitigants provided by Russian counterparties, our net credit exposure was $293 million. In addition, our total market exposure to Russia as of December 2021 was $414 million, primarily to non-sovereign issuers or underliers. Such exposure consisted of $258 million related to debt, $(531) million related to credit derivatives and $687 million related to equities.\n\nLiquidity pressures prompted the Argentine government to default and restructure local and foreign obligations in 2020. Economic challenges persist and the country still needs to secure new financial terms with the IMF. As of December 2021, our total credit exposure to Argentina was $102 million, which was to non-sovereign counterparties or borrowers, and was primarily related to loans and lending commitments. In addition, our total market exposure to Argentina as of December 2021 was $91 million, primarily to sovereign issuers or underliers. Such exposure consisted of $70 million related to debt, $(14) million related to credit derivatives and $35 million related to equities.\n\nEscalating geopolitical conflict has led to concerns about Ukraine's political and financial stability. As of December 2021, our total credit exposure to Ukraine was not material. Our total market exposure to Ukraine as of December 2021 was $236 million, primarily to sovereign issuers or underliers. Such exposure consisted of $164 million related to debt, $30 million related to credit derivatives and $42 million related to equities.\n\nLebanon's sovereign debt default and sharp currency depreciation have led to concerns about its financial and political stability. As of December 2021, our total credit and market exposure to Lebanon was not material.\n\nZambia's sovereign debt default and liquidity pressures aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to concerns about the country's financial stability. As of December 2021, our total credit and market exposure to Zambia was not material.\n\nVenezuela has delayed payments on its sovereign debt and is experiencing deep economic and social crises. As of December 2021, our total credit and market exposure to Venezuela was not material.\n\nEscalating political unrest in Ethiopia has led to concerns about the country's political, economic and financial stability. As of December 2021, our total credit and market exposure to Ethiopia was not material.\n\nWe have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer or underlier's assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See 'Stress Tests' for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries.\n\n## Operational Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters.\n\nPotential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include:\n\n- % Execution, delivery and process management;\n- % Business disruption and system failures;\n- % Employment practices and workplace safety;\n- % Clients, products and business practices;\n- % Damage to physical assets;\n- % Internal fraud; and\n- % External fraud.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOperational Risk, which is independent of our revenueproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite.\n\n## Operational Risk Management Process\n\nOur process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management,' including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events.\n\nWe combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-up perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks and risk events to senior management.\n\nWe maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience.\n\nOur operational risk management framework is designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance.\n\nWe have established policies that require all employees to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events.\n\nWe use operational risk management applications to capture, analyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.\n\n## Risk Measurement\n\nWe measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including:\n\n- % Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities;\n- % The degree of automation in our processes;\n- % Newactivity information;\n- % The legal and regulatory environment; and\n- % Changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties.\n\nThe results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\n## Types of Operational Risks\n\nIncreased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cyber security risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. We manage those risks as follows:\n\nInformation and Cyber Security Risk. Information and cyber security risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. We deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cyber security threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. There is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hosted services and applications. See 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about information and cyber security risk.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThird-Party Risk. Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cyber security, resilience and additional thirdparty dependencies. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about third-party risk.\n\nBusiness Resilience Risk. Business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. We approach BCP through the lens of business and operational resilience. The resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent firmwide and up-to-date, incorporating new information, techniques and technologies as and when they become available, and our resilience recovery plans incorporate and test specific and measurable recovery time objectives in accordance with local market best practices and regulatory requirements, and under specific scenarios. See 'Regulatory and Other Matters - Other Matters' for information about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See 'Business - Business Continuity and Information Security' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about business continuity.\n\n## Model Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital.\n\nModel Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\nOur model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our model risk management framework.\n\n## Model Review and Validation Process\n\nModel Risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards.\n\nWe regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation.\n\nThe model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify:\n\n- % The model's conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use;\n- % The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended;\n- % The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model;\n- % The model's accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks;\n- % The model's consistency with models for similar products; and\n- % The model's sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions.\n\nSee 'Critical Accounting Policies - Fair Value - Review of Valuation Models,' 'Liquidity Risk Management,' 'Market Risk Management,' 'Credit Risk Management' and 'Operational Risk Management' for further information about our use of models within these areas.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 117. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.",

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs described in Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2021, the Company carries financial instruments at fair value, which includes $24.1 billion of financial assets and $29.2 billion of financial liabilities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as one or more inputs to the financial instrument's valuation technique are significant and unobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by management to value certain of these Level 3 financial instruments included (i) industry multiples and public comparables, (ii) credit spreads or (iii) correlation.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of these certain Level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in valuing the financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls over the methods and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments. These procedures also included, among others, for a sample of financial instruments, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing an independent estimate of fair value or (ii) testing management's process to determine the fair value of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, (ii) evaluating and utilizing management's significant unobservable inputs or developing independent significant unobservable inputs, and (iii) comparing management's estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Testing management's process included evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, evaluating the appropriateness of the techniques used, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management to determine the fair value of these instruments.",

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses - Wholesale Loan Portfolio\n\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio reflects management's estimate of loan losses over the remaining expected life of the loans and also considers forecasts of future economic conditions. As of December 31, 2021, $2.1 billion of the allowance for loan losses and $131.6 billion of the loans accounted for at amortized cost related to the wholesale loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and assetspecific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. In addition, it includes qualitative components to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The wholesale models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower's capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans include forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the determinations of internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management's determinations, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company's allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio, including controls over the model, certain data, and significant assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, which involved evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in estimating the allowance for loan losses. The procedures also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the model and methodology and (ii) the reasonableness of the internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates used in estimating the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nNewYork, New York February 24, 2022\n\nWehave served as the Company's auditor since 1922.",

All other significant accounting policies are either described below or included in the following footnotes:\n\n| Fair Value Measurements                   | Note 4   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Trading Assets and Liabilities            | Note 5   |\n| Trading Cash Instruments                  | Note 6   |\n| Derivatives and Hedging Activities        | Note 7   |\n| Investments                               | Note 8   |\n| Loans                                     | Note 9   |\n| Fair Value Option                         | Note 10  |\n| Collateralized Agreements and Financings  | Note 11  |\n| Other Assets                              | Note 12  |\n| Deposits                                  | Note 13  |\n| Unsecured Borrowings                      | Note 14  |\n| Other Liabilities                         | Note 15  |\n| Securitization Activities                 | Note 16  |\n| Variable Interest Entities                | Note 17  |\n| Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees | Note 18  |\n| Shareholders' Equity                      | Note 19  |\n| Regulation and Capital Adequacy           | Note 20  |\n| Earnings Per Common Share                 | Note 21  |\n| Transactions with Affiliated Funds        | Note 22  |\n| Interest Income and Interest Expense      | Note 23  |\n| Income Taxes                              | Note 24  |\n| Business Segments                         | Note 25  |\n| Credit Concentrations                     | Note 26  |\n| Legal Proceedings                         | Note 27  |\n| Employee Benefit Plans                    | Note 28  |\n| Employee Incentive Plans                  | Note 29  |\n| Parent Company                            | Note 30  |\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe firm consolidates entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE).\n\nVoting Interest Entities. Voting interest entities are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity is consolidated.\n\nVariable Interest Entities. A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information about VIEs.\n\nEquity-Method Investments. When the firm does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair value by electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity's common stock or in-substance common stock.\n\nIn certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm's principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when costbenefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further information about equity-method investments.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments in funds.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information but actual results could be materially different.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities and certain investments are carried at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in market making or other principal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.\n\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm recognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients for services, such as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing (contracts with clients), when the performance obligations related to the underlying transaction are completed.\n\nRevenues from contracts with clients represent approximately 45% of total non-interest revenues for both 2021 and 2020 (including approximately 90% of investment banking revenues, approximately 95% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees), and approximately 45% of total non-interest revenues for 2019 (including approximately 85% of investment banking revenues, approximately 95% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees). See Note 25 for information about net revenues by business segment.\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nAdvisory. Fees from financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues when the services related to the underlying transaction are completed under the terms of the assignment. Non-refundable deposits and milestone payments in connection with financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction or when the assignment is otherwise concluded.\n\nExpenses associated with financial advisory assignments are recognized when incurred and are included in transaction based expenses. Client reimbursements for such expenses are included in investment banking revenues.\n\nUnderwriting. Fees from underwriting assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction based on the terms of the assignment.\n\nExpenses associated with underwriting assignments are generally deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses are included in transaction based expenses for completed assignments.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Investment Management\n\nThe firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services, which are included in investment management revenues. The firm makes payments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm's investment funds (distribution fees), which are included in transaction based expenses.\n\nManagement Fees. Management fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily net asset value and are received monthly. Management fees for hedge funds and separately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of month-end net asset value and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for private equity funds are calculated as a percentage of monthly invested capital or committed capital and are received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over time in the period the services are provided.\n\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on either a percentage of the management fee, the investment fund's net asset value or the committed capital. Such fees are included in transaction based expenses.\n\nIncentive Fees. Incentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund's or separately managed account's return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performance over a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the measurement period. For fees that are based on investment performance over the life of the fund, future investment underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund.\n\nIncentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed account are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. Therefore, incentive fees recognized during the period may relate to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\n\n## Commissions and Fees\n\nThe firm earns commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures markets, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade is executed. The firm also provides third-party research services to clients in connection with certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented net within commissions and fees.\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRemaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The firm's remaining performance obligations are generally related to its financial advisory assignments and certain investment management activities. Revenues associated with remaining performance obligations relating to financial advisory assignments cannot be determined until the outcome of the transaction. For the firm's investment management activities, where fees are calculated based on the net asset value of the fund or separately managed account, future revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account.\n\nThe firm is able to determine the future revenues associated with management fees calculated based on committed capital. As of December 2021, substantially all future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations will be recognized through 2029. Annual revenues associated with such performance obligations average less than $250 million through 2029.\n\n## Transfers of Financial Assets\n\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, any gains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets or liabilities that arise from the firm's continuing involvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the assets are generally included in trading assets and the transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Cash and cash equivalents included cash and due from banks of $10.14 billion as of December 2021 and $11.95 billion as of December 2020. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-bearing deposits with banks of $250.90 billion as of December 2021 and $143.89 billion as of December2020.\n\nThe firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Cash and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory and other purposes were $24.87 billion as of December 2021 and $24.52 billion as of December 2020. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. See Note 11 for further information about segregated securities.\n\n## Customer and Other Receivables\n\nCustomer and other receivables included receivables from customers and counterparties of $103.82 billion as of December 2021 and $82.39 billion as of December 2020, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $56.85 billion as of December 2021 and $38.94 billion as of December 2020. Such receivables primarily consist of customer margin loans, receivables resulting from unsettled transactions and collateral posted in connection with certain derivative transactions.\n\nSubstantially all of these receivables are accounted for at amortized cost net of any allowance for credit losses, which generally approximates fair value. As these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm's fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these receivables been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020. See Note 10 for further information about customer and other receivables accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Interest on customer and other receivables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income.\n\nCustomer and other receivables includes receivables from contracts with clients and contract assets. Contract assets represent the firm's right to receive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts with clients for which collection is conditional and not merely subject to the passage of time. The firm's receivables from contracts with clients were $3.01 billion as of December 2021 and $2.60 billion as of December 2020. As of both December 2021 and December 2020 contract assets were not material.\n\n## Customer and Other Payables\n\nCustomer and other payables included payables to customers and counterparties of $241.93 billion as of December 2021 and $183.57 billion as of December 2020, and payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $10.00 billion as of December 2021 and $7.09 billion as of December 2020. Such payables primarily consist of customer credit balances related to the firm's prime brokerage activities. Customer and other payables are accounted for at cost plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these payables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm's fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these payables been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020. Interest on customer and other payables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest expense.\n\n## Offsetting Assets and Liabilities\n\nTo reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net settlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a non-defaulting party. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by the netting agreement are terminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities collateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing transactions, subject to the terms of the related credit support agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable credit support agreement grants the non-defaulting party exercising termination rights the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm's right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated balance sheets when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same term and currency are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis in the consolidated balance sheets when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements.\n\nIn the consolidated balance sheets, derivatives are reported net of cash collateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement. In the consolidated balance sheets, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned, are not reported net of the related cash and securities received or posted as collateral. See Note 11 for further information about collateral received and pledged, including rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See Notes 7 and 11 for further information about offsetting assets and liabilities.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a non-U.S. operation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments\n\n## Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\n\nInstruments (ASC 326). In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, 'Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.' This ASU amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses on certain financial instruments, including replacing the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model and amending certain aspects of accounting for purchased financial assets with deterioration in credit quality since origination.\n\nThe firm adopted this ASU in January 2020 under a modified retrospective approach. As a result of adopting this ASU, the firm's allowance for credit losses on financial assets and commitments that are measured at amortized cost reflects management's estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and commitments, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. These expected credit losses are measured based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\n\nThe cumulative effect of measuring the allowance under CECL as a result of adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $848 million. The increase in the allowance is driven by the fact that the allowance under CECL covers expected credit losses over the full expected life of the loan portfolios and also takes into account forecasts of expected future economic conditions. In addition, in accordance with the ASU, the firm elected the fair value option for loans that were previously accounted for as Purchased Credit Impaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease to the allowance for PCI loans of $169 million. The cumulative effect of adopting this ASU was a decrease to retained earnings of $638 million (net of tax).\n\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASC 848). In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.' This ASU provides optional relief from applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. In addition, in January 2021 the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, 'Reference Rate Reform - Scope,' which clarified the scope of ASC 848 relating to contract modifications. The firm adopted these ASUs upon issuance and elected to apply the relief available to certain modified derivatives. The adoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on the firm's consolidated financial statements.",

Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks).\n\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate).\n\nU.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument's level in this hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio's net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\n\nLevel 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2. Inputs to valuation techniques are observable, either directly or indirectly.\n\nLevel 3. One or more inputs to valuation techniques are significant and unobservable.\n\nThe fair values for substantially all of the firm's financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and the firm's credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.\n\nThe valuation techniques and nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the firm's financial instruments are described below. See Notes 5 through 10 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 financial instruments.\n\n## Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans\n\nLevel 1. Level 1 instruments include U.S. government obligations, most non-U.S. government obligations, certain agency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments, certain money market instruments and actively traded listed equities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity.\n\nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain non-U.S. government obligations, most agency obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debt instruments, most state and municipal obligations, most money market instruments, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities, commodities and certain lending commitments.\n\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.",

Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.\n\nLevel 3. Level 3 instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales.\n\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 instrument are described below:\n\n## Loans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real Estate\n\nLoans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or a portfolio of properties and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include:\n\n- % Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and changes in market indices, such as the CMBX (an index that tracks the performance of commercial mortgage bonds);\n- % Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral;\n- % A measure of expected future cash flows in a default scenario (recovery rates) implied by the value of the underlying collateral, which is mainly driven by current performance of the underlying collateral and capitalization rates. Recovery rates are expressed as a percentage of notional or face value of the instrument and reflect the benefit of credit enhancements on certain instruments; and\n- % Timing of expected future cash flows (duration) which, in certain cases, may incorporate the impact of any loan forbearances and other unobservable inputs (e.g., prepayment speeds).\n\n## Loans and Securities Backed by Residential Real Estate\n\nLoans and securities backed by residential real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by portfolios of residential real estate and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Significant inputs include:\n\n- % Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets;\n- % Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral;\n- % Cumulative loss expectations, driven by default rates, home price projections, residential property liquidation timelines, related costs and subsequent recoveries; and\n- % Duration, driven by underlying loan prepayment speeds and residential property liquidation timelines.\n\n## Corporate Debt Instruments\n\nCorporate debt instruments includes corporate loans, debt securities and convertible debentures. Significant inputs for corporate debt instruments are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same or similar issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include:\n\n- % Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market indices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks the performance of corporate credit);\n- % Current performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit default swaps to value the related instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n- % Duration; and\n- % Market and transaction multiples for corporate debt instruments with convertibility or participation options.\n\n## Equity Securities\n\nEquity securities consists of private equities. Recent thirdparty completed or pending transactions (e.g., merger proposals, debt restructurings, tender offers) are considered the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate:\n\n- % Industry multiples (primarily EBITDA and revenue multiples) and public comparables;\n- % Transactions in similar instruments;",

Significant inputs include:\n\n- % Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market indices;\n- % Current performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit default swaps to value the related instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation; and\n- % Duration.\n\n## Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Derivatives\n\nThe firm's level 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued using derivative pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow models, correlation models and models that incorporate option pricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo simulations). Price transparency of derivatives can generally be characterized by product type, as described below.\n\n- % Interest Rate. In general, the key inputs used to value interest rate derivatives are transparent, even for most long-dated contracts. Interest rate swaps and options denominated in the currencies of leading industrialized nations are characterized by high trading volumes and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate derivatives that reference indices, such as an inflation index, or the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year swap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more complex, but the key inputs are generally observable.\n- % Credit. Price transparency for credit default swaps, including both single names and baskets of credits, varies by market and underlying reference entity or obligation. Credit default swaps that reference indices, large corporates and major sovereigns generally exhibit the most price transparency. For credit default swaps with other underliers, price transparency varies based on credit rating, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligations, and the availability of the underlying reference obligations for delivery upon the default of the issuer. Credit default swaps that reference loans, assetbacked securities and emerging market debt instruments tend to have less price transparency than those that reference corporate bonds. In addition, more complex credit derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more underlying reference obligations, generally have less price transparency.\n- % Currency. Prices for currency derivatives based on the exchange rates of leading industrialized nations, including those with longer tenors, are generally transparent. The primary difference between the price transparency of developed and emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets tend to be only observable for contracts with shorter tenors.\n- % Commodity. Commodity derivatives include transactions referenced to energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and electricity), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on the underlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared to unleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency for commodity derivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and contracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n- % Equity. Price transparency for equity derivatives varies by market and underlier. Options on indices and the common stock of corporates included in major equity indices exhibit the most price transparency. Equity derivatives generally have observable market prices, except for contracts with long tenors or reference prices that differ significantly from current market prices. More complex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more individual stocks, generally have less price transparency.\n\nLiquidity is essential to observability of all product types. If transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely, even highly structured products may at times have trading volumes large enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs.",

Level 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price.\n\nLevel 2. Level 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives.\n\nThe selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant management judgment because outputs of models can be calibrated to market-clearing levels.\n\nValuation models require a variety of inputs, such as contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discount rates (including those derived from interest rates on collateral received and posted as specified in credit support agreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the valuations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.\n\nLevel 3. Level 3 derivatives are valued using models which utilize observable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well as unobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm's level 3 derivatives are described below.\n\n- % For level 3 interest rate and currency derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include correlations of certain currencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlation between Euro inflation and Euro interest rates) and specific interest rate and currency volatilities.\n- % For level 3 credit derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include illiquid credit spreads and upfront credit points, which are unique to specific reference obligations and reference entities, and recovery rates.\n\n- % For level 3 commodity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include volatilities for options with strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices and prices or spreads for certain products for which the product quality or physical location of the commodity is not aligned with benchmark indices.\n- % For level 3 equity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs generally include equity volatility inputs for options that are long-dated and/or have strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices. In addition, the valuation of certain structured trades requires the use of level 3 correlation inputs, such as the correlation of the price performance of two or more individual stocks or the correlation of the price performance for a basket of stocks to another asset class, such as commodities.\n\nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect observable market changes and any resulting gains and losses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when corroborated by evidence, such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. In circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by reference to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See Note 7 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of level 3 derivatives.\n\nValuation Adjustments. Valuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust the mid-market valuations produced by derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and funding valuation adjustments, which account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm also makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledge collateral received. Market-based inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments to market-clearing levels.\n\nIn addition, for derivatives that include significant unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price adjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty present in the transaction.",

Such instruments include resale and repurchase agreements; certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; certain customer and other receivables, including certain margin loans; certain time deposits, including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; substantially all other secured financings, including transfers of assets accounted for as financings; certain unsecured shortand long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments; and certain other liabilities. These instruments are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally classified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for counterparty and the firm's credit quality. The significant inputs used to value the firm's other financial instruments are described below.\n\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned. The significant inputs to the valuation of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and interest rates.\n\nCustomer and Other Receivables. The significant inputs to the valuation of receivables are interest rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and funding spreads.\n\nDeposits. The significant inputs to the valuation of time deposits are interest rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm's other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 13 for further information about deposits.\n\nOther Secured Financings. The significant inputs to the valuation of other secured financings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, funding spreads and the fair value of the collateral delivered by the firm (determined using the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market prices, market yields and recovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings.\n\nUnsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings. The significant inputs to the valuation of unsecured short- and long-term borrowings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, the credit spreads of the firm and commodity prices for prepaid commodity transactions. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm's other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 14 for further information about borrowings.\n\nOther Liabilities. The significant inputs to the valuation of other liabilities are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and equity volatility and correlation inputs. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm's other derivative instruments described above.

The net realized and unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets of $77 million (reflecting $66 million of net realized gains and $143 million of net unrealized losses) for 2020 included gains/(losses) of $(193) million reported in market making and $116 million reported in interest income.\n\nThe net unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets for 2020 primarily reflected losses on certain corporate debt instruments (principally driven by wider credit spreads).\n\nTransfers into level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2020 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments).\n\nTransfers out of level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2020 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments, and loans and securities backed by residential real estate to level 2 (in each case, principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments).\n\n## Note 7.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging Activities\n\n## Derivative Activities\n\nDerivatives are instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm's OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC).",

As a market maker, the firm enters into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role, the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commit capital to provide execution, and maintains market-making positions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand.\n\nRisk Management. The firm also enters into derivatives to actively manage risk exposures that arise from its marketmaking and investing and financing activities. The firm's holdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an instrument-by-instrument basis. The offsetting impact of this economic hedging is reflected in the same business segment as the related revenues. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits, foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale securities and the net investment in certain non-U.S. operations, and the price risk of certain commodities.\n\nThe firm enters into various types of derivatives, including:\n\n- % Futures and Forwards. Contracts that commit counterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments, commodities or currencies in the future.\n- % Swaps. Contracts that require counterparties to exchange cash flows, such as currency or interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms of the contract with reference to specified rates, financial instruments, commodities, currencies or indices.\n- % Options. Contracts in which the option purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the option writer financial instruments, commodities or currencies within a defined time period for a specified price.\n\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). Derivative assets are included in trading assets and derivative liabilities are included in trading liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are included in market making (for derivatives included in the Global Markets segment), and other principal transactions (for derivatives included in the remaining business segments) in the consolidated statements of earnings. For both 2021 and 2020, substantially all of the firm's derivatives were included in the Global Markets segment.\n\nThe tables below present the gross fair value and the notional amounts of derivative contracts by major product type, the amounts of counterparty and cash collateral netting in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as cash and securities collateral posted and received under enforceable credit support agreements that do not meet the criteria for netting under U.S. GAAP.\n\n|                                               | As of December 2021                           | As

An average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average. For example, the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range.\n\n- % The ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative. For example, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 derivatives.\n- % Interest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models, credit derivatives are valued using option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models.\n- % The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, option pricing models and discounted cash flow models are typically used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques.\n- % Correlation within currencies and equities includes crossproduct type correlation.\n- % Natural gas spread represents the spread per million British thermal units of natural gas.\n- % Oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products.\n- % Electricity price represents the price per megawatt hour of electricity.\n\n## Range of Significant Unobservable Inputs\n\nThe following provides information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm's level 3 derivative instruments:\n\n- % Correlation. Ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index and equity single stock names) and across product types (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well as across regions. Generally, cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type.\n- % Volatility. Ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets, maturities and strike prices. For example, volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks.",

The ranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index and single names), regions, sectors, maturities and credit qualities (high-yield and investment-grade). The broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs.\n- % Commodity prices and spreads. The ranges for commodity prices and spreads cover variability in products, maturities and delivery locations.\n\n## Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurement to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs\n\nThe following is a description of the directional sensitivity of the firm's level 3 fair value measurements to changes in significant unobservable inputs, in isolation, as of each period-end:\n\n- % Correlation. In general, for contracts where the holder benefits from the convergence of the underlying asset or index prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), an increase in correlation results in a higher fair value measurement.\n- % Volatility. In general, for purchased options, an increase in volatility results in a higher fair value measurement.\n- % Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates. In general, the fair value of purchased credit protection increases as credit spreads or upfront credit points increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates are strongly related to distinctive risk factors of the underlying reference obligations, which include reference entityspecific factors, such as leverage, volatility and industry, market-based risk factors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity of the underlying reference obligation, and macroeconomic conditions.\n- % Commodity prices and spreads. In general, for contracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, an increase in the spread (price difference from a benchmark index due to differences in quality or delivery location) or price results in a higher fair value measurement.\n\nDue to the distinctive nature of each of the firm's level 3 derivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.\n\n## Level 3 Rollforward\n\nThe table below presents a summary of the changes in fair value for level 3 derivatives.\n\n|                                | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions                  | 2021                  | 2020                  |\n| Total level 3 derivatives, net |                       |                       |\n| Beginning balance              | $ 1,175               | $ 25                  |\n| Net realized gains/(losses)    | 265                   | 226                   |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses)  | 452                   | 612                   |\n| Purchases                      | 501                   | 319                   |\n| Sales                          | (1,541)               | (724)                 |\n| Settlements                    | (59)                  | 750                   |\n| Transfers into level 3         | (131)                 | (40)                  |\n| Transfers out of level 3       | (222)                 | 7                     |\n| Ending balance                 | $ 440                 | $1,175                |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % Changes in fair value are presented for all derivative assets and liabilities that are classified in level 3 as of the end of the period.\n- % Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates to instruments that were still held at period-end.\n- % Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives of $717 million (reflecting $265 million of net realized gains and $452 million of net unrealized gains) for 2021 included gains of $700 million reported in market making and gains of $17 million reported in other principal transactions.\n\nThe net unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for 2021 were primarily attributable to gains on certain credit and currency derivatives (in each case, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in commodity prices) and gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in interest rates), partially offset by losses on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in equity prices).\n\nThe drivers of transfers into level 3 derivatives during 2021 were not material.\n\nTransfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain interest rate derivative assets to level 2 (principally due to increased transparency of certain volatility inputs used to value these derivatives).\n\nYear Ended December 2020. The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives of $838 million (reflecting $226 million of net realized gains and $612 million of net unrealized gains) for 2020 included gains of $900 million reported in market making and losses of $62 million reported in other principal transactions.\n\nThe net unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for 2020 were primarily attributable to gains on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in equity prices), gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in commodity prices), and gains on certain credit derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates), partially offset by losses on certain currency derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and a decrease in interest rates).\n\nThe drivers of both transfers into level 3 derivatives and transfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2020 were not material.",

Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm's net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity.\n\nThe firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives:\n\n- % Credit Default Swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in the event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer, calculated according to the terms of the contract.\n- % Credit Options. In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.",

Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction's total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions (tranches), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche.\n- % Total Return Swaps. A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation.\n\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially all of the firm's purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event, the firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of default.\n\nAs of December 2021, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $510.24 billion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $569.34 billion, for total net notional purchased protection of $59.10 billion. As of December 2020, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $515.85 billion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $558.18 billion, for total net notional purchased protection of $42.33 billion. The firm's written and purchased credit derivatives primarily consist of credit default swaps.\n\nThe table below presents information about credit derivatives.\n\n|

These derivatives are included in unsecured shortand long-term borrowings, as well as other secured financings, with the related borrowings.\n\n## Derivatives with Credit-Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain of the firm's derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require the firm to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in the firm's credit ratings. The firm assesses the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency's relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies.\n\nThe table below presents information about net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements (excluding collateral posted), the fair value of collateral posted and additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in the firm's credit ratings.\n\n|                                                       | As of December   | As of December   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                                         | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements | $34,315          | $43,368          |\n| Collateral posted                                     | $29,214          | $35,296          |\n| Additional collateral or termination payments:        |                  |                  |\n| One-notch downgrade                                   | $ 345            | $ 481            |\n| Two-notch downgrade                                   | $ 1,536          | $ 1,388          |\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\nThe firm applies hedge accounting for (i) interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixedrate unsecured long- and short-term borrowings and certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit, (ii) foreign exchange forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale securities, (iii) foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign currency exposures on the firm's net investment in certain non-U.S. operations and (iv) commodity futures contracts used to manage the price risk of certain commodities.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Additionally, the firm must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nThe firm designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term debt and fixed-rate certificates of deposit. These interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or Overnight Index Swap Rate), effectively converting a substantial portion of fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations.\n\nThe firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing the effectiveness of these hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%.\n\nFor qualifying interest rate fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives are included in interest expense. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value (hedging adjustment) and is also included in interest expense. When a derivative is no longer designated as a hedge, any remaining difference between the carrying value and par value of the hedged item is amortized in interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\n\nThe table below presents the gains/(losses) from interest rate derivatives accounted for as hedges and the related hedged borrowings and deposits, and total interest expense.\n\n|                                | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions                  | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Interest rate hedges           | $(6,638)              | $ 3,862               | $ 3,196               |\n| Hedged borrowings and deposits | $ 6,085               | $(4,557)              | $ (3,657)             |\n| Interest expense               | $ 5,650               | $ 8,938               | $17,376               |\n\nThe table below presents the carrying value of deposits and unsecured borrowings that are designated in a hedging relationship and the related cumulative hedging adjustment (increase/(decrease)) from current and prior hedging relationships included in such carrying values.\n\n| $ in millions                   | Carrying Value   | Cumulative Hedging Adjustment   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| As of December 2021             |                  |                                 |\n| Deposits                        | $ 14,131         | $ 246                           |\n| Unsecured short-term borrowings | $ 2,167          | $ 5                             |\n| Unsecured long-term borrowings  | $144,934         | $ 6,169                         |\n| As of December 2020             |                  |                                 |\n| Deposits                        | $ 17,303         | $ 649                           |\n| Unsecured short-term borrowings | $ 5,976          | $ 53                            |\n| Unsecured long-term borrowings  | $115,242         | $11,624                         |\n\nIn the table above, cumulative hedging adjustment included $5.91 billion as of December 2021 and $6.34 billion as of December 2020 of hedging adjustments from prior hedging relationships that were de-designated and substantially all were related to unsecured long-term borrowings.\n\nIn addition, cumulative hedging adjustments for items no longer designated in a hedging relationship were $68 million as of December 2021 and $489 million as of December 2020 and substantially all were related to unsecured long-term borrowings.\n\nThe firm designates foreign exchange forward contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign exchange risk of non-U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale.

For foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts (i.e., based on changes in forward rates). For foreign currency-denominated debt designated as a hedge, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on changes in spot rates. For qualifying net investment hedges, all gains or losses on the hedging instruments are included in currency translation.\n\nThe table below presents the gains/(losses) from net investment hedging.\n\n|                                   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions                     | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Hedges:                           |                       |                       |                       |\n| Foreign currency forward contract | $755                  | $(126)                | $ 6                   |\n| Foreign currency-denominated debt | $386                  | $(297)                | $(19)                 |\n\nGains or losses on individual net investments in non-U.S. operations are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) to other principal transactions in the consolidated statements of earnings when such net investments are sold or substantially liquidated.

The firm uses NAV to measure the fair value of fund investments when (i) the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the NAV of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the investments at fair value.\n\nSubstantially all of the firm's investments in funds at NAV consist of investments in firm-sponsored private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds where the firm co-invests with third-party investors.\n\nPrivate equity funds primarily invest in a broad range of industries worldwide, including leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments and distressed investments. Credit funds generally invest in loans and other fixed income instruments and are focused on providing private high-yield capital for leveraged and management buyout transactions, recapitalizations, financings, refinancings, acquisitions and restructurings for private equity firms, private family companies and corporate issuers. Real estate funds invest globally, primarily in real estate companies, loan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and property. Private equity, credit and real estate funds are closed-end funds in which the firm's investments are generally not eligible for redemption. Distributions will be received from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.\n\nThe firm also invests in hedge funds, primarily multidisciplinary hedge funds that employ a fundamental bottom-up investment approach across various asset classes and strategies. The firm's investments in hedge funds primarily include interests where the underlying assets are illiquid in nature, and proceeds from redemptions will not be received until the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.\n\nPrivate equity and hedge funds described above are primarily 'covered funds' as defined in the Volcker Rule of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Substantially all of the credit and real estate funds described above are not covered funds. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) extended the conformance period to July 2022 for the firm's investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy 'illiquid funds' (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. This extension is applicable to substantially all of the firm's remaining investments in, and relationships with, such covered funds. As of December 2021, the firm's total investments in funds at NAV of $3.47 billion included $903 million of investments in covered funds for which compliance with the Volcker Rule will need to be achieved by July 2022.\n\nThe firm expects to achieve compliance for these covered funds through ongoing harvesting of underlying fund investments in the ordinary course or through structural modifications to these funds. To the extent that the firm is not able to achieve compliance through these measures, the firm will be required to sell its interests in such funds by July 2022. If that occurs, the firm may receive a value for its interests that is less than the then carrying value as there could be a limited secondary market for these investments and the firm may be unable to sell them in orderly transactions.",

The gross unrealized gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) were $631 million and the gross unrealized losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) were not material as of December 2020. Net unrealized gains/ (losses) included in other comprehensive income/(loss) were $(1.28) billion ($(955) million, net of tax) for 2021 and $557 million ($417 million, net of tax) for 2020.\n- % If the fair value of available-for-sale securities is less than amortized cost, such securities are considered impaired. If the firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, the difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance, if any) and the fair value of the securities is recognized as an impairment loss in earnings. The firm did not record any such impairment losses during either 2021 or 2020. Impaired available-for-sale debt securities that the firm has the intent and ability to hold are reviewed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded. The firm considers various factors in such determination, including market conditions, changes in issuer credit ratings and severity of the unrealized losses. The firm did not record any provision for credit losses on such securities during either 2021 or 2020.",

Corporate loans includes term loans, revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and bridge loans, and are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes, or in connection with acquisitions. Corporate loans may be secured or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors.\n- % Wealth Management. Wealth management loans includes loans extended to private bank clients, including wealth management and other clients. These loans are used to finance investments in both financial and nonfinancial assets, bridge cash flow timing gaps or provide liquidity for other needs. Substantially all of such loans are secured by securities, residential real estate, commercial real estate or other assets.\n- % Commercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate loans includes originated loans (other than those extended to private bank clients) that are directly or indirectly secured by hotels, retail stores, multifamily housing complexes and commercial and industrial properties. Commercial real estate loans also includes loans extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly backed by commercial real estate. In addition, commercial real estate includes loans purchased by the firm.\n- % Residential Real Estate. Residential real estate loans primarily includes loans extended by the firm to clients (other than those extended to private bank clients) who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by residential real estate and loans purchased by the firm.\n- % Installment. Installment loans are unsecured and are originated by the firm.\n- % Credit Cards. Credit card loans are loans made pursuant to revolving lines of credit issued to consumers by the firm.\n- % Other. Other loans primarily includes loans extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by consumer loans, including auto loans and private student loans, and other assets. Other loans also includes unsecured consumer and credit card loans purchased by the firm.\n\n## Credit Quality\n\nRisk Assessment. The firm's risk assessment process includes evaluating the credit quality of its loans by our independent risk oversight and control function. For corporate loans and a majority of wealth management, real estate and other loans, the firm performs credit reviews which include initial and ongoing analyses of its borrowers, resulting in an internal credit rating. A credit review is an analysis of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to meet its financial obligations and is performed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances change that indicate that a review may be necessary. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the borrower's industry and the economic environment.",

The firm's risk assessment process for these loans includes reviewing certain key metrics, such as loan-to-value ratio, delinquency status, collateral values, expected cash flows, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score (which measures a borrower's creditworthiness by considering factors such as payment and credit history) and other risk factors.\n- % For installment and credit card loans included in the other metrics/unrated category, the evaluation of credit quality incorporates the borrower's FICO credit score. FICO credit scores are periodically refreshed by the firm to assess the updated creditworthiness of the borrower. See 'Vintage' below for information about installment and credit card loans by FICO credit scores.\n\nThe firm also assigns a regulatory risk rating to its loans based on the definitions provided by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. Total loans included 92% of loans as of December 2021 and 85% of loans as of December 2020 that were rated pass/non-criticized.",

Loans accounted for at amortized cost (other than credit card loans) are placed on nonaccrual status when it is probable that the firm will not collect all principal and interest due under the contractual terms, regardless of the delinquency status or if a loan is past due for 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well collateralized and in the process of collection. At that time, all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed collectible. Otherwise, all cash received is used to reduce the outstanding loan balance. A loan is considered past due when a principal or interest payment has not been made according to its contractual terms. Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and accrue interest until the loan is paid in full or is charged off.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the firm may modify the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, typically in the form of a modification of loan covenants, but may also include forbearance of interest or principal, payment extensions or interest rate reductions. These modifications, to the extent significant, are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Loan modifications that extend payment terms for a period of less than 90 days are generally considered insignificant and therefore not reported as TDRs.\n\nThe firm adopted the relief issued under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), as amended, and certain interpretive guidance issued by the U.S. banking agencies that provides for certain modified loans that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR to not be classified as such. Loans accounted for at amortized cost that were not classified as TDRs as a result of this relief and interpretive guidance were $166 million as of December 2021 and were $184 million as of December 2020. The relief provided under the CARES Act expired in January 2022.",

The firm's lending commitments related to these loans were not material as of both December 2021 and December 2020. Installment loans that were modified in a TDR were not material as of both December 2021 and December 2020.\n- % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonaccrual loans was 144.7% as of December 2021 and 109.1% as of December 2020.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe firm's allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost. Loans and lending commitments accounted for at fair value or accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value are not subject to an allowance for credit losses.\n\nTo determine the allowance for credit losses, the firm classifies its loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which the firm has developed and documented its methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loan and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios described below. The firm applies judgment in weighing individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including the firm's internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk.",

The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within the firm's independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within the firm's independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While management uses the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used.\n\nThe table below presents gross loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost by portfolio.\n\n|                         | As of December   | As of December      | As of December   | As of December      |\n|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n|                         | 2021             | 2021                | 2020             | 2020                |\n| $ in millions           | Loans            | Lending Commitments | Loans            | Lending Commitments |\n| Wholesale               |                  |                     |                  |                     |\n| Corporate               | $ 50,960         | $143,296            | $ 44,778         | $127,756            |\n| Wealth management       | 38,062           | 4,091               | 25,151           | 2,314               |\n| Commercial real estate  | 21,150           | 4,306               | 17,096           | 4,154               |\n| Residential real estate | 15,493           | 3,317               | 5,236            | 1,804               |\n| Other                   | 5,958            | 6,169               | 3,211            | 4,841               |\n| Consumer                |                  |                     |                  |                     |\n| Installment             | 3,672            | 9                   | 3,823            | 4                   |\n| Credit cards            | 8,212            | 35,932              | 4,270            | 21,640              |\n| Total                   | $143,507         | $197,120            | $103,565         | $162,513            |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % Wholesale loans included $2.43 billion as of December 2021 and $3.51 billion as of December 2020 of nonaccrual loans for which the allowance for credit losses was measured on an asset-specific basis. The allowance for credit losses on these loans was $543 million as of December 2021 and $649 million as of December 2020. These loans included $140 million as of December 2021 and $584 million as of December 2020 of loans which did not require a reserve as the loan was deemed to be recoverable.\n- % Credit card lending commitments included $33.97 billion as of December 2021 and $21.64 billion as of December 2020 related to credit card lines issued by the firm to consumers. These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. Credit card lending commitments also included approximately $2.0 billion as of December 2021 related to a commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio.\n\nSee Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\n\nThe following is a description of the methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses:\n\nWholesale. The allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans and lending commitments that exhibit similar risk characteristics is measured using a modeled approach. These models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower's capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. For lending commitments, the methodology also considers probability of drawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans and lending commitments include unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or loans in a TDR, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective rate, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral.\n\nWholesale loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\n\nConsumer. The allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculated using a modeled approach which classifies consumer loans into pools based on borrower-related and exposure-related characteristics that differentiate a pool's risk characteristics from other pools. The factors considered in determining a pool are generally consistent with the risk characteristics used for internal credit risk measurement and management and include key metrics, such as FICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for consumer loans include unemployment rates and delinquency rates. The expected life of revolving credit card loans is determined by modeling expected future draws and the timing and amount of repayments allocated to the funded balance. The firm also recognizes an allowance for credit losses on commitments to acquire loans. However, no allowance for credit losses is recognized on credit card lending commitments as they are cancellable by the firm.",

The cumulative effect was an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $679 million, which consisted of (i) an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $727 million (an increase in the allowance for wholesale loans of $452 million, an increase in the allowance for consumer loans of $444 million and a decrease in the allowance for PCI loans of $169 million) and (ii) a decrease in the allowance for lending commitments of $48 million.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses Commentary\n\nYear Ended December 2021. The allowance for credit losses decreased by $82 million during 2021.\n\nThe provision for credit losses reflected growth in the firm's lending portfolios, primarily in the consumer portfolio related to credit cards, including a provision for credit losses of approximately $185 million relating to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio, largely offset by reserve reduction driven by improved broader economic environment.\n\nNet charge-offs for 2021 for wholesale loans were primarily related to corporate loans and net charge-offs for consumer loans were primarily related to credit cards.\n\nForecast model inputs as of December 2021. When modeling expected credit losses, the firm employs a weighted, multi-scenario forecast, which includes baseline, adverse and favorable economic scenarios. As of December 2021, this multi-scenario forecast was primarily weighted towards the baseline economic scenario.\n\nThe table below presents the forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates used in the baseline economic scenario of the forecast model.\n\n|                                 | As of December 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| U.S. unemployment rate          |                       |\n| Forecast for the quarter ended: |                       |\n| June 2022                       | 3.7%                  |\n| December 2022                   | 3.5%                  |\n| June 2023                       | 3.4%                  |\n| Growth in U.S. GDP              |                       |\n| Forecast for the year:          |                       |\n| 2022                            | 3.4%                  |\n| 2023                            | 2.1%                  |\n| 2024                            | 1.8%                  |\n\nIn addition, in the adverse economic scenario in the firm's forecast model, the U.S. unemployment rate peaks at approximately 9.5% during the first quarter of 2023 and the maximum decline in the quarterly U.S. GDP relative to the fourth quarter of 2021 is approximately 2.5%, which occurs during the first quarter of 2023.",

The allowance for credit losses increased by $2.63 billion during 2020 reflecting $679 million relating to the impact of CECL adoption and $1.95 billion from activity during the period.\n\nThe provision for credit losses for wholesale and consumer loans reflected the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on economic conditions, which resulted in higher modeled expected losses and lower recoveries. In addition, the provision for credit losses for wholesale loans was impacted by asset-specific provisions and ratings downgrades primarily related to borrowers in the diversified industrials, technology, media & telecommunications and natural resources industries. Besides the weaker economic outlook related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision for credit losses for consumer loans for 2020 was also impacted by the growth of the credit card portfolio.\n\nNet charge-offs for 2020 for wholesale loans were primarily related to corporate loans and net charge-offs for consumer loans were primarily related to installment loans.\n\n## Fair Value of Loans by Level\n\nThe table below presents loans held for investment accounted for at fair value under the fair value option by level within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n| $ in millions           | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Total   |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| As of December 2021     |           |           |           |         |\n| Loan Type               |           |           |           |         |\n| Corporate               | $ -       | $ 1,655   | $ 837     | $ 2,492 |\n| Wealth management       | -         | 5,873     | 63        | 5,936   |\n| Commercial real estate  | -         | 605       | 983       | 1,588   |\n| Residential real estate | -         | 115       | 205       | 320     |\n| Other                   | -         | 167       | 266       | 433     |\n| Total                   | $ -       | $ 8,415   | $2,354    | $10,769 |\n| As of December 2020     |           |           |           |         |\n| Loan Type               |           |           |           |         |\n| Corporate               | $ -       | $ 1,822   | $ 929     | $ 2,751 |\n| Wealth management       | -         | 7,809     | 63        | 7,872   |\n| Commercial real estate  | -         | 857       | 1,104     | 1,961   |\n| Residential real estate | -         | 234       | 260       | 494     |\n| Other                   | -         | 225       | 322       | 547     |\n| Total                   | $ -       | $10,947   | $2,678    | $13,625 |\n\nThe gains as a result of changes in the fair value of loans held for investment for which the fair value option was elected were $216 million for 2021 and $151 million for 2020.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 loans of $66 million (reflecting $99 million of net realized gains and $33 million of net unrealized losses) for 2021 included gains of $42 million reported in other principal transactions and $24 million reported in interest income.\n\nThe drivers of the net unrealized losses on level 3 loans for 2021 were not material.\n\nTransfers into level 3 loans during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain loans backed by commercial real estate from level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable yield and duration inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these instruments) and transfers of certain corporate loans from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments).",

The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to:\n\n- % Reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis;\n- % Mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assets accounted for as financings are recorded at fair value, whereas the related secured financing would be recorded on an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option); and\n- % Address simplification and cost-benefit considerations (e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fair value in their entirety versus bifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts).\n\nHybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., physical commodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate the embedded derivative from the associated debt, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedges. If the firm does not elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\n\nOther financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option include:\n\n- % Resale and repurchase agreements;\n- % Certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions;\n- % Certain customer and other receivables and certain other liabilities;\n- % Certain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity are not eligible for a fair value option election), including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments;\n- % Substantially all other secured financings, including transfers of assets accounted for as financings; and\n- % Certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments.",

The ranges and weighted averages of significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 other secured financings are presented below. These ranges and weighted averages exclude unobservable inputs that are only relevant to a single instrument, and therefore are not meaningful.\n\n## As of December 2021:\n\n- % Yield: 1.3% to 6.4% (weighted average: 2.1%)\n- % Duration: 0.6 to 7.1 years (weighted average: 3.7 years)\n\n## As of December 2020:\n\n- % Yield: 1.4% to 7.1% (weighted average: 2.7%)\n- % Duration: 1.4 to 8.0 years (weighted average: 4.0 years)\n\nGenerally, increases in yield or duration, in isolation, would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement as of period-end. Due to the distinctive nature of each of level 3 other secured financings, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform across such financings. See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings.\n\nDeposits, Unsecured Borrowings and Other Liabilities. Substantially all of the firm's deposits, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and other liabilities that are classified in level 3 are hybrid financial instruments. As the significant unobservable inputs used to value hybrid financial instruments primarily relate to the embedded derivative component of these deposits, unsecured borrowings and other liabilities, these unobservable inputs are incorporated in the firm's derivative disclosures in Note 7. See Note 13 for further information about deposits, Note 14 for further information about unsecured borrowings and Note 15 for further information about other liabilities.\n\nRepurchase Agreements. As of December 2021, the firm had no level 3 repurchase agreements. As of December 2020, the firm's level 3 repurchase agreements were not material.",

As a result, gains or losses included in the level 3 rollforward below do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm's results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\n\nThe table below presents information, by the consolidated balance sheet line items, for liabilities included in the summary table above.\n\n|                                 | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions                   | 2021                  | 2020                  |\n| Deposits                        |                       |                       |\n| Beginning balance               | $ (4,221)             | $ (4,023)             |\n| Net realized gains/(losses)     | (28)                  | 1                     |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses)   | (110)                 | (319)                 |\n| Issuances                       | (473)                 | (4,049)               |\n| Settlements                     | 1,203                 | 4,168                 |\n| Transfers into level 3          | (70)                  | (57)                  |\n| Transfers out of level 3        | 86                    | 58                    |\n| Ending balance                  | $ (3,613)             | $ (4,221)             |\n| Repurchase agreements           |                       |                       |\n| Beginning balance               | $ (2)                 | $ (30)                |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses)   | 1                     | (2)                   |\n| Settlements                     | 1                     | 30                    |\n| Ending balance                  | $ -                   | $ (2)                 |\n| Other secured financings        |                       |                       |\n| Beginning balance               | $ (3,474)             | $ (386)               |\n| Net realized gains/(losses)     | (27)                  | 13                    |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses)   | 63                    | (142)                 |\n| Issuances                       | (145)                 | (1,195)               |\n| Settlements                     | 779                   | 368                   |\n| Transfers into level 3          | (135)                 | (2,132)               |\n| Transfers out of level 3        | 373                   | -                     |\n| Ending balance                  | $ (2,566)             | $ (3,474)             |\n| Unsecured short-term borrowings |                       |                       |\n| Beginning balance               | $ (7,523)             | $ (5,707)             |\n| Net realized gains/(losses)     | (134)                 | (132)                 |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses)   | 374                   | (215)                 |\n| Issuances                       | (7,878)               | (6,634)               |\n| Settlements                     | 7,188                 | 5,029                 |\n| Transfers into level 3          | (163)                 | (629)                 |\n| Transfers out of level 3        | 307                   | 765                   |\n| Ending balance                  | $ (7,829)             | $ (7,523)             |\n| Unsecured long-term borrowings  |                       |                       |\n| Beginning balance               | $(12,576)             | $(10,741)             |\n| Net realized gains/(losses)     | (212)                 | (229)                 |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses)   | 381                   | (510)                 |\n| Issuances                       | (4,136)               | (6,215)               |\n| Settlements                     | 5,759                 | 5,778                 |\n| Transfers into level 3          | (368)                 | (757)                 |\n| Transfers out of level 3        | 1,739                 | 98                    |\n| Ending balance                  | $ (9,413)             | $(12,576)             |\n| Other liabilities               |                       |                       |\n| Beginning balance               | $ (262)               | $ (149)               |\n| Net realized gains/(losses)     | -                     | 30                    |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses)   | 116                   | (113)                 |\n| Issuances                       | -                     | (30)                  |\n| Ending balance                  | $ (146)               | $ (262)               |\n\n## Level 3 Rollforward Commentary\n\nYear Ended December 2021.

See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\n\n## Impact of Credit Spreads on Loans and Lending Commitments\n\nThe estimated net gain/(loss) attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads on loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $277 million for 2021, $(106) million for 2020 and $134 million for 2019. The firm generally calculates the fair value of loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the instrument-specific credit spreads. For floating-rate loans and lending commitments, substantially all changes in fair value are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads, whereas for fixed-rate loans and lending commitments, changes in fair value are also attributable to changes in interest rates.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 11.\n\n## Collateralized Agreements and Financings\n\nCollateralized agreements are resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. The firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain firm activities.\n\nCollateralized agreements and financings are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis when a legal right of setoff exists. Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included in interest income, and collateralized financings, which is included in interest expense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\n\n## Resale and Repurchase Agreements\n\nA resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date.\n\nA repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date.\n\nEven though repurchase and resale agreements (including 'reposand reverses-to-maturity') involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency, and investment-grade sovereign obligations.\n\nThe firm receives financial instruments purchased under resale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments sold under repurchase agreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these financial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the financial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Securities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions\n\nIn a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows securities from a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the firm returns the securities, the counterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction.\n\nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the counterparty returns the securities, the firm returns the cash or securities posted as collateral. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction.\n\nThe firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of securities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these securities on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the securities, as appropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the securities borrowed transaction.\n\nSecurities borrowed and loaned within Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) financing are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 for further information about securities borrowed and loaned accounted for at fair value.\n\nSubstantially all of securities borrowed and loaned within Equities financing are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. The firm also reviews such securities borrowed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded by taking into consideration the fair value of collateral received. As these agreements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value of such agreements approximates fair value. As these agreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm's fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these agreements been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020.",

These other secured financings include:\n\n- % Liabilities of consolidated VIEs;\n- % Transfers of assets accounted for as financings rather than sales (e.g., pledged commodities, bank loans and mortgage whole loans); and\n- % Other structured financing arrangements.\n\nOther secured financings included nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse other secured financings were $8.64 billion as of December 2021 and $12.31 billion as of December 2020.\n\nThe firm has elected to apply the fair value option to substantially all other secured financings because the use of fair value eliminates non-economic volatility in earnings that would arise from using different measurement attributes. See Note 10 for further information about other secured financings that are accounted for at fair value.\n\nOther secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these financings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm's fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these financings been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 3 as of both December 2021 and December 2020.\n\nThe table below presents information about other secured financings.\n\n| $ in millions                               | U.S. Dollar                                 | Non-U.S. Dollar   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| As of December 2021                         |                                             |                   |         |\n| Other secured financings (short-term):      |                                             |                   |         |\n| At fair value                               | $ 5,315                                     | $ 3,664           | $ 8,979 |\n| At amortized cost                           | -                                           | 191               | 191     |\n| Other secured financings (long-term):       |                                             |                   |         |\n| At fair value                               | 4,170                                       | 3,925             | 8,095   |\n| At amortized cost                           | 827                                         | 452               | 1,279   |\n| Total other secured financings              | $10,312                                     | $ 8,232           | $18,544 |\n| Other secured financings collateralized by: | Other secured financings collateralized by: |                   |         |\n| Financial instruments                       | $ 5,990                                     | $ 6,834           | $12,824 |\n| Other assets                                | $ 4,322                                     | $ 1,398           | $ 5,720 |\n| As of December 2020                         |                                             |                   |         |\n| Other secured financings (short-term):      | Other secured financings (short-term):      |                   |         |\n| At fair value                               | $ 6,371                                     | $ 6,847           | $13,218 |\n| At amortized cost                           | -                                           | -                 | -       |\n| Other secured financings (long-term):       |                                             |                   |         |\n| At fair value                               | 6,632                                       | 4,276             | 10,908  |\n| At amortized cost                           | 914                                         | 715               | 1,629   |\n| Total other secured financings              | $13,917                                     | $11,838           | $25,755 |\n| Other secured financings collateralized by: | Other secured financings collateralized by: |                   |         |\n| Financial instruments                       | $ 6,841                                     | $10,068           | $16,909 |\n| Other assets                                | $ 7,076                                     | $ 1,770           | $ 8,846 |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % Short-term other secured financings includes financings maturing within one year of the financial statement date and financings that are redeemable within one year of the financial statement date at the option of the holder.\n- % Non-U.S. dollar-denominated short-term other secured financings at amortized cost had a weighted average interest rate of 0.22% as of December 2021.

The firm obtains cash and securities as collateral on an upfront or contingent basis for derivative instruments and collateralized agreements to reduce its credit exposure to individual counterparties.\n\nIn many cases, the firm is permitted to deliver or repledge financial instruments received as collateral when entering into repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, primarily in connection with secured client financing activities. The firm is also permitted to deliver or repledge these financial instruments in connection with other secured financings, collateralized derivative transactions and firm or customer settlement requirements.\n\nThe firm also pledges certain trading assets in connection with repurchase agreements, securities loaned transactions and other secured financings, and other assets (substantially all real estate and cash) in connection with other secured financings to counterparties who may or may not have the right to deliver or repledge them.\n\nThe table below presents financial instruments at fair value received as collateral that were available to be delivered or repledged and were delivered or repledged.\n\n|                                                   | As of December   | As of December   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                                     | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Collateral available to be delivered or repledged | $1,057,195       | $864,494         |\n| Collateral that was delivered or repledged        | $ 875,213        | $723,409         |\n\nThe table below presents information about assets pledged.\n\n|                                                                              | As of December                                                               | As of December                                                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| $ in millions                                                                | 2021                                                                         | 2020                                                                         |\n| Pledged to counterparties that had the right to deliver or repledge          | Pledged to counterparties that had the right to deliver or repledge          | Pledged to counterparties that had the right to deliver or repledge          |\n| Trading assets                                                               | $ 68,208                                                                     | $ 69,031                                                                     |\n| Investments                                                                  | $ 12,840                                                                     | $ 13,375                                                                     |\n| Pledged to counterparties that did not have the right to deliver or repledge | Pledged to counterparties that did not have the right to deliver or repledge | Pledged to counterparties that did not have the right to deliver or repledge |\n| Trading assets                                                               | $ 102,259                                                                    | $ 99,142                                                                     |\n| Investments                                                                  | $ 8,683                                                                      | $ 2,331                                                                      |\n| Loans                                                                        | $ 6,808                                                                      | $ 8,320                                                                      |\n| Other assets                                                                 | $ 8,878                                                                      | $ 14,144                                                                     |\n\nThe firm also segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity.

Property, leasehold improvements and equipment included $6.71 billion as of December 2021 and $6.54 billion as of December 2020 that the firm uses in connection with its operations, and $194 million as of December 2021 and $318 million as of December 2020 of foreclosed real estate primarily related to distressed loans that were purchased by the firm. The remainder is held by investment entities, including VIEs, consolidated by the firm. Substantially all property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease. Capitalized costs of software developed or obtained for internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years.\n\nThe firm tests property, leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.\n\nThe firm had impairments of $143 million during 2021 and $171 million during 2020, primarily related to properties held by the firm's investment entities. There were no material impairments during 2019.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.\n\nThe table below presents the carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit.\n\n|                               | As of December   | As of December   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                 | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Investment Banking            | $ 281            | $ 281            |\n| Global Markets:               |                  |                  |\n| FICC                          | 269              | 269              |\n| Equities                      | 2,638            | 2,644            |\n| Asset Management              | 349              | 390              |\n| Consumer & Wealth Management: |                  |                  |\n| Consumer banking              | 48               | 48               |\n| Wealth management             | 700              | 700              |\n| Total                         | $4,285           | $4,332           |\n\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting unit's estimated fair value exceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated net book value.\n\nTo estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, other than Consumer banking, a relative value technique is used because the firm believes market participants would use this technique to value these reporting units. The relative value technique applies observable price-to-earnings multiples or price-to-book multiples of comparable competitors to reporting units' net earnings or net book value. To estimate the fair value of Consumer banking, a discounted cash flow valuation approach is used because the firm believes market participants would use this technique to value that reporting unit given its early stage of development. The estimated net carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders' equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders' equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the firm performed its annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, for each of its reporting units, by performing a qualitative assessment. Multiple factors were assessed with respect to each of the firm's reporting units to determine whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of any of those reporting units was less than its estimated carrying value. The qualitative assessment also considered changes since a quantitative test was last performed in 2019.\n\nThe firm considered the following factors in the qualitative annual assessment when evaluating whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit was less than its estimated carrying value:\n\n- % Performance Indicators. During 2021, the firm's net revenues, diluted earnings per common share (EPS), return on average common shareholders' equity and book value per common share all increased from 2020 and from when a quantitative test was last performed in 2019. The firm's operating expenses increased, primarily reflecting significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong financial performance). Despite the increase in expenses, both the efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) and pre-tax margin improved compared with 2020.\n- % Macroeconomic Indicators. The global economy continued to recover during 2021 from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the lifting of health and safety restrictions amid vaccine distribution facilitated an increase in global economic recovery, and monetary and fiscal policy from central banks and governments remained accommodative. However, there remains uncertainty related to the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- % Firm and Industry Events. There were no events, entityspecific or otherwise, that would have had a significant negative impact on the valuation of the firm's reporting units.\n- % Fair Value Indicators. Since the 2020 qualitative goodwill test, fair value indicators in the market generally improved, as global equity prices were higher, credit spreads were tighter, and the firm and its peers' stock prices and price-to-book multiples were higher. Despite increased inflation concerns, supply chain challenges and the rise in COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter of 2021, the firm's stock price and price-to-book multiple ended the year higher compared with the end of 2020.\n\nAs a result of the qualitative assessment, the firm determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective estimated carrying value. Therefore, the firm determined that goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was not required.\n\n## Identifiable Intangible Assets\n\nThe table below presents identifiable intangible assets by reporting unit and type.\n\n|                                | As of December   | As of December   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                  | 2021             | 2020             |\n| By Reporting Unit              |                  |                  |\n| Global Markets:                |                  |                  |\n| FICC                           | $ 1              | $ 2              |\n| Equities                       | 43               | 45               |\n| Asset Management               | 122              | 274              |\n| Consumer & Wealth Management:  |                  |                  |\n| Consumer banking               | -                | 6                |\n| Wealth management              | 252              | 303              |\n| Total                          | $ 418            | $ 630            |\n| By Type                        |                  |                  |\n| Customer lists                 |                  |                  |\n| Gross carrying value           | $ 1,460          | $ 1,478          |\n| Accumulated amortization       | (1,130)          | (1,089)          |\n| Net carrying value             | 330              | 389              |\n| Acquired leases and other      |                  |                  |\n| Gross carrying value           | 500              | 710              |\n| Accumulated amortization       | (412)            | (469)            |\n| Net carrying value             | 88               | 241              |\n| Total gross carrying value     | 1,960            | 2,188            |\n| Total accumulated amortization | (1,542)          | (1,558)          |\n| Total net carrying value       | $ 418            | $ 630            |\n\nDuring 2021, the amount of intangible assets acquired by the firm was not material.

To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. There were no material impairments during 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\n## Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets\n\nThe firm enters into operating leases for real estate, office equipment and other assets, substantially all of which are used in connection with its operations. For leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. The lease term is generally determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease. For leases where the firm has the option to terminate or extend the lease, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising the option is incorporated into the determination of the lease term. Such assessment is initially performed at the inception of the lease and is updated if events occur that impact the original assessment.\n\nAn operating lease right-of-use asset is initially determined based on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior to lease commencement. This amount is then amortized over the lease term. The firm recognized $305 million for 2021, $182 million for 2020 and $963 million (primarily related to the firm's European headquarters in London) for 2019 of right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in non-cash transactions for leases entered into or assumed. See Note 15 for information about operating lease liabilities.\n\nFor leases where the firm will derive no economic benefit from leased space that it has vacated or where the firm has shortened the term of a lease when space is no longer needed, the firm will record an impairment or accelerated amortization of right-of-use assets. There were no material impairments or accelerated amortizations during 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Miscellaneous Receivables and Other\n\nMiscellaneous receivables and other included:\n\n- % Investments in qualified affordable housing projects of $714 million as of December 2021 and $678 million as of December 2020.\n- % Assets classified as held for sale of $1.02 billion as of December 2021 and $437 million as of December 2020 related to certain of the firm's consolidated investments within the Asset Management segment, substantially all of which consisted of property and equipment.\n\n## Note 13.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe table below presents the types and sources of deposits.\n\n| $ in millions                    | Savings and Demand   | Time     | Total    |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|\n| As of December 2021              |                      |          |          |\n| Consumer                         | $ 89,150             | $ 20,533 | $109,683 |\n| Private bank                     | 85,427               | 9,665    | 95,092   |\n| Brokered certificates of deposit | -                    | 30,816   | 30,816   |\n| Deposit sweep programs           | 37,965               | -        | 37,965   |\n| Transaction banking              | 48,618               | 5,689    | 54,307   |\n| Other                            | 275                  | 36,089   | 36,364   |\n| Total                            | $261,435             | $102,792 | $364,227 |\n| As of December 2020              |                      |          |          |\n| Consumer                         | $ 67,395             | $ 29,530 | $ 96,925 |\n| Private bank                     | 67,185               | 1,183    | 68,368   |\n| Brokered certificates of deposit | -                    | 30,060   | 30,060   |\n| Deposit sweep programs           | 22,987               | -        | 22,987   |\n| Transaction banking              | 28,852               | -        | 28,852   |\n| Other                            | -                    | 12,770   | 12,770   |\n| Total                            | $186,419             | $ 73,543 | $259,962 |",

The estimated fair value of such unsecured long-term borrowings was $209.37 billion as of December 2021 and $183.29 billion as of December 2020.

Subordinated debt that matures within one year is included in unsecured short-term borrowings. Junior subordinated debt is junior in right of payment to other subordinated borrowings, which are junior to senior borrowings.

See Note 7 for further information about hedging activities.\n\n## Junior Subordinated Debt\n\nIn 2004, Group Inc. issued $2.84 billion of junior subordinated debt to Goldman Sachs Capital I (Trust), a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust issued $2.75 billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests (Trust Preferred securities) to third parties and $85 million of common beneficial interests to Group Inc. As of both December 2021 and December 2020, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by the Trust was $968 million and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by the Trust was $939 million and $29 million, respectively. The Trust is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes.",

The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on the Trust's preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. The Trust is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on the preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full.\n\nThe firm has covenanted in favor of the holders of Group Inc.'s 6.345% junior subordinated debt due February 15, 2034, that, subject to certain exceptions, the firm will not redeem or purchase the capital securities issued by Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (APEX Trusts) or shares of Group Inc.'s Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E (Series E Preferred Stock), Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F (Series F Preferred Stock) or Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series O, if the redemption or purchase results in less than $253 million aggregate liquidation preference of that series outstanding, prior to specified dates in 2022 for a price that exceeds a maximum amount determined by reference to the net cash proceeds that the firm has received from the sale of qualifying securities.\n\nThe APEX Trusts hold Group Inc.'s Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock.

Variable lease costs, which are included in operating lease costs, were not material for 2021, 2020 and 2019. Total occupancy expenses for space held in excess of the firm's current requirements were not material for both 2021 and 2020.\n\nLease payments relating to operating lease arrangements that were signed, but had not yet commenced were $300million as of December 2021.\n\n## Accrued Expenses and Other\n\nAccrued expenses and other included:\n\n- % Liabilities classified as held for sale of $310 million as of December 2021 related to certain of the firm's consolidated investments within the Asset Management segment, substantially all of which consisted of other secured financings primarily carried at fair value under the fair value option, and were related to assets classified as held for sale. See Note 12 for further information about assets held for sale. As of December 2020, liabilities classified as held for sale were not material.\n- % Contract liabilities, which represent consideration received by the firm in connection with its contracts with clients prior to providing the service. As of both December 2021 and December 2020, the firm's contract liabilities were not material.\n\n## Note 16.\n\n## Securitization Activities\n\nThe firm securitizes residential and commercial mortgages, corporate bonds, loans and other types of financial assets by selling these assets to securitization vehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and limited liability companies) or through a resecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter of the beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm's residential mortgage securitizations are primarily in connection with government agency securitizations.\n\nThe firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has relinquished control over the transferred financial assets. Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assets pending transfer at fair value and therefore does not typically recognize significant gains or losses upon the transfer of assets. Net revenues from underwriting activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the underlying beneficial interests to investors.\n\nThe firm generally receives cash in exchange for the transferred assets but may also have continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets, including ownership of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, primarily in the form of debt instruments. The firm may also purchase senior or subordinated securities issued by securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) in connection with secondary market-making activities.\n\nThe primary risks included in beneficial interests and other interests from the firm's continuing involvement with securitization vehicles are the performance of the underlying collateral, the position of the firm's investment in the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and the market yield for the security. Interests accounted for at fair value are primarily classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Interests not accounted for at fair value are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. See Notes 4 through 10 for further information about fair value measurements.\n\nThe table below presents the amount of financial assets securitized and the cash flows received on retained interests in securitization entities in which the firm had continuing involvement as of the end of the period.\n\n|                               | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions                 | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Residential mortgages         | $29,048               | $20,167               | $15,124               |\n| Commercial mortgages          | 18,396                | 14,904                | 12,741                |\n| Other financial assets        | 4,377                 | 1,775                 | 1,252                 |\n| Total financial assets        | $51,821               | $36,846               | $29,117               |\n| Retained interests cash flows | $ 513                 | $ 331                 | $ 286                 |\n\nThe firm securitized assets of $886 million for 2021, $551 million for 2020 and $601 million for 2019, in a non-cash exchange for loans and investments.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 17.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nA variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or equity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans and lending commitments) that will absorb portions of the VIE's expected losses and/or receive portions of the VIE's expected residual returns.\n\nThe firm's variable interests in VIEs include senior and subordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited and general partnership interests; preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk.\n\nVIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are either collateralized by or indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity securities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. The firm's involvement with VIEs includes securitization of financial assets, as described in Note 16, and investments in and loans to other types of VIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the firm's consolidation policies, including the definition of a VIE.\n\n## VIE Consolidation Analysis\n\nThe enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers:\n\n- % Which variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance;\n- % Which variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE;\n- % The VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders;\n- % The VIE's capital structure;\n- % The terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders and other parties involved with the VIE; and\n- % Related-party relationships.\n\nThe firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts and circumstances.\n\n## VIE Activities\n\nThe firm is principally involved with VIEs through the following business activities:\n\nMortgage-Backed VIEs. The firm sells residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgagebacked VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk.\n\nReal Estate, Credit- and Power-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The firm purchases equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets and equity securities. The firm generally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these VIEs.\n\nCorporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and receives the return on the collateral owned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firm may be removed as the total return swap counterparty and may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk related to these swaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it structures.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nPrincipal-Protected Note VIEs. The firm structures VIEs that issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEs own portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedge funds. Substantially all of the principal protection on the notes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfolio rebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes. The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs under which the firm pays the VIE the return due to the principal-protected note holders and receives the return on the assets owned by the VIE. The firm may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk. The firm also obtains funding through these VIEs.\n\nInvestments in Funds. The firm makes equity investments in certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is entitled to receive fees from these VIEs. The firm has generally not sold assets to, or entered into derivatives with, these VIEs.\n\n## Nonconsolidated VIEs\n\nThe table below presents a summary of the nonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds variable interests.\n\n|                                                    | As of December   | As of December   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                                      | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Total nonconsolidated VIEs                         |                  |                  |\n| Assets in VIEs                                     | $176,809         | $148,665         |\n| Carrying value of variable interests - assets      | $ 9,582          | $ 8,624          |\n| Carrying value of variable interests - liabilities | $ 928            | $ 888            |\n| Maximum exposure to loss:                          |                  |                  |\n| Retained interests                                 | $ 3,552          | $ 3,182          |\n| Purchased interests                                | 1,071            | 1,041            |\n| Commitments and guarantees                         | 2,440            | 2,455            |\n| Derivatives                                        | 8,682            | 8,343            |\n| Debt and equity                                    | 4,639            | 4,020            |\n| Total                                              | $ 20,384         | $ 19,041         |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % The nature of the firm's variable interests is described in the rows under maximum exposure to loss.\n- % The firm's exposure to the obligations of VIEs is generally limited to its interests in these entities.

Previously, such letters of credit were disclosed as a separate line item in the tables above. Previously reported amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.\n\n## Lending Commitments\n\nThe firm's commercial and warehouse financing lending commitments are agreements to lend with fixed termination dates and depend on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to borrowing. These commitments are presented net of amounts syndicated to third parties. The total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect actual future cash flows because the firm may syndicate portions of these commitments. In addition, commitments can expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterparty's request. The firm also provides credit to consumers by issuing credit card lines.\n\nThe table below presents information about lending commitments.\n\n|                     | As of December   | As of December   |\n|---------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions       | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Held for investment | $197,120         | $162,513         |\n| Held for sale       | 13,175           | 6,594            |\n| At fair value       | 1,257            | 2,468            |\n| Total               | $211,552         | $171,575         |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % Held for investment lending commitments are accounted for at amortized cost. The carrying value of lending commitments was a liability of $1.05 billion (including allowance for credit losses of $776 million) as of December 2021 and $775 million (including allowance for credit losses of $557 million) as of December 2020. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a liability of $4.17 billion as of December 2021 and $4.05 billion as of December 2020. Had these lending commitments been carried at fair value and included in the fair value hierarchy, $1.91 billion as of December 2021 and $2.43 billion as of December 2020 would have been classified in level 2, and $2.26 billion as of December 2021 and $1.62 billion as of December2020 would have been classified in level 3.\n- % Held for sale lending commitments are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of lending commitments held for sale was a liability of $91 million as of December 2021 and $68 million as of December 2020. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments approximates the carrying value. Had these lending commitments been included in the fair value hierarchy, they would have been primarily classified in level 3 as of both December 2021 and December 2020.\n- % Gains or losses related to lending commitments at fair value, if any, are generally recorded net of any fees in other principal transactions.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nCommercial Lending. The firm's commercial lending commitments were primarily extended to investment-grade corporate borrowers. Such commitments primarily included $120.99 billion as of December 2021 and $110.31 billion as of December 2020, related to relationship lending activities (principally used for operating and general corporate purposes) and $21.07 billion as of December 2021 and $15.81 billion as of December 2020, related to other investment banking activities (generally extended for contingent acquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources). The firm also extends lending commitments in connection with other types of corporate lending, as well as commercial real estate financing. See Note 9 for further information about funded loans.\n\nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with the firm's commercial lending activities, the firm obtains credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes.\n\nWarehouse Financing. The firm provides financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements are secured by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of residential real estate, consumer and corporate loans.\n\nCredit Cards. The firm's credit card lending commitments included $33.97 billion as of December 2021 and $21.64 billion as of December 2020 related to credit card lines issued by the firm to consumers. These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. Credit card commitments also includes approximately $2.0 billion relating to the firm's commitment to acquire a credit card portfolio in connection with its agreement, in January 2021, to form a co-branded credit card relationship with General Motors. This acquisition was completed in February 2022.\n\n## Risk Participations\n\nThe firm also risk participates certain of its commercial lending commitments to other financial institutions. In the event of a risk participant's default, the firm will be responsible to fund the borrower.\n\n## Collateralized Agreement Commitments/ Collateralized Financing Commitments\n\nCollateralized agreement commitments includes forward starting resale and securities borrowing agreements, and collateralized financing commitments includes forward starting repurchase and secured lending agreements that settle at a future date, generally within three business days. Collateralized agreement commitments also includes transactions where the firm has entered into commitments to provide contingent financing to its clients and counterparties through resale agreements. The firm's funding of these commitments depends on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale agreement and these commitments can expire unused.\n\n## Investment Commitments\n\nInvestment commitments includes commitments to invest in private equity, real estate and other assets directly and through funds that the firm raises and manages. Investment commitments included $1.60 billion as of December 2021 and $1.69 billion as of December 2020, related to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm. If these commitments are called, they would be funded at market value on the date of investment.\n\nInvestment commitments also included approximately $1.90 billion as of December 2021 related to the firm's commitment to acquire NN Investment Partners, a leading European asset manager with approximately $320 billion in assets under supervision, in an all-cash transaction. This acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022. In addition, investment commitments included approximately $2.0 billion as of December 2021 related to the firm's commitment to acquire GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky), a leading technology company facilitating point-of-sale financing for merchants and consumers. This acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. The GreenSky acquisition will be an all-stock transaction in which stockholders of GreenSky and unit holders of GreenSky Holdings, LLC (GreenSky Holdings) will receive 0.03 shares of the firm's common stock for each share of GreenSky Class A common stock and each GreenSky Holdings common unit. The investment commitment in the table above represents the purchase price of the acquisition based on the stock price of Group Inc. as of December 2021. However, the final purchase price of the acquisition will depend upon the stock price of Group Inc. at the time of the closing of the transaction. In connection with this transaction, the firm provided a commitment to acquire up to $800 million of loans originated by GreenSky's bank partners, and, as of December 2021, had acquired approximately $200 million of loans under this commitment. The remaining commitment of approximately $600 million is included in other commitments in the table above. In the event that the acquisition is not completed, the firm has agreed to provide a commitment to purchase up to an additional $1.0 billion of loans originated by GreenSky's bank partners. This commitment is not included in the table above.",

See the tables in 'Commitments' above for a summary of the firm's commitments.\n- % The carrying value for derivatives included derivative assets of $1.10 billion as of December 2021 and $1.66 billion as of December 2020, and derivative liabilities of $4.51 billion as of December 2021 and $6.02 billion as of December 2020.\n\nDerivative Guarantees. The firm enters into various derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the firm's overall risk related to derivative activities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held the underlying instruments at inception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for certain large, internationally active commercial and investment bank counterparties, central clearing counterparties, hedge funds and certain other counterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the table above. See Note 7 for information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, which are not included in the table above.\n\nDerivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the carrying value is considered the best indication of payment/ performance risk for individual contracts. However, the carrying values in the table above exclude the effect of counterparty and cash collateral netting.\n\nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees. Securities lending and clearing guarantees include the indemnifications and guarantees that the firm provides in its capacity as an agency lender and in its capacity as a sponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation.\n\nAs an agency lender, the firm indemnifies most of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in the event that borrowers do not return securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the securities borrowed. The maximum payout of such indemnifications was $11.05 billion as of December 2021 and $19.86 billion as of December 2020. Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications was $11.36 billion as of December 2021 and $20.39 billion as of December 2020. Because the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with these indemnifications.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the performance of its sponsored member clients to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in connection with certain resale and repurchase agreements. To minimize potential losses on such guarantees, the firm obtains a security interest in the collateral that the sponsored client placed with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on such guarantees is minimal. There were no amounts outstanding under the guarantee as of December 2021. As of December 2020, the maximum payout on this guarantee was $1.49 billion and the related collateral held was $1.50 billion.\n\nOther Financial Guarantees. In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary. Other financial guarantees also include a guarantee that the firm has provided to the Government of Malaysia that it will receive at least $1.4 billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). The firm evaluates progress toward satisfying this obligation based on the report that it receives on a semiannual basis, expected in February and August. Based on the latest report as of August 2021, approximately $450 million in assets or proceeds from assets has been returned to the Government of Malaysia in connection with this guarantee, which must be satisfied by August 18, 2025. Any amounts paid by the firm under this guarantee would be subject to reimbursement in the event the assets or proceeds received by the Government of Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceeds $1.4 billion. See Note 27 for further information about matters related to 1MDB.\n\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, the APEX Trusts and other entities, for the limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firm does not consolidate these entities. See Note 14 for further information about the transactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I and the APEX Trusts.\n\nThe firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities issued by these entities. No subsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the securities of Goldman Sachs Capital I or the APEX Trusts.\n\nManagement believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to make payments related to these entities other than those required under the terms of the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements and in connection with certain expenses incurred by these entities.\n\n## Indemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers. In\n\nthe ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates.\n\nThe firm may also be liable to some clients or other parties for losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or omissions of third-party service providers, including sub-custodians and third-party brokers. In certain cases, the firm has the right to seek indemnification from these thirdparty service providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks, as well as securities exchanges around the world that may require the firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of member defaults and other loss scenarios.\n\nIn connection with the firm's prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle on behalf of its clients the transactions entered into by them with other brokerage firms. The firm's obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the client's account, as well as any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and certain other matters involving the borrower.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2021 and December 2020.\n\nOther Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications. The firm provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives.\n\nIn addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an adverse application of certain non-U.S. tax laws.\n\nThese indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2021 and December 2020.\n\nGuarantees of Subsidiaries. Group Inc. is the entity that fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by GS Finance Corp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees to Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) related to agreements that each entity has entered into with certain of its counterparties. Furthermore, Group Inc. provided a guarantee to GS Bank USA in 2020 related to securities that GS Bank USA acquired from certain affiliated funds of Group Inc. and loans and lending commitments that GS Bank USA acquired from certain subsidiaries of Group Inc. As of December 2021, none of the securities acquired from the affiliated funds were outstanding.\n\nGroup Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. Group Inc. is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under its subsidiary guarantees. However, because these obligations are also obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, Group Inc.'s liabilities as guarantor are not separately disclosed.\n\n## Note 19.\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\n## Common Equity\n\nAs of both December 2021 and December 2020, the firm had 4.00 billion authorized shares of common stock and 200 million authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each with a par value of $0.01 per share.\n\nThe firm's share repurchase program is intended to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The share repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by the firm's current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of the firm's common stock. The firm suspended stock repurchases during the first quarter of 2020 and, consistent with the FRB's requirement for all large bank holding companies (BHCs), extended the suspension of stock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020. The firm resumed stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThe table below presents information about common stock repurchases.\n\n|                                        | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| in millions, except per share amounts  | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Common share repurchases               | 15.3                  | 8.2                   | 25.8                  |\n| Average cost per share                 | $339.81               | $236.35               | $206.56               |\n| Total cost of common share repurchases | $ 5,200               | $ 1,928               | $ 5,335               |\n\nPursuant to the terms of certain share-based compensation plans, employees may remit shares to the firm or the firm may cancel share-based awards to satisfy statutory employee tax withholding requirements. Under these plans, 1,830 shares in 2021, 3,476 shares in 2020 and 7,490 shares in 2019 were remitted with a total value of $0.5 million in 2021, $0.9 million in 2020 and $2 million in 2019, and the firm cancelled 3.4 million share-based awards in 2021, 3.4 million in 2020 and 3.8 million in 2019 with a total value of $984 million in 2021, $829million in 2020 and $743 million in 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 20.\n\n## Regulation and Capital Adequacy\n\nThe FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under amendments to this Act. The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework).\n\nThe capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet exposures. Failure to comply with these capital requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the firm's regulators and could limit the firm's ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. The firm's capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm's subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements.\n\n## Capital Framework\n\nThe regulations under the Capital Framework are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III) and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an 'Advanced approach' banking organization and has been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).\n\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements. The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as CommonEquity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.\n\nThe firm calculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules must meet its respective capital requirements.\n\nUnder the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject to leverage requirements which consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.\n\n## Consolidated Regulatory Capital Requirements\n\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios. The table below presents the risk-based capital requirements.\n\n|                      | Standardized   | Advanced   |\n|----------------------|----------------|------------|\n| As of December 2021  |                |            |\n| CET1 capital ratio   | 13.4%          | 9.5%       |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio | 14.9%          | 11.0%      |\n| Total capital ratio  | 16.9%          | 13.0%      |\n| As of December 2020  |                |            |\n| CET1 capital ratio   | 13.6%          | 9.5%       |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio | 15.1%          | 11.0%      |\n| Total capital ratio  | 17.1%          | 13.0%      |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % As of both December 2021 and December 2020, under both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules, the CET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 4.5%, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 6.0% and the Total capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 8.0%. These requirements also include the capital conservation buffer requirements, consisting of the G-SIB surcharge of 2.5% (Method 2) and the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent. In addition, the capital conservation buffer requirements include the stress capital buffer (SCB) of 6.4% as of December 2021 and 6.6% as of December 2020 under the Standardized Capital Rules and a buffer of 2.5% as of both December 2021 and December 2020 under the Advanced Capital Rules.\n- % The G-SIB surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year and is generally applicable for the following year. The G-SIB surcharge is calculated using two methodologies, the higher of which is reflected in the firm's risk-based capital requirements. The first calculation (Method 1) is based on the Basel Committee's methodology which, among other factors, relies upon measures of the size, activity and complexity of each G-SIB. The second calculation (Method 2) uses similar inputs but includes a measure of reliance on shortterm wholesale funding.",

In addition, the firm elected to increase regulatory capital by 25% of the increase in the allowance for credit losses since January 1, 2020, as permitted by the rules issued by the FRB. The impact of this increase will also be phased in over the three-year transition period. Reflecting the full impact of CECL as of both December 2021 and December 2020 would not have had a material impact on the firm's capital ratios.\n- % In the third quarter of 2021, based on regulatory feedback, the firm revised certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the calculation of Standardized RWAs. As of December 2020, this change would have increased the firm's Standardized RWAs of $554 billion by approximately $23 billion, which would have reduced the firm's Standardized CET1 capital ratio of 14.7% by 0.6 percentage points, Standardized Tier 1 capital ratio of 16.7% by 0.6 percentage points and Standardized Total capital ratio of 19.5% by 0.8 percentage points.\n- % In December 2021, the firm early adopted the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' final rule that implements the new standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). SA-CCR replaced the current exposure method for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts for determining Standardized RWAs and supplementary leverage exposure. Adoption of SA-CCR resulted in a decrease to the firm's Standardized CET1 capital ratio by approximately 0.3 percentage points as of December 2021.\n\nLeverage Ratios.

The impact of this temporary amendment was an increase in the firm's SLR by approximately 1.0 percentage points for the three months ended December 2020. The amendment permitting this exclusion expired on April 1, 2021.\n- % Off-balance sheet and other exposures primarily includes the monthly average of off-balance sheet exposures, consisting of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees.\n- % Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by average adjusted total assets.\n- % SLR is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure. Adoption of SA-CCR in December 2021, as described above, did not result in a material impact to the firm's SLR for the three months ended December 2021.",

RWAs are calculated in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure, which are then risk weighted under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules:\n\n- % The Standardized Capital Rules apply prescribed riskweights, which depend largely on the type of counterparty. The exposure measure for derivatives and securities financing transactions are based on specific formulas which take certain factors into consideration.\n- % Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm computes risk-weights for wholesale and retail credit exposures in accordance with the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The exposure measures for derivatives and securities financing transactions are computed utilizing internal models.\n- % For both Standardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the risk-weights for securitizations and equities are based on specific required formulaic approaches.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nRWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent. Market RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which include the following:\n\n- % Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations, the firm uses a single VaR model which captures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. However, VaR used for risk management purposes differs from VaR used for regulatory capital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons, confidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaR is calculated. For risk management purposes, a 95% one-day VaR is used, whereas for regulatory capital requirements, a 99% 10-day VaR is used to determine Market RWAs and a 99% one-day VaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR.\n\nThe firm's positional losses observed on a single day exceeded its 99% one-day regulatory VaR on one occasion during 2021 and on six occasions during 2020 (all of which occurred during March 2020 and, as permitted by the FRB, did not have any impact on the firm's VaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs);\n\n- % Stressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, during a period of significant market stress;\n- % Incremental risk is the potential loss in value of non-securitized positions due to the default or credit migration of issuers of financial instruments over a one-year time horizon;\n- % Comprehensive risk is the potential loss in value, due to price risk and defaults, within the firm's credit correlation positions; and\n- % Specific risk is the risk of loss on a position that could result from factors other than broad market movements, including event risk, default risk and idiosyncratic risk. The standardized measurement method is used to determine specific risk RWAs, by applying supervisory defined risk-weighting factors after applicable netting is performed.\n\n## Operational Risk\n\nOperational RWAs are only required to be included under the Advanced Capital Rules. The firm utilizes an internal risk-based model to quantify Operational RWAs.\n\nThe table below presents information about RWAs.\n\n| $ in millions                     | Standardized   | Advanced   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|------------|\n| As of December 2021               |                |            |\n| Credit RWAs                       |                |            |\n| Derivatives                       | $175,628       | $109,532   |\n| Commitments, guarantees and loans | 233,639        | 182,210    |\n| Securities financing transactions | 76,346         | 14,407     |\n| Equity investments                | 43,256         | 45,582     |\n| Other                             | 71,485         | 86,768     |\n| Total Credit RWAs                 | 600,354        | 438,499    |\n| Market RWAs                       |                |            |\n| Regulatory VaR                    | 13,510         | 13,510     |\n| Stressed VaR                      | 38,922         | 38,922     |\n| Incremental risk                  | 6,867          | 6,867      |\n| Comprehensive risk                | 2,521          | 2,521      |\n| Specific risk                     | 14,689         | 14,689     |\n| Total Market RWAs                 | 76,509         | 76,509     |\n| Total Operational RWAs            | -              | 132,913    |\n| Total RWAs                        | $676,863       | $647,921   |\n| As of December 2020               |                |            |\n| Credit RWAs                       |                |            |\n| Derivatives                       | $120,292       | $111,691   |\n| Commitments, guarantees and loans | 176,501        | 151,587    |\n| Securities financing transactions | 71,427         | 16,568     |\n| Equity investments                | 46,944         | 49,268     |\n| Other                             | 70,274         | 83,599     |\n| Total Credit RWAs                 | 485,438        | 412,713    |\n| Market RWAs                       |                |            |\n| Regulatory VaR                    | 14,913         | 14,913     |\n| Stressed VaR                      | 31,978         | 31,978     |\n| Incremental risk                  | 7,882          | 7,882      |\n| Comprehensive risk                | 1,758          | 1,758      |\n| Specific risk                     | 12,193         | 12,193     |\n| Total Market RWAs                 | 68,724         | 68,724     |\n| Total Operational RWAs            | -              | 128,313    |\n| Total RWAs                        | $554,162       | $609,750   |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % Securities financing transactions represents resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions.\n- % Other includes receivables, certain debt securities, cash and cash equivalents, and other assets.",

Standardized Credit RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $114.92 billion compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity and revisions to certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the RWA calculation based on regulatory feedback) and an increase in derivatives (principally due to increased exposures and the impact of SA-CCR adoption). Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $7.79 billion compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in stressed VaR (principally due to increased exposures to interest rates).\n\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $25.79 billion compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity). This increase was partially offset by a decrease in equity investments (principally due to the sale of equity positions). Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $7.79 billion compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in stressed VaR (principally due to increased exposures to interest rates). Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $4.60 billion compared with December 2020, primarily associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nYear Ended December 2020. Standardized Credit RWAs as of December 2020 decreased by $13.55 billion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting a decrease in equity investments (principally due to the sale of certain equity positions) and a decrease in other (principally due to decreased receivables as a result of changes in risk measurements). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in securities financing transactions (principally due to increased funding exposures). Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $4.14 billion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to increased market volatility) and an increase in incremental risk (principally due to increased exposures in equities held for market-making purposes). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in specific risk (principally due to changes in risk measurements on certain exposures).\n\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $51.63 billion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in derivatives (principally due to the impact of higher levels of volatility and counterparty credit risk) and an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity investments (principally due to the sale of certain equity positions). Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $4.34 billion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to increased market volatility) and an increase in incremental risk (principally due to increased exposures in equities held for market-making purposes). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in specific risk (principally due to changes in risk measurements on certain exposures). Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $9.13 billion compared with December 2019. The vast majority of this increase was associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.",

GS Bank USA is an Advanced approach banking organization under the Capital Framework.\n\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements (consisting of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer). The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as CET1 capital. In addition, the Capital Framework includes the leverage ratio requirement.\n\nGS Bank USA is required to calculate the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The lower of each risk-based capital ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is the ratio against which GS Bank USA's compliance with its riskbased capital requirements is assessed. In addition, under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to meet the quantitative requirements for a 'well-capitalized' depository institution, GS Bank USA must also meet the 'well-capitalized' requirements in the table below. GS Bank USA's capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to comply with the capital requirements, including a breach of the buffers described below, would result in restrictions being imposed by the regulators.\n\nThe table below presents GS Bank USA's risk-based capital, leverage and 'well-capitalized' requirements.\n\n|                                 | Requirements   | 'Well-capitalized' Requirements   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Risk-based capital requirements |                |                                   |\n| CET1 capital ratio              | 7.0%           | 6.5%                              |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio            | 8.5%           | 8.0%                              |\n| Total capital ratio             | 10.5%          | 10.0%                             |\n| Leverage requirements           |                |                                   |\n| Tier 1 leverage ratio           | 4.0%           | 5.0%                              |\n| SLR                             | 3.0%           | 6.0%                              |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % The CET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 4.5%, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 6.0% and the Total capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 8.0%. These requirements also include the capital conservation buffer requirements consisting of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent.\n- % The 'well-capitalized' requirements are the binding requirements for leverage ratios.\n\nThe table below presents information about GS Bank USA's risk-based capital ratios.\n\n| $ in millions        | Standardized   | Advanced   |\n|----------------------|----------------|------------|\n| As of December 2021  |                |            |\n| CET1 capital         | $ 42,535       | $ 42,535   |\n| Tier 1 capital       | $ 42,535       | $ 42,535   |\n| Tier 2 capital       | $ 6,430        | $ 4,646    |\n| Total capital        | $ 48,965       | $ 47,181   |\n| RWAs                 | $312,601       | $222,607   |\n| CET1 capital ratio   | 13.6%          | 19.1%      |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio | 13.6%          | 19.1%      |\n| Total capital ratio  | 15.7%          | 21.2%      |\n| As of December 2020  |                |            |\n| CET1 capital         | $ 34,687       | $ 34,687   |\n| Tier 1 capital       | $ 34,687       | $ 34,687   |\n| Tier 2 capital       | $ 6,312        | $ 4,963    |\n| Total capital        | $ 40,999       | $ 39,650   |\n| RWAs                 | $280,877       | $173,442   |\n| CET1 capital ratio   | 12.3%          | 20.0%      |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio | 12.3%          | 20.0%      |\n| Total capital ratio  | 14.6%          | 22.9%      |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % In accordance with the reporting requirements for business combinations of entities under common control, prior period amounts are presented as if the acquisition of GSBE by GS Bank USA had occurred at the beginning of 2020.\n- % The lower of the Standardized or Advanced ratio is the ratio against which GS Bank USA's compliance with the capital requirements is assessed under the risk-based Capital Rules, and therefore, the Standardized ratios applied to GS Bank USAas of both December 2021 and December 2020.\n- % As permitted by the FRB, GS Bank USA elected to temporarily delay the estimated effects of adopting CECL on regulatory capital until January 2022 and to subsequently phase in the effects through January 2025. In addition, GS Bank USA elected to increase regulatory capital by 25% of the increase in the allowance for credit losses since January 1, 2020, as permitted by the rules issued by the FRB. The impact of this increase will also be phased in over the three-year transition period. Reflecting the full impact of CECL as of both December 2021 and December 2020 would not have had a material impact on GS Bank USA's Standardized risk-based capital ratios.",

As of December 2020, this change would have increased GS Bank USA's Standardized RWAs of $281 billion by approximately $11 billion, which would have reduced GS Bank USA's Standardized CET1 capital ratio of 12.3% by 0.4 percentage points, Standardized Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.3% by 0.4 percentage points and Standardized Total capital ratio of 14.6% by 0.6 percentage points.\n- % In December 2021, GS Bank USA adopted SA-CCR, which resulted in an increase to GS Bank USA's Standardized CET1 capital ratio by approximately 1.9 percentage points as of December 2021.\n- % The Standardized risk-based capital ratios increased from December 2020 to December 2021, reflecting an increase in capital due to capital contributions and net earnings, partially offset by an increase in both Credit and Market RWAs. The increase in Standardized Credit RWAs reflected an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity and revisions to certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the RWA calculation based on regulatory feedback described above), partially offset by a decrease in derivatives (principally due to the impact of SA-CCR adoption described above). The increase in Standardized Market RWAs primarily reflected an increase in stressed VaR and regulatory VaR (in each case, principally due to increased exposures to interest rates).\n- % The Advanced risk-based capital ratios decreased from December 2020 to December 2021, reflecting an increase in both Credit and Market RWAs, partially offset by an increase in capital due to capital contributions and net earnings.

The impact of this temporary amendment was an increase in GS Bank USA's SLR by approximately 2.4 percentage points for the three months ended December 2020. The amendment permitting this exclusion expired on April 1, 2021.\n- % Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by average adjusted total assets.\n- % SLR is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.

The FRB requires that GS Bank USA maintain cash reserves with the Federal Reserve. As of both December 2021 and December 2020, the reserve requirement ratio was zero percent. The amount deposited by GS Bank USA at the Federal Reserve was $122.01 billion as of December 2021 and $52.71 billion as of December2020.\n\nGS Bank USA is a registered swap dealer with the CFTC and, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, also became a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC.

Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable for RSUs for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is subject to satisfaction of future service, performance or market conditions.\n\nThe table below presents information about basic and diluted EPS.\n\n|                                       | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| in millions, except per share amounts | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Net earnings to common                | $21,151               | $8,915                | $7,897                |\n| Weighted average basic shares         | 350.5                 | 356.4                 | 371.6                 |\n| Effect of dilutive RSUs               | 5.3                   | 3.9                   | 3.9                   |\n| Weighted average diluted shares       | 355.8                 | 360.3                 | 375.5                 |\n| Basic EPS                             | $ 60.25               | $24.94                | $21.18                |\n| Diluted EPS                           | $ 59.45               | $24.74                | $21.03                |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- % Net earnings to common represents net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is calculated as net earnings less preferred stock dividends.\n- % Unvested share-based awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are treated as a separate class of securities under the two-class method. Distributed earnings allocated to these securities reduce net earnings to common to calculate EPS under this method. The impact of applying this methodology was a reduction in basic EPS of $0.10 for 2021, and $0.07 for both 2020 and 2019.\n- % Diluted EPS does not include antidilutive RSUs, including those that are subject to market conditions, of 0.3 million for 2021, and 0.1 million for both 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Note 22.\n\n## Transactions with Affiliated Funds\n\nThe firm has formed nonconsolidated investment funds with third-party investors. As the firm generally acts as the investment manager for these funds, it is entitled to receive management fees and, in certain cases, advisory fees or incentive fees from these funds. Additionally, the firm invests alongside the third-party investors in certain funds.\n\nThe tables below present information about affiliated funds.\n\n|                        | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions          | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Fees earned from funds | $3,707                | $3,393                | $2,967                |\n\n|                                                | As of December   | As of December   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                                  | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Fees receivable from funds                     | $ 873            | $ 803            |\n| Aggregate carrying value of interests in funds | $4,321           | $5,068           |\n\nThe firm has waived, and may waive in the future, certain management fees on selected money market funds to enhance the yield for investors in such funds. Management fees waived were $595 million (of which $565 million related to voluntary waivers on money market funds) for 2021, $109 million for 2020 and $44 million for 2019.\n\nThe Volcker Rule restricts the firm from providing financial support to covered funds (as defined in the rule) after the expiration of the conformance period. As a general matter, in the ordinary course of business, the firm does not expect to provide additional voluntary financial support to any covered funds, but may choose to do so with respect to funds that are not subject to the Volcker Rule. However, any such support is not expected to be material to the results of operations of the firm.\n\nIn March 2020, GS Bank USA and unaffiliated entities purchased certificates of deposit and commercial paper from two money market funds managed by the firm. These funds are not covered funds under the Volcker Rule. GS Bank USA's purchase price of these securities was $1.84 billion, of which none were outstanding as of December 2021 and $321 million were outstanding as of December 2020. These purchases were made to promote liquidity in the short-term credit markets and to increase the funds' weekly liquid assets. Group Inc. provided a guarantee to GS Bank USA in connection with these securities. See Note 18 for information about guarantees provided by Group Inc. to subsidiaries.",

If not utilized, the U.S. federal, the state and local, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022. If these carryforwards expire, they will not have a material impact on the firm's results of operations. As of December 2021, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $32 million in connection with general business credit carryforwards and $11 million in connection with state and local tax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the general business credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2022 and the state and local tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2023. As of December 2021, the firm did not have any foreign tax credit carryforwards.\n\nAs of both December 2021 and December 2020, the firm had no U.S. capital loss carryforwards and no related net deferred income tax assets. As of December 2021, the firm had deferred tax assets of $270 million in connection with foreign capital loss carryforwards and a valuation allowance of $270 million related to these capital loss carryforwards.\n\nThe valuation allowance increased by $344 million during 2021 and increased by $84 million during 2020. The increases in both 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets from which the firm does not expect to realize any benefit.\n\nThe firm permanently reinvested eligible earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As of both December 2021 and December 2020, all U.S. taxes were accrued on these subsidiaries' distributable earnings.",

A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax penalties was $131 million as of December 2021 and $129 million as of December 2020. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $13 million for 2021, $41 million for 2020 and $60 million for 2019. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December 2021 due to potential audit settlements. However, at this time it is not possible to estimate any potential change.\n\nThe table below presents the changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in other liabilities.\n\n|                                               | Year Ended or as of December   | Year Ended or as of December   | Year Ended or as of December   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| $ in millions                                 | 2021                           | 2020                           | 2019                           |\n| Beginning balance                             | $1,251                         | $1,445                         | $1,051                         |\n| Increases based on current year tax positions | 297                            | 164                            | 131                            |\n| Increases based on prior years' tax positions | 95                             | 209                            | 441                            |\n| Decreases based on prior years' tax positions | (111)                          | (205)                          | (54)                           |\n| Decreases related to settlements              | (80)                           | (367)                          | (125)                          |\n| Exchange rate fluctuations                    | (6)                            | 5                              | 1                              |\n| Ending balance                                | $1,446                         | $1,251                         | $1,445                         |\n| Related deferred income tax asset             | 287                            | 200                            | 279                            |\n| Net unrecognized tax benefit                  | $1,159                         | $1,051                         | $1,166                         |\n\n## Regulatory Tax Examinations\n\nThe firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where the firm has significant business operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect completion of these audits to have a material impact on the firm's financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period.\n\nThe table below presents the earliest tax years that remain subject to examination by major jurisdiction.\n\n| Jurisdiction            |   As of December 2021 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| U.S. Federal            |                  2011 |\n| New York State and City |                  2015 |\n| United Kingdom          |                  2017 |\n| Japan                   |                  2016 |\n| Hong Kong               |                  2015 |\n\nThe firm has been accepted into the Compliance Assurance Process program by the IRS for each of the tax years from 2013 through 2022. This program allows the firm to work with the IRS to identify and resolve potential U.S. Federal tax issues before the filing of tax returns. The fieldwork for tax years 2011 through 2018 has been completed and the final resolution is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The 2019 and 2020 tax years remain subject to post-filing review. New York State and City examinations of 2015 through 2018 commenced during 2021.\n\nAll years, including and subsequent to the years in the table above, remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments.",

See Note 1 for information about the firm's business segments.\n\nCompensation and benefits expenses in the firm's segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm's business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm's other business segments.\n\nThe firm allocates assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, secured client financing and other assets), revenues and expenses among the four business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocation process is based on the manner in which management currently views the performance of the segments.\n\nThe allocation of common shareholders' equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements.\n\nNet earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment's pre-tax earnings.\n\nManagement believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment's contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates.\n\n## Segment Results\n\nThe table below presents a summary of the firm's segment results.\n\n|

These activities expose the firm to many different industries and counterparties, and may also subject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a particular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearing house or exchange. The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring exposures and obtaining collateral from counterparties as deemed appropriate.\n\nThe firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on amounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk mitigants that the firm considers when determining credit risk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral arrangements and economic hedges, such as credit derivatives, futures and forward contracts. Netting and collateral agreements permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and/or enable the firm to obtain collateral on an upfront or contingent basis.\n\nThe table below presents the credit concentrations included in trading cash instruments and investments.\n\n|                                            | As of December   | As of December   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                              | 2021             | 2020             |\n| U.S. government and agency obligations     | $141,191         | $187,009         |\n| Percentage of total assets                 | 9.6%             | 16.1%            |\n| Non-U.S. government and agency obligations | $ 51,426         | $ 59,580         |\n| Percentage of total assets                 | 3.5%             | 5.1%             |\n\nIn addition, the firm had $222.20 billion as of December 2021 and $116.63 billion as of December 2020 of cash deposits held at central banks (included in cash and cash equivalents), of which $122.01 billion as of December 2021 and $52.71 billion as of December 2020 was held at the Federal Reserve.\n\nAs of both December 2021 and December 2020, the firm did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded 2% of total assets.",

Collateral obtained by the firm related to resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions is primarily U.S. government and agency obligations and non-U.S. government and agency obligations.

Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages.\n\nUnder ASC 450, an event is 'reasonably possible' if 'the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely' and an event is 'remote' if 'the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.' Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the firm is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the firm believes the risk of loss is more than slight.\n\nWith respect to matters described below for which management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the firm is being, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers in a securities offering and is not being indemnified by a party that the firm believes will pay the full amount of any judgment, or (iii) the purchasers are demanding that the firm repurchase securities, management has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss based on (a) in the case of (i), the amount of money damages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the difference between the initial sales price of the securities that the firm sold in such offering and the estimated lowest subsequent price of such securities prior to the action being commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), the price that purchasers paid for the securities less the estimated value, if any, as of December 2021 of the relevant securities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into account any other factors believed to be relevant to the particular matter or matters of that type. As of the date hereof, the firm has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for such matters and for any other matters described below where management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible aggregate loss to be approximately $2.0 billion in excess of the aggregate reserves for such matters.\n\nManagement is generally unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters other than those included in the estimate above, including where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money damages, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters are in early stages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory investigations or reviews, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vii) there are novel legal issues presented. For example, the firm's potential liabilities with respect to the investigations and reviews described below in 'Regulatory Investigations and Reviews and Related Litigation' generally are not included in management's estimate of reasonably possible loss. However, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of such other matters will have a material adverse effect on the firm's financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the firm's operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.",

On August 28, 2018, Leissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York of conspiring to launder money and to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act's (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. Ng was charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. On May 6, 2019, Ng pleaded not guilty to the DOJ's criminal charges, and trial commenced on February 7, 2022.\n\nOn August 18, 2020, the firm announced that it entered into a settlement agreement with the Government of Malaysia to resolve the criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving the firm, which includes a guarantee that the Government of Malaysia receives at least $1.4 billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further information about this guarantee.\n\nOn October 22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached settlements of governmental and regulatory investigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA, the Singapore Attorney General's Chambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs Department, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a charge against the firm, one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and will later be dismissed if the firm abides by the terms of the agreement. In addition, GS Malaysia pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was sentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a five-year exemption to maintain its status as a qualified professional asset manager (QPAM).\n\nThe firm has received multiple demands, beginning in November 2018, from alleged shareholders under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law for books and records relating to, among other things, the firm's involvement with 1MDB and the firm's compliance procedures. On December 13, 2019, an alleged shareholder filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking books and records relating to, among other things, the firm's involvement with 1MDB and the firm's compliance procedures. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on August 4, 2021.\n\nOn February 19, 2019, a purported shareholder derivative action relating to 1MDB was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and the directors at the time and a former chairman and chief executive officer of the firm. The second amended complaint filed on November 13, 2020, alleges breaches of fiduciary duties, including in connection with alleged insider trading by certain current and former directors, unjust enrichment and violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act, including in connection with Group Inc.'s common stock repurchases and solicitation of proxies, and seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement and injunctive relief. Defendants moved to dismiss this action on January 15, 2021. On February 3, 2022, the parties reached a settlement in principle, subject to final documentation and court approval, to resolve this action.\n\nBeginning in March 2019, the firm has also received demands from three shareholders to investigate and pursue claims against certain current and former directors and executive officers based on their oversight and public disclosures regarding 1MDB and related internal controls. In June 2019, the Board appointed a Special Committee to consider the demands and, in January 2021, the Board voted to reject them. In June 2021, the firm reached a settlement with the three shareholders. Following the Board's decision to reject the initial three demands, the firm received two additional demands from alleged shareholders (one of which is the alleged shareholder that filed the December 2019 books and records action in Delaware Chancery Court) to investigate and pursue claims related to 1MDB(and, for one of the demands, other matters) against other parties, including certain current and former directors and executive officers of the firm. In December 2021, the Board voted to reject the two additional demands.",

The plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint on October 28, 2019. On June 28, 2021, the court dismissed the claims against one of the individual defendants but denied the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to the firm and the remaining individual defendants. On November 12, 2021, the plaintiffs moved for class certification.\n\n## Mortgage-Related Matters\n\nBeginning in April 2010, a number of purported securities law class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the adequacy of Group Inc.'s public disclosure of, among other things, the firm's activities in the collateralized debt obligation market, and the firm's conflict of interest management.\n\nThe consolidated amended complaint filed on July 25, 2011, which named as defendants Group Inc. and certain current and former officers and employees of Group Inc. and its affiliates, generally alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks monetary damages. The defendants have moved for summary judgment. On April 7, 2020, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's August 14, 2018 grant of class certification. On June 21, 2021, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Second Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings, and on August 26, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated the district court's grant of class certification and remanded the case for further proceedings. On December 8, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On December 22, 2021, defendants filed a petition with the Second Circuit seeking interlocutory review of the district court's grant of class certification.\n\nComplaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 25, 2019 and May 29, 2020 against Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage Securities Corp. by U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for two residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts that issued $1.7 billion of securities. The complaints generally allege that mortgage loans in the trusts failed to conform to applicable representations and warranties and seek specific performance or, alternatively, compensatory damages and other relief. On November 23, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in the first action and denied defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in the second action. On January 14, 2021, amended complaints were filed in both actions.\n\n## Currencies-Related Litigation\n\nGS&Co. and Group Inc. are among the defendants named in an action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on November 7, 2018, and GSI, GSIB, Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited and GS Bank USA are among the defendants in an action filed in the High Court of England and Wales on November 11, 2020, in each case by certain direct purchasers of foreign exchange instruments that opted out of a class settlement reached with, among others, GS&Co. and Group Inc. The third amended complaint in the U.S. district court action, filed on August 3, 2020, generally alleges that the defendants violated federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate the foreign currency exchange markets and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of compensatory, punitive, treble and other damages. The claim in the English action is for breaches of English and E.U. competition rules from 2003 to 2013 and alleges manipulation of foreign exchange rates and bid/offer spreads, the exchange of commercially sensitive information among defendants and collusive trading.\n\nGS&Co. is among the defendants named in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 4, 2021. The amended complaint, filed on January 6, 2022, generally asserts claims under federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy among the defendants to manipulate auctions for foreign exchange transactions on an electronic trading platform, as well as claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of treble and other damages.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Banco Espirito Santo S.A. and Oak Finance\n\nBeginning in February 2015, GSI commenced actions against Novo Banco S.A. (Novo Banco) in the English Commercial Court and the Bank of Portugal (BoP) in Portuguese Administrative Court in response to BoP's decisions in December 2014, September 2015 and December 2015 to reverse an earlier transfer to Novo Banco of an $835 million facility agreement (the Facility), structured by GSI, between Oak Finance Luxembourg S.A. (Oak Finance), a special purpose vehicle formed in connection with the Facility, and Banco Espirito Santo S.A. (BES) prior to the failure of BES. In July 2018, the English Supreme Court found that the English courts did not yet have jurisdiction over GSI's action. In July 2018, the Liquidation Committee for BES issued a decision seeking to claw back from GSI $54 million paid to GSI and $50 million paid to Oak Finance in connection with the Facility, alleging that GSI acted in bad faith in extending the Facility, including because GSI allegedly knew that BES was at risk of imminent failure. In October 2018, GSI commenced an action in Lisbon Commercial Court challenging the Liquidation Committee's decision and has since also issued a claim against the Portuguese State seeking compensation for losses of approximately $222 million related to the failure of BES, together with a contingent claim for the $104 million sought by the Liquidation Committee.\n\n## Financial Advisory Services\n\nGroup Inc. and certain of its affiliates are from time to time parties to various civil litigation and arbitration proceedings and other disputes with clients and third parties relating to the firm's financial advisory activities.

In addition to the underwriters, the defendants include ViacomCBS and certain of its officers and directors. GS&Co. underwrote 646,154 shares of common stock representing an aggregate offering price of approximately $55 million and 323,077 shares of preferred stock representing an aggregate offering price of approximately $32 million. The complaint asserts claims under the federal securities laws and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including, among other things, that the offering documents failed to disclose that Archegos Capital Management (Archegos) had substantial exposure to ViacomCBS, including through total return swaps to which certain of the underwriters, including GS&Co., were allegedly counterparties, and that such underwriters failed to disclose their exposure to Archegos. The complaint seeks rescission and compensatory damages in unspecified amounts. On November 5, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and, on December 22, 2021, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. On January 4, 2022, the plaintiffs moved for class certification.\n\nGroup Inc. is also a defendant in putative securities class actions filed beginning in October 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints allege that Group Inc., along with another financial institution, sold shares in Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (Vipshop), GSX Techedu Inc. (Gaotu), Tencent Music Entertainment Group (Tencent), ViacomCBS, iQIYI Inc. (iQIYI) and Baidu Inc. (Baidu) based on material nonpublic information regarding the liquidation of Archegos' position in Vipshop, Gaotu, Tencent, ViacomCBS, iQIYI and Baidu, respectively. The complaints generally assert violations of Sections 10(b), 20A and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seek unspecified damages.\n\nOn January 24, 2022, the firm received a demand from an alleged shareholder under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law for books and records relating to, among other things, the firm's involvement with Archegos and the firm's controls with respect to insider trading.\n\n## Underwriting Litigation\n\nFirm affiliates are among the defendants in a number of proceedings in connection with securities offerings. In these proceedings, including those described below, the plaintiffs assert class action or individual claims under federal and state securities laws and in some cases other applicable laws, allege that the offering documents for the securities that they purchased contained material misstatements and omissions, and generally seek compensatory and rescissory damages in unspecified amounts, as well as rescission. Certain of these proceedings involve additional allegations.",

Share-based awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensed immediately. Share-based awards that require future service are amortized over the relevant service period. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.\n\nCash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require future service are forfeited, the related dividend equivalents originally charged to retained earnings are reclassified to compensation expense in the period in which forfeiture occurs.\n\nThe firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-based awards. In certain cases, primarily related to conflicted employment (as outlined in the applicable award agreements), the firm may cash settle share-based compensation awards accounted for as equity instruments. For these awards, whose terms allow for cash settlement, additional paid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the value of the award at the time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award.\n\n## Stock Incentive Plan\n\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) (2021 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other share-based awards, each of which may be subject to terms and conditions, including performance or market conditions. On April 29, 2021, shareholders approved the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is a successor to several predecessor stock incentive plans, the first of which was adopted on April 30, 1999, and each of which was approved by the firm's shareholders.\n\nAs of December 2021, 69.8 million shares were available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. If any shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the 2021 SIP or awards granted under the 2018, 2015 or 2013 predecessor stock incentive plans are not delivered because such awards are forfeited, terminated or canceled, or if shares of common stock underlying such awards are surrendered or withheld to satisfy any obligation of the grantee (including taxes), those shares will become available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. Shares available to be delivered under the 2021 SIP also are subject to adjustment for certain events or changes in corporate structure as provided under the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is scheduled to terminate on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders that occurs in 2025.\n\n## Restricted Stock Units\n\nThe firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject to performance or market conditions) to employees, which are generally valued based on the closing price of the underlying shares on the date of grant after taking into account a liquidity discount for any applicable post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions. The value of equity awards also considers the impact of material non-public information, if any, that the firm expects to make available shortly following grant. RSUs generally vest and underlying shares of common stock deliver (net of required withholding tax) as outlined in the applicable award agreements. Award agreements generally provide that vesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement, death, disability and, in certain cases, conflicted employment. Delivery of the underlying shares of common stock is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certain vesting and other requirements outlined in the award agreements. RSUs not subject to performance conditions generally vest and deliver over a three-year period.\n\nRSUs that are subject to performance or market conditions generally deliver after the end of a three to five year period. For awards that are subject to performance or market conditions, generally the final award is adjusted from zero up to 150% of the original grant based on satisfaction of those conditions. Dividend equivalents that accrue on these awards are paid when the awards settle.",

The fair value of the RSUs granted included a liquidity discount of 10.2% during 2021, 10.1% during 2020 and 10.5% during 2019, to reflect post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions, generally of up to 4 years.\n- % The aggregate fair value of awards that vested was $2.64 billion during 2021, $2.01 billion during 2020 and $2.00 billion during 2019.\n- % The ending balance included restricted stock subject to future service requirements of 47,719 shares as of December 2021 and 72,369 shares as of December 2020.\n- % The ending balance included RSUs subject to future service requirements and performance or market conditions of 322,935 RSUs as of December 2021 and 210,692 RSUs as of December 2020, and the maximum amount of such RSUs that may be earned was 387,508 RSUs as of December 2021 and 210,692 RSUs as of December 2020.\n- % The ending balance also included RSUs not subject to future service requirements but subject to performance conditions of 590,453 RSUs as of December 2021 and 489,602 RSUs as of December 2020, and the maximum amount of such RSUs that may be earned was 885,680 RSUs as of December 2021 and 734,403 RSUs as of December 2020.\n\nIn relation to 2021 year-end, during the first quarter of 2022, the firm granted to its employees approximately 12 million RSUs (of which 4.4 million RSUs require future service as a condition of delivery for the related shares of common stock) and delivered, net of required withholding tax, approximately 1 million shares of restricted stock (which do not require future service). Both RSU and restricted stock awards are subject to additional conditions as outlined in the award agreements. Generally, shares underlying these RSUs, net of required withholding tax, deliver over a three-year period, but are subject to a oneyear post-vesting and delivery transfer restriction. The restricted stock is subject to a three-year post-vesting and delivery transfer restriction. These awards are not included in the table above.\n\nAs of December 2021, there was $565 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements.
