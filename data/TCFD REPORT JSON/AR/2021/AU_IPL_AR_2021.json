With a team of 5000 plus dedicated employees, we have a strong safety culture that we're committed to building on. With iconic brands, leading technology solutions and great customers, we operate in the resilient markets of agriculture, mining and quarry and construction. And of course, we are committed to a greener, more sustainable world.\n\nAn ASX100 listed company, we are an international business with world-scale explosives and fertiliser manufacturing, marketing and servicing operations. IPL has two customer facing businesses, Dyno Nobel based in the Americas and Asia Pacific and Incitec Pivot Fertilisers , Australia's largest integrated supplier of fertilisers. We are proud to be considered a trusted partner by customers and suppliers.\n\nOur explosives and fertiliser products are used to unlock resources ranging from gold, iron ore and quarry and construction materials to barley, wheat and cotton. Those resources contribute to new technologies to build electric vehicles, wind turbines and critical infrastructure and play an important role in enabling sustainable food production to meet the rapidly rising demand for food around the world.\n\nThe challenge for us at IPL is to continue to help unlock the world's natural resources while reducing our environmental footprint and working towards a long-term Net Zero future.\n\nWith 60 manufacturing facilities and joint ventures across six continents, including Australia , North America , Europe , Asia , Latin America and Africa , we manufacture ammonium nitratebased explosives and initiating systems, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers, and nitrogen related industrial and specialty chemicals. We have major manufacturing sites across Australia and the US, with key sites in Cheyenne (Wyoming, USA), Louisiana (Missouri, USA), Waggaman (Louisiana, USA), Moranbah (QLD, Australia) and Phosphate Hill (Qld, Australia) - see page 20 for further detail. IPL leverages its nitrogen manufacturing expertise with a global approach to standards and processes, complemented and enhanced by regional oversight and operational discipline.\n\nWe're proud that so many of the significant breakthroughs in explosives technology history are connected to our business. And to this day, we remain dedicated to advanced technology through practical innovation.\n\nDyno Nobel is IPL's leading international explosives and blasting services business and one of the largest industrial explosives distributors in North America and Australia. Blasting is an essential step in extracting the minerals required to meet the world's demand for power, infrastructure and consumer goods. Construction, mines, quarries and seismic explorers use Dyno Nobel products to achieve safety goals and improve operational efficiency.\n\nWe're proud to provide a full range of reliable explosives products from manufacturing plants around the world and extensive blasting services. In fact, we boast some of the most highly trained blasters and technical experts in the industry, and operate in Australia , Canada , the United States , Indonesia , Mexico , Chile , Papua New Guinea and Turkey . Our research & development focuses on practical ways to use new technologies to benefit our customers and include EZShot \u00ae , DigiShot \u00ae Plus.4G , DIFFERENTIAL ENERGY \u00ae and CyberDet I \u00ae .",

And seek out others who understand it.\n\nIncitec Pivot Fertilisers is transitioning from Australia's leading fertiliser manufacturer and distributor to the nation's leading soil health business. Our people, products and services support farming communities and contribute to our growers' production, which in turn helps feed millions around the globe. Resilient, diverse and proud, we are driven by science, innovation and maximising soil potential.\n\nWith a dedicated network of suppliers and agents across the east coast of Australia, as well as our NATA-accredited Nutrient Advantage Laboratory , IPF supports farmers with the crop nutrition insights and products they need to maximise yield potential in an efficient way. Further afield, we sell to major offshore agricultural markets in Asia Pacific , the Indian subcontinent , Brazil and the United States . Some of our leading brands include Granulock \u00ae , SuPerfect \u00ae and our patented de-nitrification inhibitor eNpower \u00ae .\n\nSteeped in history but forward looking . IPL - through its business Dyno Nobel - can be traced right back to Englishman William Bickford, who invented the safety fuse for explosives in 1831. Dyno Nobel founder Alfred Nobel would change the world with his invention of dynamite and detonators in 1865. To this day, we have an extensive Intellectual Property (IP) portfolio with many valuable patents. In recent times some of our biggest advancements include bulk products like DIFFERENTIAL ENERGY\u00ae and initiation systems such as DigiShot\u00aePlus.4G.\n\nOur fertiliser history goes back to 1919 with the formation of the Phosphate Co-operative Company of Australia Limited. Many years later Pivot Limited and Incitec Fertilisers would merge (2003) to create IPL and three years later the Company's fertiliser production capacity more than doubled with the purchase of Southern Cross Fertilisers. Incitec Pivot Fertilisers now boasts Australia's oldest soil testing service and back in 2013 celebrated 50 years of providing continuous nutritional analytical services for farmers.\n\nWith a rich technology heritage, IPL's key technology drivers today are to improve safety, productivity & efficiency, and sustainability. And we continue to invest in the development of new technologies and our service offering.\n\nToday we're also excited by the opportunities presented by renewable hydrogen for our business and our customers. We have partnered with global green energy company, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) on a feasibility study into industrial-scale production of green ammonia at the company's existing Gibson Island fertiliser manufacturing facility. We are also partnering with Keppel Infrastructure and Temasek to investigate green ammonia production at Newcastle and Gladstone in Australia.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have embedded our sustainability agenda into our strategy and established our pathway to Net Zero.\n\nOur business proved resilient during 2021, with our core focus on the safety of our people, customers and communities.\n\nWe reported a 51% increase in Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) excluding individually material items (IMIs) to A$566m. Our Net Profit after Tax (excluding IMIs) of A$359m, is up 91% compared to FY20, as the business benefited from a significant improvement in commodity pricing during the year.\n\nOur Dyno Nobel explosives business has shown resilience with the reduction in EBIT from A$380m last year to A$330m in FY21, largely reflecting the heavy manufacturing turnaround schedule and challenges we experienced with the restart of our Waggaman plant in the US. Pleasingly our premium technology offering is continuing to gain traction with our customers.\n\nWe have been saying for some time that our Fertilisers business is well placed for improved commodity pricing and a strong agricultural season, and this really came to life in FY21.  EBIT in our Fertilisers business increased from A$26m last year to A$268m in FY21.\n\nConsistent with our priority to reduce our net debt and maintain an investment grade credit profile, our Net Debt/EBITDA ratio reduced from 1.4x to 1.1x at year end.\n\nWith the improved earnings performance, strong cash generation and balance sheet strength, the Board is pleased to announce a final dividend of 8.3 cents per share, taking our total dividend to 9.3 cents per share.\n\nThe Board will continue to focus on ensuring we have an appropriate capital structure to support the opportunities ahead for the business, as well as delivering strong returns for shareholders.\n\nWe continue to focus on improving our return on invested capital (ROIC), which increased to 5.8% this year. The business is prioritising capital light, high return investment opportunities.\n\nWe reluctantly decided to cease manufacturing at our Gibson Island facility, after being unable to secure an affordable long-term gas supply. Looking to the future, we're excited about the potential to transition the facility to green ammonia production, which we're investigating in partnership with Fortescue Future Industries.\n\n## Sustainability and climate change have been a significant area of focus for the Board and management team.\n\nOver the past 12 months we have had many meetings with stakeholders, taking into account their views and input. We are responding by accelerating our efforts in exploring opportunities to help create a greener, more sustainable world.\n\nOur first Climate Change Report aligned to TCFD guidelines sets out our long-term ambition to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050, or sooner if practicable. Our short term 5% by 2025, and medium term 25% by 2030 absolute GHG reduction targets (against a 2020 baseline) demonstrate our commitment to decarbonising our manufacturing assets. This will ensure a just transition that continues to provide employment opportunities to the communities in which we operate.\n\nOur climate change management strategy includes a critical focus on leveraging our leading technology and manufacturing expertise to produce sustainable products with lower emissions for our customers.\n\nAs we continue to unlock the world's natural resources, our strategic decisions will be guided by the need to meet our targets and deliver shareholder returns.",

This will support our continued transparency regarding IPL's contribution to a lower-carbon future.\n\n## The strong progress we have made across our strategic agenda positions us well for the future.\n\nIn our Explosives business, our world-class blasting technology DeltaE continues to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint and this year we established a customer partnership to quantify the GHG reductions associated with the use of this technology.\n\nOur Fertilisers business is well positioned to benefit from favourable commodity prices and conditions as it grows to a sustainable soil health company. Our farming customers are benefiting from our soil health services and Precision Agriculture which lead to improved efficiency and effectiveness of fertiliser application.\n\nWe see a lot of potential upside in our business from a step change in our manufacturing reliability following the heavy turnaround schedule that will be completed this year, as well as the pull through into our earnings from the continued growth of our premium technology in our explosives and fertilisers businesses.\n\nWe are continuing to progress our commitment to increase the diversity of our workforce.\n\nGender diversity remains above industry averages within our major regions and there have been increases in female representation at the Board and Executive levels and a talent pipeline build in Management and Professional roles. Diversity, equity and inclusion will be a core priority for the Board and the Executive Team in FY22.\n\nAcross our global operations, all of us have had to adapt to the challenges of COVID-19 during 2021. For the Board this has unfortunately meant fewer opportunities to visit our people on the ground. While we will certainly make up for this when we can, we have continued to embrace technology to connect, including virtual site tours.\n\nThis has given us a great opportunity to gain more insights into the business, our people and our customers.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Board members for their contribution throughout the year, during which we welcomed Tonianne Dwyer as a Non-executive Director. Appointed in May, Tonianne has been a valuable addition, bringing to the Board extensive international experience as a company director and executive working in corporate finance, corporate strategy and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nOnce again, our people have risen to the many challenges of COVID-19 and been outstanding in their response.\n\n## Our people's commitment to live our number one value, zero harm, kept everyone safe as we continued to operate and service our customers.\n\nI want to thank all our people for their incredible hard work and dedication to our great company.\n\nI also want to sincerely thank our Managing Director & CEO Jeanne Johns and the Executive Team for their impressive leadership.\n\nBrian Kruger Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncit\n\nec Piv\n\no\n\nt Limit\n\ned\n\nAnnual R\n\neport 2021\n\n17",

At the same time, we have delivered strong financial results and continued to progress our strategy.\n\nWhile safety is our number one priority, the increased complexity and fatigue associated with COVID-19, coupled with improved reporting discipline at our sites, has negatively impacted our key safety metrics. We have responded by increasing our focus on safety improvements including targeted, site specific safety programs.\n\n## I'm proud of our strong safety culture which is embedded in our refreshed company-wide safety training program, SafeTEAMS.\n\nMaintaining our business continuity and supporting our people has been a key focus during 2021 as they continue to manage the implications of COVID-19 across their work and personal lives. We have increased our global and localised wellbeing programs, rolled out vaccination support initiatives and invested in our Employee Assistance Program to provide ongoing support to our people and their families.\n\nProgressing our sustainability agenda and embedding sustainability in our strategy and operations has also been a significant area of focus and we were pleased to welcome Sunil Salhotra during the year as our new Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer.\n\nDuring the year we released our first stand-alone Climate Change Report which sets out our long-term ambition to achieve Net Zero by 2050 or sooner if practicable.\n\nWe have accelerated our short term greenhouse gas reduction target announced last year and committed to a medium term 25% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, against a 2020 baseline.\n\nInvestigation of alternative hydrogen feedstocks for nitrogen-based products is part of our Net Zero pathway and we are partnering with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) on a feasibility study at our Gibson Island fertiliser manufacturing facility.\n\nConsidered one of Australia's best near-term opportunities to produce green ammonia at an industrial scale, the recently announced partnership aligns with our vision to provide domestic and international customers with sustainable, low emissions products. It also provides the potential to transition Gibson Island to a renewable manufacturing future, following our recent decision to cease ammonia manufacturing because we have been unable to secure long term, affordable gas supply.\n\nAcross our manufacturing portfolio, we will be focused on performance and executing our manufacturing excellence strategy across our high-quality plants.\n\n## We are pleased to report that we delivered a strong financial performance in FY21.\n\nEarnings Before Interest and Tax (excluding individually material items) increased by 51% from last year to A$566m, reflecting a solid performance from our Explosives business and a dramatic improvement in our Fertilisers business.\n\nOur Dyno Nobel explosives business serves two highly attractive mining markets in the Americas and Australia.\n\nFor our Dyno Nobel Americas business, EBIT was down 9% to US$141m, largely due to planned and unplanned outages at our Waggaman manufacturing facility.  Our explosives business performed well, especially in the second half with earnings up 27% on second half last year, as our leading technology continues to underpin growth in the Base & Precious Metals markets.\n\nAs the world responds to climate change, we continue to manage our exposure to coal, with the attractive base and precious metals and quarry and construction sectors now representing more than 80% of our business in the Americas.",

        "page_content": "Our Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific business performed well, with strong growth from premium technology for the first time outpacing the last impacts of our recontracting cycle. EBIT was down A$9m to A$140m as the business absorbed the A$15m impact from the planned turnaround at Moranbah in the second half.\n\nTechnology will continue to drive future growth in our Explosives business as our customers look to improve productivity and safety while reducing their environmental footprint.\n\nWe continue to see strong demand for DeltaE and our premium emulsions, and we are also starting to see the benefits of our technology development work over the last couple of years with new products being used in the field. In June, we completed the first ever underground wireless detonator blast in Western Australia, using our new wireless offering, Dyno Nobel's ground-breaking CyberDet I\u2122.\n\nOur Fertilisers business delivered EBIT of A$268m in FY21, a significant increase from A$26m last year. The business benefited from an upswing in commodity prices which has supported farmer profitability, in turn driving demand across all agricultural inputs. We expect strong fertiliser volumes to continue due to favourable conditions across key agricultural markets on the east coast of Australia.\n\nAs part of our strategy to transform our Fertilisers business into a soil health company, we continue to invest in Precision Agriculture and this year launched a new soil health testing package to farmers to improve the health and productivity of their soil.\n\nFour manufacturing turnarounds were completed across our operations in FY21. This included our first ever turnaround at our Waggaman plant. While we encountered more challenges than anticipated upon restart, Waggaman has since performed strongly and is well positioned to capture the ongoing commodity upcycle. In FY22, we have two turnarounds planned which will complete the current cycle and establish a platform for sustained reliable manufacturing performance.\n\nIn July, we transitioned to a regional manufacturing structure which provides the regions greater accountability and oversight and ensures operational resources are available locally to deliver technical support. As part of the transition, President - Global Manufacturing & HSE Tim Wall left the company and I'd like to sincerely thank Tim for his considerable contribution to IPL.\n\nOur strategy is progressing well.\n\nOur premium technology continues to enable us to grow high quality revenue in attractive explosives sectors and markets, and we are ahead of our target to deliver technology driven earnings growth of 10% by FY22. Our manufacturing excellence strategy is well progressed with our new regional structure now in place, our response plan has been completed ahead of schedule and our investment in precision agriculture is gaining traction in our Fertilisers business.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank our Chief Financial Officer Nick Stratford who leaves us at the end of the year. Nick has made significant contributions to the business over his 12 years with the company and we wish him all the best in his future endeavours.\n\n## It is our people who make our company great, and I want to thank all our people across our global operations for their incredible hard work over the past year.\n\nI have admired how our people have overcome the challenges of COVID-19 and provided impressive service and support to our customers.\n\nFinally, I want to thank Brian Kruger and the Board for their leadership, support and wise counsel over the past 12 months.\n\nLooking ahead, your company is in a strong position as we enter FY22 with our Explosives and Fertilisers businesses well positioned to benefit from the continued execution of our strategy, as well as continued strength in commodity pricing.\n\nWe have strong momentum and the right strategy to take full advantage of the positive conditions ahead.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJeanne Johns\n\nManaging Director & CEO\n\nIncit\n\nec Piv\n\no\n\nt Limit\n\ned\n\nAnnual R\n\neport 2021\n\n19",

        "page_content": "## FY21 Business Review\n\nThe Group reported FY21 Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) of $566m, an increase of $191m compared to pcp. Major movements for the year were as follows:\n\nManufacturing Performance: The $47m net decrease was primarily incurred due to unplanned outages in North America. FY21 production rates in Australia were largely in line with nameplate.\n\nHurricanes: Production at the Waggaman, LA, plant was impacted by two separate hurricanes. In order to protect staff and equipment, in anticipation of Hurricane Ida, the Waggaman plant was proactively brought down and secured. Despite Hurricane Ida being the second-most damaging and intense hurricane on record to make landfall in the U.S. State of Louisiana, the site suffered only minor physical damage. Once power was restored to the Waggaman site, the plant was quickly brought back to full production.\n\nManufacturing Plant Turnarounds: FY21 was a heavy period for turnarounds, with the impact of COVID-19 causing some activity to be deferred from FY20 into FY21. The 4 turnarounds undertaken during the year had a negative impact on earnings of $122m. The planned turnarounds were undertaken at Mt. Isa, Qld, St. Helens, OR, Waggaman, LA and Moranbah, Qld.\n\nAmericas Explosives: $20m net increase (excluding Response Plan benefits and the negative impact from manufacturing). Customer growth (principally in metals), COVID-19 demand recovery and increased earnings from technology was partially offset by a $7m earnings decline from soft US thermal coal demand.\n\nAsia Pacific Explosives: $3m net decrease (excluding Response Plan savings and the impact of the Moranbah turnaround). Increased earnings from technology and premium product sales were offset by the impacts of contract re-basing (now complete), loss of a metals customer and lower international earnings (largely COVID-19 related).\n\nAsia Pacific Fertilisers: $8m net decrease (excluding Response Plan savings and negative impacts related to planned turnarounds and a non-repeat insurance recovery received in FY20). A 2.7% increase in total fertiliser volumes sold was offset by costs related to an increased investment in distribution assets ($5m) and higher depreciation charges ($10m) as a result of the FY20 turnaround at Gibson Island.\n\nCommodity Prices & Foreign Exchange: $350m net increase. The favourable impact of $446m from higher commodity prices was partially offset by a $96m negative impact from a higher average A$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n## Interest\n\nUnderlying interest expense (1) of $107m decreased $23m, or 17%, compared to pcp. The decrease was mainly due to lower debt following the $646m equity raising in 2020 having a favourable impact of $20m. This was partially offset by a $14m increase relating to the buyback of long-term bonds. A favourable movement in the A$:US$ exchange rate and lower interest rates compared to pcp benefited interest expense by approximately $8m and $9m respectively. Interest expense also includes Lease interest, Amortisation of line fees and Provision discount unwind expense.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe Group's effective tax rate on operating profit of 21% is unchanged from the 21% reported in the pcp. Tax expense (excluding IMIs) of $95m was $44m higher than the pcp, consistent with higher earnings.\n\n## Individually Material Items\n\nNPAT includes the following items, classified as IMIs:\n\n| IMIs                                                  | Gross  A$m   | Tax   A$m   | Net  A$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|------------|\n| Non-cash impairment of Cheyenne  manufacturing assets | 107.4        | (28.0)      | 79.4       |\n| Gibson Island gas manufacturing plant closure         |              |             |            |\n| - Cash cost of closure                                | 83.5         | (25.1)      | 58.4       |\n| - Non-cash impairment of assets                       | 102.5        | (30.8)      | 71.7       |\n| Total                                                 | 293.4        | (83.9)      | 209.5      |\n\n## Cheyenne Impairment\n\nThe further structural decline in thermal coal markets has been identified as an indicator of impairment that impacts DNA's Cheyenne manufacturing plant, and specifically the nitric acid production utilisation rates. The future reconfiguration of the plant to reduce Nitric acid production capacity in line with lower market volumes, resulted in an impairment of $107.4m.\n\n## Gibson Island manufacturing plant closure\n\nDespite extensive efforts, IPL had been unable to secure an economically viable long-term gas supply for its Gibson Island plant beyond its current contract. As a result, IPL decided to cease manufacturing operations at the site at the end of the current gas supply arrangements, which expire in December 2022. The majority of the cash costs associated with the closure ($58m after tax) are expected to be incurred in FY23. IPL's Brisbane fertiliser distribution capability will continue beyond the closure of the manufacturing operations.\n\nResponse Plan: $40m net benefit from sustainable cost savings (pcp: $20m). The full Response Plan target of $60m has been delivered 12 months early and is now complete.",

The movement was mainly due to the lower utilisation of trade working capital financing facilities of $80m and increases in the Australian dollar equivalent of US dollar denominated inventory. Underlying trade working capital (excluding the impact of financing facilities) as a percentage of sales decreased by 2% compared with the pcp, reflecting strong cash flow focus.\n- \u00bb Net Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) : Decrease of $143m. Mainly driven by the depreciation charge for the year of $303m and impairment of assets of $213m. This is partially offset by accrual spend on sustenance and turnaround capital expenditure  of $318m and minor growth capital expenditure of $52m.\n\n## Liabilities\n\n- \u00bb Environmental & restructure liabilities : Increase of $81m. Largely due to Gibson Island manufacturing closure provisions.\n- \u00bb Net Other assets/(liabilities): Decrease of $257m. Mainly due to market value movements and maturities of derivative hedging instruments (excluding debt hedges) of $293m, partially offset by an increase in capital accruals of $21m.\n- \u00bb Net Debt : Decrease of $25m. Mainly due to strong cash generation driven by rising commodity prices offset by a reduction in the use of trade working capital financing facilities (-$80m), payments related to sustenance capital expenditure (-$304m) and a $274m decrease in balance sheet derivatives.

The decrease was mainly due to the unwind of derivatives that hedged the foreign exchange rate exposure of the Group's USD borrowings.\n\n| FINANCIAL INDEBTEDNESS                     | 30 Sep  2021  A$m   | 30 Sep  2020   A$m   | Change  A$m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------|\n| Net debt (excluding hedges)                | 1,017               | 1,316                | (299)         |\n| Lease liabilities                          | 243                 | 248                  | (5)           |\n| Trade working capital financing facilities | 332                 | 412                  | (80)          |\n| Total Financial Indebtedness               | 1,592               | 1,976                | (384)         |\n\nFinancial indebtedness reduced by $384m through the year. Net debt (excluding hedges) reduced by $299m mainly due to strong operating cashflows ($730m - excluding $80m of trade working capital facilities reduction) offset by sustenance capital expenditure ($304m) and growth capital expenditure ($51m). Reliance on trade working capital financing facilities has been reduced by over $300m since March 2020 to a sustainable level of $332m at year end.\n\n- \u00bb Intangible Assets: Decrease of $19m. Mainly driven by the amortisation charge for the year of $23m and the impact of foreign currency translation of non-A$ denominated assets of $8m. These movements were partially offset by additions (including goodwill) of $12m.",

No committed debt facilities are due to mature until April 2024.\n\nIn March 2021, IPL cancelled its US domiciled Syndicated Term facility (US$500m) and its Australian domiciled Syndicated Term facility (A$122m and US$109m). Both facilities were due to mature in October 2021. These cancelled facilities were replaced by a Syndicated Term facility domiciled in Australia and consisting of two tranches: Tranche A has a limit of A$490m and Tranche B has a limit of US$200m. The facility matures in April 2024.\n\nIn November 2020, following invitations to the holders of the Group's outstanding notes under the EMTN and AMTN programmes to tender their notes, IPL repurchased US$94m of its US$400m Reg-S bond and A$19m of its A$450m AMTN bond.\n\n## Trade Working Capital Facilities\n\nIPL uses TWC facilities to effectively manage the Group's cash flows, which are impacted by seasonality, demand and supply variability.\n\nThe Group has a non-recourse receivable purchasing agreement to sell certain domestic and international receivables to an unrelated entity in exchange for cash. As at 30 September 2021, receivables totalling $124m (30 September 2020: $116m) had been sold under the receivable purchasing agreement.\n\nIPL also offers suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain financing. The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against several indicators to assess whether to classify outstanding amounts as payables or borrowings. The balance of the supply chain finance program, classified as payables, at 30 September 2021 was $208m (30 September 2020: $296m).\n\n## Capital Allocation\n\nIPL's capital allocation process is centralised and overseen by the Group's Corporate Finance function. Capital is invested on a prioritised basis and all submissions are assessed against risk factors including HSE, sustainability, operational, financial and other strategic risks. Capital is broadly categorised into major growth capital, minor growth capital and sustenance capital.\n\nThe table below includes a summary of cash spend per business on growth and sustenance capital:\n\n|                      | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| IPL GROUP            | FY21  A$m                 | FY20  A$m                 | Change  A$m               |\n| Capital Expenditure  |                           |                           |                           |\n| DNA                  | 24.6                      | 18.6                      | 6.0                       |\n| DNAP                 | 18.6                      | 34.7                      | (16.1)                    |\n| Fertilisers          | 8.0                       | 6.9                       | 1.1                       |\n| Minor growth capital | 51.2                      | 60.2                      | (9.0)                     |\n| DNA                  | 165.5                     | 50.8                      | 114.7                     |\n| DNAP                 | 75.8                      | 25.5                      | 50.3                      |\n| Fertilisers          | 62.5                      | 141.9                     | (79.4)                    |\n| Sustenance           | 303.8                     | 218.2                     | 85.6                      |\n| Total                | 355.0                     | 278.4                     | 76.6                      |\n\nThere were no major growth capital spend items in FY21. Minor growth spend of $51m in FY21 included plant efficiency projects and other projects supporting volume growth and technology investments.\n\nSustenance capital spend in FY21 of $304m was $86m higher than pcp, largely due to the heavy turnaround program in FY21 plus the additional costs previously disclosed related to the post turnaround issues at Waggaman, LA. Turnaround spend across the Group for FY21 was $150m. The remaining sustenance spend was made up of various sustenance projects with the vast majority of project values being less than $5m each.",

Significant movements included:\n\nEBITDA: Increased by $204m driven by favourable realised commodity price movements ($446m) partially offset by unfavourable movements in the A$:US$ exchange rate ($96m). Reduced manufacturing volumes resulting from planned turnarounds ($122m), extreme weather events ($32m) and unplanned plant outages ($47m) negatively impacted earnings. Downstream business earnings (excluding manufacturing, Response Plan savings and non-controllables) remained relatively flat compared with the pcp. The Response Plan delivered an additional $40m of sustainable cost savings, $10m ahead of the FY21 target.\n\nNet Interest Paid: Decreased by $27m, principally as a result of lower average drawn debt levels following the Group's $646m equity raising in 2020, favourable foreign exchange movements and lower interest rates. This was partially offset by one-off interest payments relating to bond repurchases.\n\nTWC Movement: $118m increase compared to the pcp largely as a result of lower usage of trade working capital financing facilities (down $80m on pcp).\n\nDividends received from JV's: Increased by $14m as a result of timing of payments and increased profits from JVs.\n\nRestructuring costs: Increased $11m due to payments against the Group's Response Plan provisions raised in the FY20 financial year.\n\nOther Non-TWC: Improved $15m compared to the pcp largely as a result of timing of payments and accruals.\n\n## Investing Cash Flow\n\nNet investing cash outflows of $342m decreased $37m as compared to the pcp. Significant movements included:\n\nCapital spend: Higher sustenance spend reflecting the heavy turnaround program in FY21 plus the additional costs previously disclosed related to the post turnaround issues at Waggaman, LA.\n\nLoan repayment from JV: Cash inflow of $20m reflects the repayment of a loan provided to Queensland Nitrates Pty Ltd.\n\n## Financing Cash Flow\n\nNet financing cash outflow of $283m was $780m unfavourable compared with the pcp. Significant movements included:\n\nProceeds on issue of shares: The $646m unfavourable movement reflects the FY20 equity issue. No new equity was issued in FY21.\n\nForeign Exchange on Net Debt : The year on year movement of $148m mainly reflects the net impact of the unwind of Net Debt hedges. The unwinding of the hedges was undertaken to simplify the balance sheet and align reported Net Debt with the Group's cash position.",

Outlined below are the major earnings movements during the year for each business.\n\n## Explosives\n\n## Business Performance\n\nExplosives earnings for FY21 of US$127m was US$6m higher than the pcp. principally due to the following:\n\nEBIT Margins: The pass through of higher US gas prices on sales of bulk ammonium nitrate has a negative impact on explosives EBIT margins. After adjusting for the impact of manufacturing outages and gas pass throughs, EBIT margins were 16%.\n\nCustomer Growth: $11m growth in volumes, primarily driven by customer growth in Canada (Gold) and metals mining in western USA. Chile continues to see incremental volume increases through successful trials of premium products. Quarry & Construction volumes in the second half recovered from a slow first half to leave the full year just 1% down on the pcp.\n\nCOVID-19 Recoveries: US$10m from increased international and domestic sales of initiating systems as a result of general recoveries from the COVID-19 lows of FY20.\n\nCoal Volumes: US$7m decline (unchanged from the first half). As forecast at the half year, coal volumes in the second half improved and were 2% above the pcp. This was a significant improvement on the first half where the business was impacted by bankruptcies in this sector.\n\nResponse Plan: US$4m benefit from sustainable operational productivity measures, including cost efficiency gains.\n\nManufacturing: The negative earnings impact of US$12m reflects the previously announced outages at the Cheyenne, WY. and Louisiana, MO plants. These plants recovered well and performed to plan in the second half.\n\n## Market Summary\n\n## Quarry & Construction\n\n43% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Quarry & Construction sector in FY21 (43% pcp). After a slow, weather impacted first half, where volumes were down 5% on the pcp., volumes recovered through the second half to finish down just 1% on a full year basis.\n\n## Base & Precious Metals\n\n39% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Base & Precious Metals sector in FY21 (35% pcp). Volumes grew by 22% during the year with revenues growing 27% compared to the pcp. The primary drivers of these increases were gold volumes in Canada and sales into the metals markets in western regions of the US. Product trials in Chile continue to be successful with volumes increasing over the pcp.\n\n## Coal\n\n18% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Coal sector in FY21 (22% pcp). Volumes were down 12% versus the pcp. with customer closures in the Illinois coal basin adversely impacting DNA volumes compared to the overall market, which was flat year on year. Excluding the impact of the bankruptcies, DNA volumes into the coal sector were down 1% on the pcp.",

Despite the intensity of the storm, the site only suffered minor physical damage. Once power was restored, the plant was brought back to full production as per plan. The negative earnings impact of this outage, and a minor hurricane related outage from earlier in the year, was US$21m.\n\nManufacturing Reliability: In total, the Waggaman plant produced 437k metric tonnes of Ammonia which was 40% lower than the pcp. Sales of Ammonia reduced by 23% compared to the pcp, with shortfalls in produced ammonia being replaced by third party supplies. Gas efficiency was adversely impacted by the plant outages, with gas usage per metric tonne of ammonia produced averaging 40 mmbtu/mt (35 pcp).\n\nPre-turnaround, the plant had interruptions to production that resulted in 4 weeks of total downtime, the most consequential of which was caused by the failure of the regional power grid in the New Orleans area from Hurricane Zeta.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the plant went through its first major turnaround during FY21. The plant entered the planned turnaround with several known maintenance issues, all of which were addressed as part of the turnaround activities. During the discovery phase and subsequent re-start process, a number of unexpected issues emerged including issues with the ammonia cooler, dry gas seals and the induced draft fan. These issues caused a further 6.5-week delay to full production.\n\nWhile the ammonia cooler (heat exchanger) was repaired during the turnaround, the initial fabrication issues prevented a permanent repair, requiring a replacement of the cooler in the next 6-18 months. An outage of up to 3 weeks is expected during FY22 or FY23 to allow installation. To date, the cooler has performed well with no signs of accelerated deterioration.\n\nThe plant operated at nameplate production until it was deliberately brought down to protect the site personnel and the plant ahead of Hurricane Ida. Once power was restored to the site, the plant was re-started and brought back to full production as per plan. The disclosed estimate of a 4 week outage from Hurricane Ida was shortened by 4 days due to a flawless re-start.\n\nPost turnaround, and post the outage for Hurricane Ida, the plant has been operating reliably and in line with nameplate capacity. Gas efficiency has improved to efficiency levels previously achieved.\n\nExcluding the impact of the planned turnaround and adverse weather events, the additional outages referenced above had a negative earnings impact of US$19m.\n\nAmmonia Price: A strong upswing in ammonia prices in the second half favourably impacted full year earnings by US$70m.\n\nDiscount to Tampa Ammonia price: The average discount to the Tampa benchmark, allowing for the one-month lag embedded in sales contracts, was approximately 5% in FY21. The FY21 average discount has been impacted by timing differences in the lost production and the rapid increase of the ammonia price, particularly in the second half of the financial year. 'through the cycle' pricing for internal sales to the DNA Explosives business impacts the calculated average discount to the benchmark, particularly when ammonia prices are elevated.\n\nApproximately 20% of nameplate production is sold to the DNA Explosives business at prices that are not linked to movements in the Tampa benchmark. The remaining sales are priced at the Tampa benchmark price, less a discount that ranges between 6% and 8%, with the higher end of the range applying to prices above US$500/t.\n\n## Other Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing performance in the Explosives and Ag & IC businesses during FY21 was as follows:\n\nCheyenne, Wyoming: Cheyenne ammonia operations were impacted by an unplanned outage caused by a bearing failure on the reciprocal compressor. As a result, ammonia production was down 5% compared to pcp.  Nitric Acid production increased by 4% compared to pcp.\n\nLouisiana, Missouri: Louisiana operations were impacted by an unplanned outage caused by blade failure on the axial compressor. As a result, Nitric Acid production decreased by 14% compared with pcp.\n\nSt Helens, Oregon: Urea and ammonia production from the St Helens plant decreased 19% and 16% respectively, compared to the pcp., mainly due to the planned turnaround.",

Contracts: $3m decrease, final impact from contracts lost in FY18 in Western Australia, in line with previous guidance.\n\nInternational: $2m net decrease. The Indonesian business was impacted by lower demand which was mainly a result of COVID-19. The Turkish business was impacted by a slowdown in construction activity and a weaker Turkish Lira.\n\n## Market Summary\n\nAustralian Metallurgical Coal\n\n50% of Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific revenue for the year was generated from the Australian Metallurgical Coal sector, most of which was from supply to mines in the Bowen Basin.\n\nVolumes from the Metallurgical Coal sector were flat year on year as miners successfully diversified their customer base (primarily to India) in response to bans imposed by China on imports of Australian coal from November 2020.\n\n## Base & Precious Metals\n\n40% of Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific revenue was generated from the Base & Precious Metals sector, which comprises iron ore mines in Western Australia and hard rock and underground mines throughout Australia.\n\nVolumes from the sector decreased 13% compared to pcp, mainly due to the previously disclosed loss of a metals customer.\n\n## International\n\n10% of Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific revenue was generated internationally in Indonesia, Turkey and Papua New Guinea.\n\nVolumes decreased by 30% compared to the pcp. Volumes in the Indonesian business were significantly impacted due to mining activity being disrupted by COVID-19. Volumes in the Turkish business (Nitromak) have been impacted by reduced construction.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nAllowing for the impact of the planned turnaround, Moranbah performed well producing 347k mt of ammonium nitrate during the year. Although the plant was in the last phase of its operating cycle, the plant produced at nameplate (excluding the outage for the turnaround).",

Major movements for the year were due to the following:\n\nVolumes and Margins: Increased distribution volumes more than offset a slight decline in EBIT margins for a net improvement of $7m for the year.\n\nPDC Upgrades: Upgrades to primary distribution centres, primarily at Gibson Island, resulted in increased costs ($5m) being incurred for the sourcing of alternative storage facilities and associated logistics costs.\n\nManufacturing Reliability: $3m net increase at last years pricing, largely due to higher production volume at Phosphate Hill (excluding planned Ammonia shutdown).\n\nPlanned Plant Shutdowns: $7m decrease. A planned shutdown of Ammonia production at Phosphate Hill (aligned with Mt. Isa's Sulphuric Acid plant shut, which coincided with Glencore's copper smelter shut) negatively impacted earnings by $13m compared to the pcp. This was partially offset (+$5m) by higher production of Urea at the Gibson Island plant compared to FY20 which was impacted by a turnaround in that period.\n\n1H19 Queensland Rail Outage - Insurance recovery: The FY20 result included a non-recurring insurance receipt of $7m in relation to losses incurred from the 2019 Queensland rail outage.\n\nDepreciation: The FY20 turnaround at Gibson Island and the FY21 turnaround at Mt. Isa resulted in higher depreciation charges of approximately $10m.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Insurance\n\nRecovery in FY20\n\nResponse Plan: Savings of $25m predominantly from sustainable reductions in operational expenses at Phosphate Hill and Gibson Island.\n\nForeign Exchange and Commodity Prices: $237m net increase, due to higher global fertiliser prices improving the result by $312m (after allowing for a negative $5m impact from tiered gas pricing at Gibson Island), partially offset by unfavourable movements in the A$:US$ exchange rate impacting the result by $75m.\n\n## Market Summary\n\nTotal Fertilisers Asia Pacific sales volumes of 3,220k metric tonnes was 3% higher than FY20 sales of 3,136k metric tonnes. Agronomic conditions have been generally favourable with La Nina rain events increasing soil moisture and water storage levels, producing the highest sales volume since 2005.\n\nThe favourable water levels supported good sales of liquid fertilisers which were up 30% year on year.\n\nGlobal fertilisers prices traded significantly higher in FY21 with realised Ammonium Phosphate prices improving by more than 72% compared with the pcp. The supply and demand dynamic remains broadly favourable to support strong prices in the near term.\n\nProgress on the soil health strategy continues, highlighted by the introduction of Precision Ag and an increase in Nutrient Advantage earnings.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing performance in the Fertilisers Asia Pacific business in FY21 was as follows:\n\n## Phosphate Hill\n\nAmmonium phosphates production decreased to 958k mt, down 2% on pcp mainly due to a planned shutdown at Mt. Isa which impacted the supply of Sulphur. Plant reliability for the year was 96%, an improvement of 3% over the prior year.\n\nAmmonium phosphates cost per tonne was impacted by a number of factors, the most consequential being the increased cost of sulphur. Increased freight, gas (CPI) and depreciation costs were partially offset by Response Plan savings.\n\n## Gibson Island\n\nThe plant produced 499k mt of urea equivalent product, up 24% on pcp. The majority of this improvement is due to FY20 being impacted by a planned major turnaround.",

        "page_content": "## OUTLOOK AND SENSITIVITIES\n\nIPL does not generally provide profit guidance, primarily due to the variability of commodity prices and foreign exchange movements. Instead, IPL provides an outlook for business performance expectations and sensitivities to key earnings drivers based on management's current view at the time of this report.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## COVID-19\n\nTo date, IPL has not been materially impacted by COVID-19.\n\nThe extent of the future impact of COVID-19 on the Group's operational and financial performance depends on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak (including the impact of variants), regulations imposed by governments with respect to ongoing management of the pandemic, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, including commodity prices, customer demand, supply chains and inflation.\n\n## Capital Expenditure\n\nSubject to currency fluctuations, underlying sustenance capital spend for FY22 is expected to be approximately $320m with the final two large manufacturing turnarounds scheduled for FY22. A further $50m of one-off sustenance expenditure is expected to be spent on:\n\n- \u00bb upgrades of Brisbane area distribution assets ($25m); and\n- \u00bb installation of equipment to provide steam independence at Waggaman, Louisiana ($25m).\n\nLand sales to the value of $50m are expected to offset sustenance expenditure for a net total spend of $320m.\n\n## Explosives Technology\n\n- \u00bb Targeting technology driven Explosives EBIT growth of 10% between FY20 and FY22.\n\n## Dyno Nobel Americas\n\n- \u00bb Apart from a potential outage of up to 3 weeks to allow installation of a replacement cooler (if required), the Waggaman plant is expected to produce at nameplate capacity in FY22. The operational earnings of Waggaman remain subject to movements in ammonia and natural gas prices.\n- \u00bb Agriculture & Industrial Chemicals earnings remain subject to movements in global fertilisers prices, particularly Urea.\n- \u00bb Coal demand is expected to decline by 5% through FY22. Potential carbon legislation could pose further risk to coal demand going forward.\n- \u00bb A planned turnaround at Cheyenne in the second half of FY22 is expected to result in 6-8 weeks of lost production.\n- \u00bb Quarry and Construction is expected to continue a slow recovery driven by residential and infrastructure. Growth from the US Federal Government infrastructure bill is likely to take time to filter through to volumes and may not produce material upside in FY22. Volume growth of 3% to 5% is expected.\n- \u00bb Elevated commodity prices should support demand in the Base and Precious Metals sector. Dyno volume growth expected to be slightly above market growth.\n\n## Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific\n\n- \u00bb Moranbah is expected to operate at nameplate capacity post the FY21 turnaround.\n- \u00bb With Moranbah foundation customer contracts having been renegotiated, the negative earnings impact (compared to prior periods) resulting from contract re-basing is not expected to impact DNAP earnings going forward.\n- \u00bb Recovery in earnings from the International businesses is expected but remains subject to customer demand and COVID-19 management within the offshore markets.\n- \u00bb In line with previous disclosure, the unfavourable Western Australian supply arrangements cease in FY22 resulting in a boost to earnings (compared to FY21) of approximately $11m. Investments in capital required to support customer needs and future growth, combined with Moranbah turnaround expenditure will result in depreciation increasing by approximately $6m in FY22 compared with FY21.\n\n## Fertilisers Asia Pacific\n\n- \u00bb Fertilisers earnings will continue to be dependent on global fertilisers prices, the A$:US$ exchange rate and weather conditions.\n- \u00bb Weather conditions across Eastern Australia remain favourable, with many cropping and pasture districts receiving above average rainfall. Increased soil moisture levels in most districts on the East Coast, coupled with high dam levels is expected to drive demand for fertiliser.\n- \u00bb Farm economics are expected to remain favourable through FY22 with farmer cashflows supportive of strong fertiliser demand.\n- \u00bb A planned turnaround at Phosphate Hill in the second half of FY22 is expected to result in 6-8 weeks of lost production.\n- \u00bb Phosphate Hill is expected to run at 90% of nameplate capacity through to the May 2022 turnaround, and at 100% namplate capacity thereafter.\n- \u00bb Based on FY21 realised DAP price and average AUD:USD exchange rate, the earnings impact from the 6-8 week FY22 turnaround is approximately $73m.\n- \u00bb Gibson Island is expected to produce at rates in line with FY21. The forecast costs of closure have been included as an IMI in the FY21 result. The majority of the cashflow related to the closure will occur in FY23.\n\n## Group\n\nCorporate: Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $37m in FY22, which includes investments in Energy Transition ($2m), International business development ($3m) and HR Organisational Development and Diversity.\n\nBorrowing Costs: Net borrowing costs for FY22 are expected to be approximately $104m, due to the impact of lower average borrowings.\n\nTaxation: IPL's effective tax rate for FY22 is expected to be between 23% and 25%.\n\nHedging Program: 67% of estimated FY22 US$ linked fertilisers sales are hedged at a rate of $0.77 with full participation down to $0.725. The remaining 33% is unhedged.Sensitivities\n\nThe table provides sensitivities to key earnings drivers excluding the impact of hedging.\n\nNote: Proxy Index prices are available on Bloomberg.\n\n| Commodity                     | Proxy Index                   | EBIT Sensitivities              |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Americas                      |                               |                                 |\n| Ammonia  (1)                  | CFR Tampa                     | +/- US$10/mt = +/-U$6.6m        |\n| Natural Gas  (2)              | Henry Hub                     | +/- US$0.10/mmbtu = -/+ US$2.2m |\n| Urea  (3)                     | FOB NOLA                      | +/- US$10/mt = +/-U$1.8m        |\n| FX EBIT Translation  (4)      | FX EBIT Translation  (4)      | +/- A$/US$0.01 = -/+ A$3.5m     |\n| Asia Pacific                  |                               |                                 |\n| AP  (5)                       | FOB China/Saudi               | +/- US$10/mt = +/-A$11.5m       |\n| Urea (6)                      | FOB Middle East               | +/- US$10/mt = +/-A$3.6m        |\n| FX EBIT Transactional  (5)(6) | FX EBIT Transactional  (5)(6) | +/- A$/US$0.01 = -/+A$10.3m     |",

Nothing matters more than ensuring people get home safely every day. Zero Harm is integral to the way we work and is essential to our ability to operate as a responsible organisation.\n\nThis year, we continued to shape the safety performance of the industries in which we operate and were guided by our ambition to achieve industry leading performance in occupational health, personal safety, process safety and environmental compliance.\n\nOur strong Zero Harm culture is underpinned by our Zero Harm strategic driver, which integrates the elements of health, safety, environment, and community in one framework. Expressed as four key themes Simplify, Get the Fundamentals Right, Lead and Engage and Strengthen our Learning Culture - they act as principles and provide a common language that guides our efforts to achieve Zero Harm.\n\nOur safety performance is tracked against our three-year strategic plan which targets the delivery of global Zero Harm initiatives and is supported by our global collaboration networks.\n\n## 2021 Safety Performance\n\n## The Total Recordable Incidents Frequency Rate (TRIFR)\n\nimprovement trend experienced over previous years did not continue, with a FY21 TRIFR of 0.87.\n\nIn response to this we have enacted several interventions to reverse the trend including safety stand downs, refreshed Take 5! training, and beginning to roll out the re-designed SafeTEAMS training throughout our workforce. We also identified the need to increase focus on visible leadership in the field and engagement to improve personal safety performance in the COVID-19 operating environment.\n\nOur Environmental performance experienced a substantial improvement with zero Significant Environmental Incidents reported. The achievement of our target performance in significant event management for both investigations and actions completed was also achieved.\n\nProcess Safety Incidents increased with 38 in FY21 compared to 24 last year. This increase is not due solely to an increase in the number of events occurring, but also reflects improved reporting of events. The importance of maintaining focus on loss of containment process safety events, and monitoring progress against completion of process safety improvement plans for both group and business units, will drive the improvement of performance which we are committed to.

        "page_content": "## Our Use of Natural Resources in 2021\n\n## Energy and GHG\n\nThe manufacture of nitrogen-based products is energy intensive because it requires natural gas as both an energy source and a raw material, with carbon dioxide being liberated during manufacturing. For this reason, the production of these essential agricultural and mining products is currently based on a hard-to-abate chemical process. During 2021, we focused on investigating the new technologies required to decarbonise and developed a potential Net Zero Pathway to 2050. This allowed us to accelerate our GHG reduction targets and set:\n\n- \u00bb a short-term absolute reduction target of 5% of operational (Scope 1 & 2) GHG by 2025;\n- \u00bb a medium-term absolute reduction target of 25% of operational (Scope 1 & 2) GHG by 2030; and\n- \u00bb an ambition to achieve net zero GHG by 2050 or sooner if practicable.\n\n## Total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GHG intensity per tonne of ammonia produced\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water Use and Discharge\n\nCooling water is also a key necessity for nitrogen manufacturing. In addition to IPL's comprehensive annual risk management process, the World Resources Institute (WRI) Water Tool is completed each year for long term projections and reviewed by IPL's Chief Risk Officer. While the majority of IPL's major manufacturing plants are located in regions with plentiful natural supplies of water, several smaller sites in Australia have been identified by the WRI Water Tool as being located in areas which may experience water stress by 2025.\n\nOne high-use water site, Gibson Island in Brisbane, Australia, is in a catchment identified as currently experiencing high baseline water stress (40-80%) and this is projected to double by 2030. During 2021, we completed construction of a pipeline to bring recycled water into the site. This will leave around 6,000 kL per day in Brisbane dams for use by our local communities. This underpins our target of 25% reduction in municipal water by 2023 for our Australian businesses. For more details on this management plan, see the Case Study in the IPL Climate Change Report (2021).\n\nTo support these targets, we have identified the technologies and key enablers required to achieve net zero by 2050 and developed a pipeline of decarbonisation initiatives to materially reduce our operational emissions. We have also identified opportunities to reduce our Scope 3 emissions and will continue to focus on these in 2022. See the IPL Climate Change Report (2021) for more details.\n\nOur 2021 global energy use decreased by 14% since 2020 due to an 18% decrease in ammonia production associated with major plant outages. This also decreased our Scope 1 GHG emissions by 14%. Lower plant efficiencies due to restarts increased our GHG per tonne of ammonia by 2% on last year, which is an 8% reduction against our 2015 baseline. Our purchased electricity and Scope 2 GHG emissions remained stable (increasing by less than 0.5% and 0.8% respectively), as did our Scope 3 Value Chain emissions, which increased by 1%. This data is shown graphically below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur 2021 total global water withdrawal decreased by 5% on 2020 withdrawal, to 41,859 megalitres (ML). We discharged 25,501 ML to the environment, 98.5% of which was clean cooling water returned under EPA licence to the US rivers from which it was taken. This brings our net water use to 16,690 ML in 2021.\n\nGross Water\n\nUse 41,859 ML\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDischarge\n\n25,501 ML\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reports on matters relating to climate change are received directly by the Board, and through the Audit and Risk Management Committee and the Health, Safety, Environment and Community Committee of the Board.\n\nThe MD & CEO and Executive Team, develop the Group's business strategy, planning, investment decisions and risk management processes. The MD & CEO is responsible for delivering the climate change strategy approved by the Board.\n\nThe MD & CEO is Chair of the IPL Decarbonisation and Energy Transition (DET) Steering Committee, which comprises selected executives and other senior management. The MD & CEO and the DET Steering Committee are responsible for the development of the Company's Net Zero Pathway and the strategic management of business risks and opportunities related to climate change, including the incorporation of opportunities and key trends into business strategy.\n\n## Building Climate Change into our Business Strategy\n\nThe DET Steering Committee provides ongoing focus and executive sponsorship of projects and strategic opportunities as we seek to leverage key decarbonisation megatrends to exploit new profitable markets in our core geographies. We recognise that the global energy transition associated with climate change is increasingly impacting on our two customer facing businesses. For example, long term growth trends in the mining sector are shifting away from thermal coal towards the metals required for the transition and this is reflected in industry forecasts of commodities demand. These trends have been incorporated into our business strategy through aligning our explosives business growth with predicted customer demand profiles by segment and the delivery of technology solutions to leverage these.\n\nTrends in agricultural markets include not only high efficiency, low GHG fertilisers and soil carbon solutions, but a broader focus on more sustainable growing practices, precision agriculture and soil health. Following the strategic review of the fertilisers business undertaken in 2020, our long term strategy is to grow our IPF business from a leading fertiliser company, manufacturing and distributing a range of domestic fertilisers, to a sustainable soil health company providing sustainable plant nutrition solutions to improve soil health. This strategy will be leveraged through our expansive distribution footprint to drive new growth products and services towards soil health.\n\nThe energy transition also presents new opportunities for business growth for IPL. Australia's abundant renewable resources make it a prime location for the rapid development of renewable hydrogen. IPL has a core competency in the manufacture, storage and transportation of ammonia and is well placed to play a role in 'green hydrogen', and green ammonia for a low-carbon economy. We aim to be an early participant in these new industry opportunities, and we will achieve this by proactively identifying projects, products and partnerships that align with our existing competencies and enhance our core business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Why our Net Zero Pathway is not linear\n\nIPL's manufacturing processes are considered to be 'hard-to-abate' processes. This means that not all of the technologies required to reduce our GHG emissions are currently available. For example, we own and operate six ammonia plants globally, for which no abatement technology currently exists. Since they are wholly owned and domestically operated close to our markets, we have the opportunity to decarbonise these assets while maintaining employment for a just transition, and vertically integrated secure supply chains for ammonium nitrate and fertiliser manufacture.\n\nOur Climate Change Report (2021) describes the work we have done to identify the required technologies to decarbonise and to estimate, as accurately as we can, the time frames in which these will be available for implementation. Based on the results of this work, it is unlikely that our trajectory towards Net Zero will be linear - it will begin more slowly and then accelerate after 2030, with the greater reductions required to reach net zero by 2050 occurring towards and after 2040.\n\nIn line with this work, we have set current short and medium term targets which transparently reflect our expected pathway and are underpinned by a pipeline of actual decarbonisation initiatives. While these are at varying levels of development, they are all considered technologically ready. See the footnotes to the left.\n\nFor details on our Net Zero Pathway see the IPL Climate Change Report (2021)",

In addition, our sites regularly engage with communities and first responders to share community safety plans and emergency procedures in the event of a potential incident.\n\n## Community Investment\n\nThere are two key components of our Community Investment Framework. The first is our Dollar-for-Dollar program . It matches employee donations and site-based fundraising efforts (up to A$20,000 annually) where they align with our Principles for Giving.\n\nThe second is our Workplace Giving program . This is a voluntary workplace giving scheme for Australian employees whereby they can donate to one or more of the company's nominated notfor-profit charities with the assurance that IPL will match these donations up to A$20,000 each year.\n\nDuring 2021, A$440,970 of community investment was made globally through IPL's Dollar-for-Dollar program, the Australian Workplace Giving program and various site-based initiatives, including in-kind donations and employee volunteer hours. 100% of both local and Group donations were made in line with our Principles for Giving, with 7% allocated to improving education, 39% contributing towards health and sport initiatives, and 54% to local community development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IPL COMMUNITY INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nOur Framework preferences local approaches, enabling each IPL business and site to respond to the distinct needs of their communities.\n\nEducation: Providing support for childhood, adult and indigenous specific education activities.\n\nHealth: Providing support for activities and organisations working towards better physical and mental health.\n\nCommunity Development: Supporting activities that enrich community life & enhance the environmental, social & economic sustainability of local communities.\n\nIPL Values: We fund initiatives that are aligned to our values & business strategy, and are integral to the sustainability of our communities.\n\nLocal Initiatives: We support initiatives that help local organisations develop skills & resources to bring positive and lasting benefits to communities.\n\nLocal Sites: We support activities that provide solutions to local challenges & opportunities in the communities where our people work and live.",

Following a regular meeting with the local community, the IPF team contributed funding and volunteers to help enhance some of the land holdings opposite our plant, by planting 1000 indigenous trees to create a wildlife corridor and space that the community can enjoy.\n\n## Dajarra Rodeo and Campdraft in Mt Isa, Australia\n\nThe Dajarra Rodeo is one of the biggest bush and social events in Mt Isa, it attracts competitors from all-around North-Western Australia. The popular action-packed weekend was this year sponsored by IPL and was held with the help of Cloncurry Shire Council and local volunteers. All funds raised from the weekend go to help local community groups in Mt Isa.\n\n## Water Supply Boost at Moranbah, Australia\n\nIn Australia, water supply is a critical issue for many of our local communities, particularly those inland. During the year, our Dyno Nobel site in Moranbah donated 50,000 kL of water from its site allocation to the township's water supply. The 50,000 kL of water is the equivalent of five to six days' worth of water for the local Moranbah community and is worth approximately A$133,000. This gesture was welcomed by the Isaac Regional Council and the Moranbah community.\n\n## Big Grassy River First Nation, Canada\n\nSupporting indigenous peoples located in the communities in which we operate is a critical part of our Community Engagement Strategy. This year our Canadian operations donated over A$10,000 for community development to the Big Grassy River First Nation community of 285 residents in Northwest Ontario, Canada.\n\n## Dyno Nobel Americas Annual support of For The Kids, USA\n\nEach week 'For The Kids' supplies and delivers over 3,000 food items to inner-city kids of Salt Lake City, Utah. Every year, Dyno Nobel conducts a food-drive event where our Utah based employees from Lehi, Tradestar and the corporate office donate Thanksgiving dinner food items to over 300 families in the community. The dinners are assembled and delivered to the families the day before the holiday.\n\n## Cheyenne Frontier Days Foundation, USA\n\nCheyenne Frontier Days is a major Rocky Mountain regional event that takes place in Cheyenne, Wyoming with numerous Western heritage activities and experiences. The Foundation was established to support the charitable and educational aspects of the community and provides scholarships for the volunteers and their dependents of Frontier Days. Dyno Nobel's Cheyenne Nitrogen Plant employees participate, volunteer, and contribute to the success of the event every year. Dyno Nobel donations have directly provided emergency monetary assistance to help volunteers cope with bills during serious illness or accident, death of a volunteer or member of their family.",

Ms Puri (LLB (Hons), B. Com (Accounting), FGIA, GAICD) is a corporate lawyer and governance adviser with over 15 years relevant professional experience. She has practiced as a lawyer for legal firms in Australia and has experience in providing in-house legal, governance and company secretarial advice to ASX listed companies.\n\n## Principal activities\n\nThe principal activities of the Group during the course of the financial year were the manufacture and distribution of industrial explosives, industrial chemicals and fertilisers, and the provision of related services. No significant changes have occurred in the nature of these activities during the financial year.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends since IPL's 2020 Annual Report:\n\n| Dividend type                              | Dividend  per share                        | Total  amount  $mill                       | Franked  percentage                        | Date of  payment                           |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Paid during the financial year             | Paid during the financial year             | Paid during the financial year             | Paid during the financial year             | Paid during the financial year             |\n| 2020 final dividend                        | Nil                                        | Nil                                        | N/A                                        | N/A                                        |\n| 2021 interim dividend                      | 1.0 cent                                   |                                            | 19.4 100% franked                          | 2 Jul 2021                                 |\n| To be paid after end of the financial year | To be paid after end of the financial year | To be paid after end of the financial year | To be paid after end of the financial year | To be paid after end of the financial year |\n| 2021 final dividend                        | 8.3 cents                                  | 161.2                                      | 14% franked                                | 16 Dec 2021                                |\n\n## Review and results of operations\n\nA review of the operations of the Company during the financial year, the results of those operations and the Company's financial position is contained in the OFR.\n\n## Significant changes in the state of affairs\n\nThere have been no significant changes to the Group's state of affairs during the financial year other than the position with respect to Gibson Island. On 8 November 2021, IPL announced that it was unable to secure an economically viable long-term gas supply for its Gibson Island plant beyond its current gas supply arrangements which expire at the end of December 2022 and accordingly manufacturing operations at the site will cease at that date. The financial impact of the closure has been accounted for in the 2021 financial year. Further details are provided in the OFR and note 12 to the financial statements.\n\n## Events subsequent to reporting date\n\nIn November 2021, the Board determined to pay a final dividend for the Company of 8.3 cents per share, 14% franked, to be paid on 16 December 2021. The record date for entitlement to this dividend is 2 December 2021. The total dividend payment will be $161.2m.\n\nOn 8 November 2021, IPL announced that manufacturing operations at Gibson Island will cease at the end of December 2022.\n\nOther than the matters reported on above, the directors have not become aware of any other significant matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the financial year, that has affected or may affect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent years, which has not been covered in this report.\n\n## Likely developments\n\nThe OFR contains information on the Company's 2021 financial performance and prospects for future financial years, and refers to likely developments in the Company's operations and the expected results of these operations in future financial years. Information on likely developments in the Company's operations for future financial years and the expected results of those operations together with details that could give rise to material detriment to the Company (for example, information that is commercially sensitive, confidential or could give a third party a commercial advantage) have not been included in this report where the directors believe it would likely result in unreasonable prejudice to the Company.\n\n## Environmental regulation and performance\n\nThe operations of the Group are subject to environmental regulation under the jurisdiction of the countries in which those operations are conducted including Australia, United States of America, Mexico, Chile, Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Turkey. The Group is committed to complying with environmental legislation, regulations, standards and licences relevant to its operations.\n\nThe environmental laws and regulations generally address certain aspects and potential impacts of the Group's activities in relation to, among other things, air and noise quality, soil, water, biodiversity and wildlife. The Group operates under a Global Health, Safety and Environment Management System which sets out guidelines on the Group's approach to environmental management, including a requirement for sites to undertake an Environmental Site Assessment.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions, the Group holds licences for some of its operations and activities from the relevant environmental regulator. The Group measures its compliance with such licences and reports statutory non-compliances as required.\n\nMeasurement of the Group's environmental performance, including determination of areas of focus and assessment of projects to be undertaken, is based not only on the actual impact of incidents, but also upon the potential consequence, consistent with IPL's risk-based focus.\n\nDuring the year, the Group has continued to focus on licence compliance and identification and mitigation of environmental risks. Remediation works have progressed at a number of sites in Australia and the United States.\n\nEnvironmental performance has seen a substantial improvement with zero Significant Environmental Incidents reported in the 2021 financial year. This result has highlighted the importance of delivering specific environmental improvement plans to achieve sustainable improvement. The implementation of our Compliance Management Framework, with a continued focus on environmental compliance across the organisation through automation, increased controls, and improved practices has delivered significant improvement in our environmental performance.\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, a Penalty Infringement Notice (PIN) for $13,345 was issued to Phosphate Hill operations on 18 December 2020 by the Department of Environment and Science (DES) for an incident that occurred in the 2020 financial year. This fine was issued for the contravention of a condition of the site environmental licence relating to the capacity of a gypsum storage facility spillway. The DES was advised proactively of this situation in September 2020. Construction works to rectify the spillway capacity are underway.",

Both sites submit quarterly reports to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documenting the status of this progression and to date have met all Consent Decree milestones.\n\n## Indemnities and insurance\n\nThe Company's Constitution provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company must indemnify any person who is, or has been, a director or secretary of the Company against any liability incurred by that person including any liability incurred as an officer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company and legal costs incurred by that person in defending an action.\n\nThe Constitution further provides that the Company may enter into an agreement with any current or former director or secretary or a person who is, or has been, an officer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company to indemnify the person against such liabilities.\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Constitution, the Company has entered into Deeds of Access, Indemnity and Insurance with each director of the Company and certain officer's and members of senior management. Pursuant to those deeds, the Company has paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring directors and officers of the Group against any liability for costs and expenses incurred by them in defending civil or criminal proceedings involving them as such officers, with some exceptions. The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium paid.\n\n## Auditor independence and non-audit services\n\nDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte) was appointed as the Company's external auditor at the 2011 Annual General Meeting and continues in office in accordance with section 327B(2) of the Corporations Act 2001. Mr Tim Richards is the Company's lead audit partner for the 2021 financial year.\n\nThe Group may decide to engage the auditor, Deloitte, for the provision of non-audit services, where such services are not in conflict with their role as auditor and their expertise and/or detailed experience with the Company may allow cost efficiencies for the work.\n\nThe Board has considered the position and, in accordance with advice received by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, is satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by Deloitte is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and does not compromise the external auditor's independence.\n\nThe Board also notes:\n\n- \u00bb the engagements for all non-audit services provided by Deloitte were reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer, and where relevant, approved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, in accordance with the Committee's Charter and the Company's policy on the engagement of the external auditor for the provision of non-audit services to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and\n- \u00bb the non-audit services provided by Deloitte did not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Group, acting as an advocate for the Group or jointly sharing economic risks or rewards.\n\nDeloitte provided non-audit services to the amount of $70.4k during the year ended 30 September 2021 (refer to note 23 to the financial statements).\n\nThe lead auditor has provided a written declaration that no professional engagement for the Group has been carried out during the year that would impair Deloitte's independence as auditor. A copy of the auditor's independence declaration is set out on page 85 and forms part of this report.\n\n## Proceedings on behalf of IPL\n\nNo application has been made under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 in respect of IPL, and there are no proceedings that a person has brought or intervened in on behalf of IPL under that section.\n\n## Rounding\n\nAs the Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, the amounts shown in this report and in the financial statements have been rounded off, except where otherwise stated, to the nearest one hundred thousand dollars.\n\nThe Directors' Report, which includes the OFR and the Remuneration Report, is signed in accordance with a resolution of the directors of Incitec Pivot Limited.\n\nBrian Kruger Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJeanne Johns Managing Director & CEO\n\n15 November 2021",

        "page_content": "## REMUNERATION REPORT\n\n## Introduction from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nOn behalf of Incitec Pivot Limited's (IPL or the Company) Remuneration Committee and the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for 2021 which sets out the remuneration information for the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP) and the Non-executive Directors.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's objective is to ensure our remuneration framework delivers outcomes with a clear link to company and individual performance, and to IPL's long-term strategy and values. We were pleased to again receive strong support for our Remuneration Report at the 2020 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Financial Year 2021 in review\n\nSetting financial targets for 2021 was challenging. Volatility in commodity markets combined with the ongoing impact of Covid-19 introduced more potential variability in expected results. During the year, business results were lifted by a substantial upturn in commodity prices and strong operating performance at Phosphate Hill. These factors more than compensated for substantial reliability issues encountered at Waggaman during the plant's first major maintenance shutdown. Unlike the prior two financial years, better than expected economic conditions for our products had an overall positive impact for Executive KMP incentive plan outcomes, as outlined below and in more detail throughout this report.\n\nHealth, Safety & Environment (HSE) outcomes for the year were mixed. Very positive outcomes were achieved in both Environment Incidents and Significant Event Management, however, these were somewhat offset by below expectation results for Personal Safety (TRIFR) and Process Safety. HSE remains a critical focus for our license to operate and ensuring the safety of all employees and the communities we work with.\n\nHeadline NPAT of $358.6 million was a positive result and was driven by strong commodity prices. Whilst the Adjusted NPAT (1) results collectively did not reach threshold, the Waggaman performance outcomes weighed heavily on what were otherwise around threshold across all three major business units.\n\nOverall performance on strategy areas, as outlined in the report, has been solid.\n\n## Executive changes for FY21 & FY22\n\nThere will be changes to people and structure of the Executive Team during 2022. Sunil Salhotra has recently joined in the role of Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer and brings with him deep strategy and planning experience from within the resources sector. A new CFO will be announced in the new calendar year, and the new Manufacturing structure will be settled in time for the AGM. Decisions on the Executive KMP representation for the 2022 report will be made once the final structure is in place.\n\nTim Wall, President - Global Manufacturing & HSE ceased being a KMP on 16 July 2021 and left the company on 15 October 2021. The duties for this role were reassigned geographically to the President - Dyno Nobel Americas, and the President - Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific for the remainder of the financial year.\n\nLong serving executive and current CFO, Nick Stratford, has resigned and will leave the company during the 2022 financial year. Nick will exit the organisation according to his contractual terms outlined in section 3.6 of this report.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nThere were no adjustments to fixed remuneration during the 2021 financial year.\n\nA new regional manufacturing model will be introduced in the 2022 financial year that may result in fixed remuneration adjustments to some Executive KMP.\n\n## Short-term incentive\n\nAfter two years of no STI payments to Executive KMP, 2021 resulted in payments of slightly above half of the maximum levels. This was driven by a stretch Headline NPAT result, a target result for HSE and positive executive personal strategic metrics. The Adjusted NPAT result did not reach threshold due mainly to lower production from Waggaman. The CEO's STI result also was lower than other KMP, primarily due to the influence of Waggaman. For perspective and aligned with the better Executive STI outcomes in 2021, was the Company's share price increased in excess of 40% during the 2021 financial year.\n\nSection 4.1 outlines additional information on the Company's 2021 performance and resulting STI outcomes are provided in section 4.3 of this report.\n\n## Long-term incentive\n\nFor the 2018/21 LTI plan with the performance period ended on 30 September 2021, the performance conditions were relative Total Shareholder Returns (TSR) (weighted at 40%); Growth in Return on Equity (ROE) (weighted at 30%); and the delivery of Long Term Value Metrics (formerly Strategic Initiatives) (weighted at 30%). No performance rights will vest for the TSR component, as the Company delivered relative Total Shareholder Return below the median of the S&P/ASX 100 for the performance period. No performance rights relating to the ROE objective will vest, as the minimum level of ROE performance was not achieved. There will be partial vesting of 50% of performance rights emanating from achievements against the Long Term Value Metrics measures, which delivers an overall outcome of 15% across all measures.\n\nMore information on the LTI program, including the 2018 - 2021 performance, is provided in sections 3.3 and 4.4 of this report.\n\n## 2022 Remuneration framework\n\nEnvironment, Social & Governance (ESG) outcomes including objectives relating to safety, diversity, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions have been included in relevant Executive KMP remuneration outcomes for several years now. This focus will be increased in the 2022 financial year, with relevant Executive KMP having a separate ESG element to their STI measures addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Additionally, the LTI 2021/24 Plan will include a new ESG metric focused on climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in our operations.\n\nAlso, as a result of the 2021 manufacturing performance and the change to a regional manufacturing model, the MD&CEO and the Regional Presidents will have a new 2022 STI objective dedicated to manufacturing reliability for our operations.\n\nWe continue to review market trends to ensure our remuneration framework supports the execution of our strategies to increase shareholder value as well as retaining and motivating our key talent and ensuring alignment with our shareholders and other key stakeholders. We believe these adjustments for 2022 will assist the Company navigating through the dynamic and uncertain business conditions ahead. More information on the changes to the 2022 Remuneration framework can be found in section 5 of this report.\n\nWe look forward to ongoing dialogue with, and the support of our shareholders, and welcome your feedback and comments on any aspect of this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGreg Robinson\n\nChairman",

Executive Remuneration & Governance\n\n## 2.1 Executive remuneration overview\n\nIn alignment with its remuneration strategy, the Board's policy on Executive remuneration is that it comprises both a fixed remuneration component (FAR) and 'at risk' or performancerelated components (short term incentive (STI) and long term incentive (LTI)) where:\n\n- (i)  the majority of Executive remuneration is 'at risk'; and\n- (ii)  the level of FAR for Executives is benchmarked against that paid for similar positions at the median of comparator groups of ASX companies:\n\n## Comparator groups\n\n- - S&P ASX listed companies with market capitalisation between 50% and 200% of IPL market capitalisation.\n- - S&P ASX 100 listed companies.\n- - A select group of 21 S&P ASX listed companies from the Industrials, Materials and Energy Sectors, consisting of: Adelaide Brighton, AGL Energy, ALS, Ampol Australia, Atlas Arteria, Aurizon, BlueScope Steel, Boral, Brickworks, CIMIC Group, Cleanaway, CSR, Downer EDI, Fletcher Building, Orica, Origin Energy, Orora, Qube, Reliance Worldwide, Seven Group and Sims.\n\nFor roles located outside Australia, market-specific data is used as an additional reference point for benchmarking purposes.",

IPL embraces a set of Strategic Value Drivers that underpin the Company's business and form the platform for the Company's future earnings growth and shareholder returns. The company's commitment to addressing climate change challenges and looking for opportunities in the decarbonization of the world's energy systems is at the heart of the business strategy and integrated across all the Strategic Value Drivers:\n\nZero Harm - Broadening and setting year-on-year improvement objectives across key metrics including environmental care and process safety.\n\nTalented and Engaged People - One IPL collaborative culture with engaged, diverse and inclusive teams focused on customers and value creation.\n\nCustomer Focus - Partnering with our customers to create added value and practical solutions for today and the future.\n\nManufacturing Excellence - Driving consistently high performance across all of our assets and investigating ways to address our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLeading Technology Solutions - Innovation on the ground with practical innovations that our customers can use today to improve their operations and environmental outcomes.\n\nProfitable Growth - Focus on opportunities that are distinctive to our differentiated technology, core markets, core capabilities and market segments.\n\nUnder the Strategic Value Driver of 'Talented and Engaged People', IPL recognises that to generate competitive returns for its shareholders, it requires talented people who are capable, committed and motivated. IPL's remuneration strategy is designed to support the objectives of the business and to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward Executives of the requisite skill and calibre.\n\nThe key principles of the Company's remuneration strategy are to:\n\n- \u00bb reward strategic outcomes at both the Group and business unit level that create top quartile long term shareholder value;\n- \u00bb require integrity and encourage disciplined risk management in business practice;\n- \u00bb drive strong alignment with shareholder interests through delivering part of the reward in the form of equity;\n- \u00bb structure the majority of executive remuneration to be 'at risk' and linked to demanding financial and non-financial performance objectives;\n- \u00bb attract and retain the best available talent;\n- \u00bb reward Executives for high performance within their role and responsibilities, and ensure rewards are competitive within the industry and market for their role in respect of pay level and structure; and\n- \u00bb ensure the remuneration framework is simple, transparent and easily implemented.\n\n## 2.3 Executive remuneration governance\n\nThe remuneration of the Executives is set by the Board, having regard to recommendations from the Remuneration Committee.\n\nWhere appropriate, the Remuneration Committee of the Board engages external advisors to provide input into the process of reviewing Executive and Non-executive Director remuneration. For the 2021 financial year, the Remuneration Committee received market and benchmarking data from various sources, but this information did not constitute a remuneration recommendation for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n\nFurther information in relation to the Board and the Remuneration Committee can be found in IPL's Corporate Governance Statement available on IPL's website.\n\n## 3. 2021 Executive Remuneration Framework\n\n## 3.1 Overview\n\nThe charts below set out the theoretical breakdown of the Executives' total remuneration package for the 2021 financial year. The FAR component is inclusive of cash and superannuation only, whilst 'at risk' compensation is based on maximum entitlement that could potentially be awarded under the STI and LTI plans.\n\nThe restricted shares component of the STI (50% for the MD&CEO, 25% for other Executive KMP) must be deferred until an Executive's Minimum Shareholding Requirement is attained.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Executives' FAR is set by reference to appropriate benchmark information for each Executive's role, level of knowledge, skill, responsibilities and experience.

For the LTI 2019/22 and LTI 2020/23, the ROE Growth Condition has been replaced by a Return on Invested Capital (Absolute ROIC Condition). Details of the performance conditions for each of the LTI 2018/21, LTI 2019/22 and LTI 2020/23 are set out below.\n\n## TSR Condition\n\nThe TSR Condition (applicable to each of LTI 2018/21, LTI 2019/22 and LTI 2020/23) requires growth in the Company's TSR to be at or above the median of the companies in the comparator group, being the S&P/ASX 100. This condition provides shareholder alignment as it takes into account the Company's share price movement as well as dividends paid, relative to other organisations comparable to the Company.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 100 has been chosen as the comparator group because, having regard to the business segments in which the Company operates and, specifically, the absence of a sufficient number of direct comparator companies, the Board considers the S&P/ASX 100 to represent the most appropriate, and objective, comparator group. It also represents the group of companies against which the Company competes for shareholder capital. The Board has the discretion to vary the comparator group at any time, including to remove companies from, or include companies in, the comparator group.\n\nThe table below sets out the TSR Condition, and the percentage of the performance rights that will vest based on satisfaction of this condition.\n\n| Relative TSR ranking of IPL                                      | % of performance rights subject to the TSR Condition that will vest   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 50th percentile                                        | Nil                                                                   |\n| At or greater than 50th percentile but less than 75th percentile | Pro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis                            |\n| At 75th percentile or greater                                    | 100%                                                                  |\n\n## Long Term Value Metrics (formerly Strategic Initiatives) Condition\n\nThe Long Term Value Metrics Condition relates to the delivery of significant aspects of the Board approved strategy. For the LTI 2018/21, LTI 2019/22 and LTI 2020/23, the Long Term Value Metrics Condition comprises components aligned with the Company's strategic drivers: Manufacturing Excellence, Profitable Growth and Customer, Practical Technology & Innovation.

For the LTI 2018/21, these details are set out in section 4.4.

        "page_content": "## ROE Growth Condition\n\nThe ROE Growth Condition was introduced in 2016 and applies to the LTI 2018/21. The ROE Growth Condition measures the compound annual growth in ROE over the performance period. ROE was considered an appropriate measure at that time, as it was a widely recognised and reported metric and reflected the levers required to create shareholder value. It does not however, focus on the efficient deployment of capital to the extent that the Board requires currently, so was replaced by a ROIC condition for LTI 2019/22 and LTI 2020/23 (see below).\n\nThe table below sets out the ROE Growth Condition, and the percentage of performance rights that will vest based on satisfaction of this condition:\n\n| ROE Compound Annual Growth Rate   | % of performance rights subject to the ROE Growth Condition that will vest   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 7%                      | Nil                                                                          |\n| At or above 7% but less than 11%  | Pro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis                                   |\n| 11% or greater                    | 100%                                                                         |\n\n## Absolute ROIC Condition\n\nThe Absolute ROIC Condition was introduced for the LTI 2019/22, to replace the ROE Growth Condition. ROIC has been selected as it is a key determinant of efficient use of the capital entrusted to management by shareholders. It also reflects factors that improve shareholder value, including operational efficiency, capital efficiency, asset utilisation and profitability.\n\nThe table below sets out the Absolute ROIC Condition for the LTI 2020/23, and the percentage of performance rights that will vest based on satisfaction of this condition:\n\n| Absolute ROIC Targets               | % of performance rights subject to the Absolute ROIC Condition that will vest   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 6.0%                      | Nil                                                                             |\n| At or above 6.0% but less than 6.4% | Pro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis                                      |\n| 6.4% or greater                     | 100%                                                                            |\n\n## 3.6 Executive service agreement terms\n\nRemuneration and other terms of employment for the Executives are formalised in service agreements. Most Executives are engaged on similar contractual terms, with minor variations to reflect differing circumstances. Each agreement is unlimited in term; however, each agreement provides that the Company may terminate an Executive's employment immediately for cause without any separation payment, save for accrued amounts such as leave, or otherwise without cause, with or without notice, in which case the Company must pay a separation payment plus accrued amounts such as leave.\n\nThe notice period to be provided by the Executives is set out in the table below:\n\n| Current Executives   | Notice period to be provided by the Executive   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| J Johns              | 52 weeks                                        |\n| N Stratford          | 26 weeks                                        |\n| G Hayne              | 26 weeks                                        |\n| B Lusk               | 26 weeks                                        |\n| S Titze              | 26 weeks                                        |\n| Former Executives    | Notice period provided by the Executive         |\n| T Wall  (1)          | 26 weeks                                        |\n\nThe separation payment included in each Executive's contract is capped at an amount equivalent to a specified number of weeks of FAR for the Executive. Ms Johns' separation payment is equal to 52 weeks of FAR as at the date of termination (subject to the provisions relating to termination benefits in Part 2D.2 of the Corporations Act 2001). All other Executives' contracts provide for a separation payment of 26 weeks of FAR, save for Mr Stratford's and Mr Hayne's contracts which provided for a separation payment equal to 52 weeks of FAR (subject to the terminations provisions in the Corporations Act).",

For the 2021 financial year, Group NPAT (before IMIs and excluding non-controlling interest) increased by 90.5% to $358.6m. The financial gate for the STI opened as outlined in section 4.3 of this report, resulting in Executives earning on average, 58.9% of Maximum 2021 STI awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  IPL Absolute TSR is based on 3-year outcomes\n\n## 4.2 2021 Fixed annual remuneration outcomes\n\nThere were no adjustments made to Executive KMP Fixed Annual Remuneration (FAR) levels for the 2021 period.\n\n## Relationship between the Company's performance and Executive KMP LTI outcomes\n\nThe below graph shows the relationship between IPL's Absolute TSR, its percentile ranking relative to its S&P/ASX 100 peer group over the three years that each tranche operated, and the overall LTI vesting percentage that occurred for each tranche. The LTI 2017/20 that vested in the 2021 financial year delivered 0% of the 50% TSR opportunity and 10% of total opportunity available for that tranche.\n\nNote: The absolute TSR for IPL and for the ASX 100 has been calculated using the methodology noted in footnote (2) Table 3.",

The CEO received a target result for Health, Safety & Environment, a stretch result for Group Headline NPAT and no reward for Group Adjusted NPAT. Notwithstanding a strong performance against her personal strategic objectives, the Board exercised its discretion and moderated this component to reflect challenges during the year including the manufacturing performance at Waggaman.\n\nOther Executive KMP also received a stretch result for their 40% Group Headline NPAT component. All except the President - Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific also received no reward for their Adjusted NPAT/EBIT component. The President - Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific received between threshold and target for his Adjusted EBIT component. The main negative factor on Group Adjusted NPAT was the sub optimal manufacturing performance of Waggaman during the financial year. Health, Safety & Environment outcomes were above target for the President - Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific, and between threshold and target for the President - Dyno Nobel Americas, and President - Global Manufacturing & HSE, and Individual Strategic Objectives delivered a range of outcomes that are reflected in the differentiated results in table 4.\n\nDetails of the vesting profile of the STI payments awarded for the year ended 30 September 2021 as remuneration to each Executive are set out below:\n\n|                                                                    | Short term incentive for the year ended 30 September 2021   | Short term incentive for the year ended 30 September 2021   | Short term incentive for the year ended 30 September 2021   | Short term incentive for the year ended 30 September 2021   | Short term incentive for the year ended 30 September 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                    | Cash STI   $000                                             | Minimum share  holding allocation  (A) $000                 | Included in  remuneration   $000                            | % earned of  maximum  opportunity                           | % forfeited  of maximum  opportunity                        |\n| Executives -

The changes reflect strategic business priorities over the coming years. Emphasis will be on aligning to the new manufacturing regional management model being initiated and increasing focus on ESG, particularly the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFixed salary increases for some Executive KMP may result from the move to the regional manufacturing model. This would be as recognition of additional complexity that will impact some roles under this new structure.\n\nThe STI has an adjusted Manufacturing Reliability metric in response to the 2021 manufacturing results and the change to a regionally led manufacturing model. The MD&CEO as well as the Regional Presidents in North America and Asia Pacific will share responsibility for improving Manufacturing Reliability under this metric.\n\nTargeted climate change objectives, previously incorporated within the Strategic Objectives section of STI scorecards, will now be incorporated under a separate Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) category that will extend to all Executive KMP. All Executive KMP will have 10% allocated to this new ESG metric. The CEO's scorecard will include reinvigoration of the leadership, objectives and culture for IPL, particularly as COVID restrictions are expected to reduce. The new weightings for each Executive KMP for the 2022 financial year are outlined in the following table:\n\n|                                      | Financial   | Financial            | Financial                    | Non-financial/Business/Strategic   |        |     |                     |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------|-----|---------------------|\n|                                      | Group NPAT  | Group Adjusted  NPAT | Business Unit  Adjusted EBIT | Manufacturing  Reliability         | Safety | ESG | Strategic  Outcomes |\n| Managing Director & CEO              | 30%         | 20%                  |                              | 15%                                | 10%    | 10% | 15%                 |\n| Chief Financial Officer              | 30%         | 40%                  |                              |                                    | 10%    | 10% | 10%                 |\n| President, Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific   | 30%         |                      | 30%                          | 10%                                | 10%    | 10% | 10%                 |\n| President, Dyno Nobel Americas       | 30%         |                      | 20%                          | 20%                                | 10%    | 10% | 10%                 |\n| President, Incitec Pivot Fertilisers | 30%         |                      | 30%                          | 10%                                | 10%    | 10% | 10%                 |\n\nWith the increasing practical and technological challenges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions both in the short term and longer term, the LTI 2021/24 will also have a new 10% ESG component. This component will target IPL achieving its 2025 and 2030 targets on climate change and focus on investing in new technologies to create other meaningful opportunities for IPL to decrease greenhouse gas emissions in the longer term. Introducing the new 10% ESG component results in a reduction in the ROIC component from 40% to 35% and Long Term Value Metric from 20% to 15%.\n\nThe Board will continue to monitor and consider any trends that may become apparent with respect to remuneration (both domestically and internationally) and look to incorporate changes that may contribute to the efficacy of the Company's overall remuneration structure.\n\n## 6. Non-executive Director Remuneration\n\nIPL's policy is to:\n\n- \u00bb remunerate Non-executive Directors by way of fees and payments which may be in the form of cash and superannuation benefits; and\n- \u00bb set the level of Non-executive Directors' fees and payments to be consistent with the market and to enable the IPL Group to attract and retain directors of an appropriate calibre.\n\nNon-executive Directors are not remunerated by way of options, shares, performance rights, bonuses nor by incentive-based payments.\n\nNon-executive Directors receive a fee for being a director of the Board and Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman of the Board, receive additional fees for either chairing or being a member of a Board Committee. The level of fees paid to a Non-executive Director is determined by the Board after an annual review and reflects a Non-executive Director's time commitments and responsibilities.\n\nFor the 2021 financial year, there were no increases to Non-executive Directors' fees. Fees paid to Non-executive Directors amounted to $1,549,000 which was within the $2,000,000 maximum aggregate fee pool approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting. For the 2022 financial year, the Board has determined that there will be no increase in Non-executive Director fees, which have remained unchanged since 1 October 2014.\n\nThe table below sets out the Board and Committee fees as at 30 September 2021:\n\n| Board Fees     | Chairperson                         | $532,500   |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------|------------|\n|                | Members                             | $177,500   |\n| Committee Fees | Audit and Risk Management Committee |            |\n|                | Chairperson                         | $47,200    |\n|                | Members                             | $23,600    |\n|                | Remuneration Committee              |            |\n|                | Chairperson                         | $35,400    |\n|                | Members                             | $17,700    |\n|                | HSEC Committee                      |            |\n|                | Chairperson                         | $35,400    |\n|                | Members                             | $17,700    |\n|                | Nominations Committee               |            |\n|                | Chairperson                         | N/A        |\n|                | Members                             | $ 8,250    |",

The disclosures for the 2021 financial year do not represent a full financial year.\n\n## 7. Shareholdings in IPL\n\nThe Minimum Shareholding Requirement for Non-executive Directors is an initiative to better align Director and Shareholder interests and requires each Director to hold the equivalent of 100% of their base Board fee in IPL shares and/or rights to shares (that have been fully sacrificed for under IPL's Non-executive Director Fee Sacrifice Plan) at the completion of 5-years of service. As at 30 September 2021, all Directors (excluding those joining the IPL Board during the current financial year) were required to hold 20% of their base Board fee per annum in IPL shares and/or rights to shares. All Directors satisfied this requirement.\n\nIPL's Non-executive Director Fee Sacrifice Plan (the Plan) commenced in 2019. Three six-monthly tranches of rights issued under the Plan has so far vested into shares. The next tranche of rights are scheduled to vest in November 2021. These rights, as well as those that subsequently convert to shares, combine to form part of the Non-executive Director's Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR) that is outlined in further detail in the next section of the report.\n\nThe movement during the reporting period in the number of rights for each Non-executive Director, including their related parties, is set out in the table below:\n\n|                                   | Number of Rights  (A)             | Number of Rights  (A)   | Number of Rights  (A)   | Number of Rights  (A)   | $'000           | $'000                                     |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                   | Opening balance                   | Rights acquired         | Vested  (B)             | Forfeited               | Closing balance | Maximum value of  outstanding rights  (C) |\n| Non-executive Directors - Current | Non-executive Directors - Current |                         |                         |                         |                 |                                           |\n| B Kruger                          | 26,062                            | 44,264                  | (51,401)                | -                       | 18,925          | 53                                        |\n| G Biltz                           | -                                 | -                       | -                       | -                       | -               | -                                         |\n| B Brook                           | 17,374                            | 23,201                  | (34,267)                | -                       | 6,308           | 18                                        |\n| T Dwyer                           | -                                 | -                       | -                       | -                       | -               | -                                         |\n| X Liu                             | 7,239                             | 17,908                  | (15,685)                | -                       | 9,462           | 27                                        |\n| G Robinson                        | -                                 | -                       | -                       | -                       | -               | -                                         |\n\n- (A)  Includes movements of rights acquired under the Plan.\n- (B)  For the 2021 financial year, this represents the number of rights vested during the reporting period under the Plan.\n- (C)  Value of outstanding rights based on 20 Day VWAP - 4 March 2021 to 31 March 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Basis of preparation\n\nFor the year ended 30 September 2021\n\n## Basis of preparation and consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe financial results and financial position of the Group are expressed in Australian dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. Where applicable, comparative disclosures have been reclassified for consistency with the current period.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 15 November 2021.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The financial results and financial position of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date control ceases.\n\nA list of the Group's subsidiaries is included in note 15.\n\nJoint arrangements and associates\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement where the parties have rights to the net assets of the venture.\n\nA joint operation is an arrangement where the parties each have rights to the assets and liabilities relating to the arrangement.\n\nAssociates are those entities in respect of which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies of the entities.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost, and subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the investees.\n\nThe interests in joint operations are brought to account recognising the Group's share of jointly controlled assets; liabilities; expenses; and income from the joint operation.\n\nA list of the Group's joint arrangements and associates is included in note 15.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (including Australian Interpretations) and the Corporations Act 2001. The consolidated financial statements of the Group comply with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) and interpretations. The Company is a for-profit entity.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nKey accounting estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectation of future events that may have a financial impact on the Group and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the subsequent related actual result. The estimates and judgments that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities within the next financial year are set out in the notes.\n\n## Rounding of amounts\n\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument, ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 24 March 2016 and, in accordance with that Legislative Instrument, the amounts shown in this report and in the financial statements have been rounded, except where otherwise stated, to the nearest one hundred thousand dollars.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe Group continues to actively manage the risks arising from COVID-19 on the health and safety of its people and the business continuity of the Group's operations. The Group's operations are in industries that have been deemed as providing 'essential services' by governments and continue to run in line with the required safety and health guidelines. IPL has also implemented a financial Response Plan that commenced in FY20 to deliver sustained cost savings from business efficiencies and improvement of free cash flow by FY22. The extent of the future impact of COVID-19 on the Group's operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the containment strategies imposed by governments and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent impact of these strategies on the operations of customers, employees and vendors.\n\n## Accounting standards issued\n\nThe Group adopted all amendments to Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ( AASB ) that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current year. The adoption of these revised Standards and Interpretations did not have a material impact on the Group's result.\n\nCertain new accounting Standards and Interpretations have been issued that are not mandatory for the 30 September 2021 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group. These Standards and Interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.",

Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue is recognised for the major business activities on the following basis:\n\n- \u00bb Sale of goods and services: revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at the point in time when the performance obligations under the customer contract are satisfied. This is typically when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. The fee for the service component is recognised separately from the sale of goods.\n- \u00bb Take-or-pay revenue: revenue is recognised in line with the sale of goods policy. In circumstances where goods are not taken by the customer, revenue is recognised when the likelihood of the customer meeting its obligation to 'take goods' becomes remote.\n- \u00bb Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.\n\nThe Group disaggregates its revenue per reportable segment as presented in note 1, as the revenue within each business unit is affected by economic factors in a similar manner.\n\n## Goods and services tax\n\nRevenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (other than receivables and payables) are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax ( GST ). The only exception is where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the relevant taxation authorities. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of the asset or as part of the item of expenditure.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income from operations represents gains that are not revenue. This includes royalty income and management fees from the Group's joint ventures and associates, and income from contractual arrangements that are not considered external sales.",

Tax expense is recognised in the profit or loss, unless it relates to items that have been recognised in equity (as part of other comprehensive income). In this instance, the related tax expense is also recognised in equity.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year. It is calculated using tax rates applicable at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised for all taxable temporary differences and is calculated based on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.\n\n## Offsetting tax balances\n\nTax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legal right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nFor details on the Company's tax consolidated group refer to note 22.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\n## Uncertain tax matters\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and foreign jurisdictions and as a result the calculation of the Group's tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgment in respect of certain items. In addition, there are transactions and calculations relating to the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for potential tax audit issues in deferred tax liabilities based on management's assessment of whether additional taxes may be payable and calculates the provision in accordance with the applicable accounting standards including IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, these differences impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Certain long standing matters across the Group were resolved during the year and are reflected in the 'Sundry items' disclosure line above.",

The cost of manufactured goods is based on a weighted average costing method. For third party sourced goods, cost is net cost into store.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial measurement they are measured at amortised cost less any provisions for expected impairment losses or actual impairment losses. Credit losses and recoveries of items previously written off are recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nWhere substantially all risks and rewards relating to a receivable are transferred to a third party, the receivable is derecognised.\n\nTo manage cash inflows which are impacted by seasonality and demand and supply variability, the Group has a nonrecourse receivable purchasing agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated entity in exchange for cash. As at 30 September 2021, receivables totalling $124.2m (2020: $115.9m) had been sold under this arrangement. The receivables were derecognised upon sale as substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are stated at cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year, which are unpaid at the reporting date.\n\nTo manage the cash flow conversion cycle on some products procured by the Group, and to ensure that suppliers receive payment in a time period that suits their business model, the Group offers some suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain financing. At 30 September 2021, the balance of the supply chain finance program was $207.9m (2020: $296.4m). The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to have the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as borrowings. These indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary payment terms in the industry. At 30 September 2021, the Group has assessed that on balance the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements did not meet all of the characteristics to be classified as borrowings and accordingly the balances remained in trade and other payables.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Shareholder returns\n\nFor the year ended 30 September 2021\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nThe expected impairment loss calculation for trade receivables considers the impact of past events, and exercises judgment over the impact of current and future economic conditions when considering the recoverability of outstanding trade receivable balances at the reporting date. In establishing the expected impairment loss provision, the Group also assessed the impact of COVID-19 and its potential to affect customers' repayment ability. Subsequent changes in economic and market conditions may result in the provision for impairment losses increasing or decreasing in future periods.\n\n## 5.

The record date for entitlement to this dividend is 2 December 2021. The total dividend payment will be $161.2m.\n\nThe financial effect of this dividend has not been recognised in the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognised in subsequent Financial Reports.\n\nThe dividend reflects a payout ratio of approximately 50 percent of net profit after tax (before individually material items).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Capital structure\n\n## For the year ended 30 September 2021\n\n## Franking credits\n\nFranking credits available to shareholders of the Company were $10.1m (2020: $8.9m).\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\nA provision for dividends payable is recognised in the reporting period in which the dividends are paid. The provision is for the total undistributed dividend amount, regardless of the extent to which the dividend will be paid in cash.\n\n## 7. Capital management\n\nCapital is defined as the amount subscribed by shareholders to the Company's ordinary shares and amounts advanced by debt providers to any Group entity. The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern while providing returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.\n\nThe Group's key strategies for maintenance of an optimal capital structure include:\n\n- \u00bb Aiming to maintain an investment grade credit profile and the requisite financial metrics.\n- \u00bb Securing access to diversified sources of debt funding with a spread of maturity dates and sufficient undrawn committed facility capacity.\n- \u00bb Optimising over the long term, to the extent practicable, the Group's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), while maintaining financial flexibility.\n\nIn order to optimise its capital structure, the Group may undertake one or a combination of the following actions:\n\n- \u00bb change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and/or offer a dividend reinvestment plan with or without a discount and/or with or without an underwriting facility when appropriate;\n- \u00bb return capital or issue new shares to shareholders;\n- \u00bb vary discretionary capital expenditure;\n- \u00bb raise new debt funding or repay existing debt balances; and\n- \u00bb draw down additional debt or sell non-core assets to reduce debt.\n\n## Key financial metrics\n\nThe Group uses a range of financial metrics to monitor the efficiency of its capital structure, including EBITDA interest cover and Net debt/ EBITDA before individually material items. Financial metric targets are maintained inside debt covenant restrictions. At 30 September the Group's position in relation to these metrics was:\n\n|                         | Target range           |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net debt/EBITDA (times) | equal or less than 2.5 |    1.1 |    1.4 |\n| Interest cover (times)  | equal or more than 6.0 |    9.7 |    6.1 |\n\nThese ratios are impacted by a number of factors, including the level of cash retained from operating cash flows generated by the Group after paying all of its commitments (including dividends or other returns of capital), movements in foreign exchange rates, changes to market interest rates and the fair value of hedges economically hedging the Group's net debt.\n\n## Self-insurance\n\nThe Group also self-insures for certain insurance risks under the Singapore Insurance Act. Under this Act, authorised general insurer, Coltivi Insurance Pte Limited (the Group's self-insurance company), is required to maintain a minimum amount of capital. For the financial year ended 30 September 2021, Coltivi Insurance Pte Limited maintained capital in excess of the minimum requirements prescribed under this Act.\n\n## Issued capital\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nOrdinary shares issued are classified as equity and are fully paid, have no par value and carry one vote per share and the right to dividends. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax benefit.\n\nIssued capital as at 30 September 2021 amounted to $3,806.2m (1,942,225,029 ordinary shares).",

Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with any difference between cost and redemption value recognised in the profit or loss over the period of the borrowings.\n\nThe Group derecognises interest bearing liabilities when its obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Any gains and losses arising on derecognition are recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities are classified as current liabilities, except for those liabilities where the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the year end, which are classified as non-current.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash includes cash at bank, cash on hand and short term investments, net of bank overdrafts.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs include interest on borrowings and the amortisation of premiums relating to borrowings.\n\nBorrowing costs are expensed as incurred, unless they relate to qualifying assets (refer note 9). In this instance, the borrowing costs are capitalised and depreciated over the asset's expected useful life.",

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nBorrowing costs in relation to the funding of qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the cost of the asset. Qualifying assets are assets that take more than 12 months to get ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds are borrowed, generally a weighted average interest rate is used for the capitalisation of interest.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is subject to impairment testing. For details of impairment of assets, refer note 12.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis. Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation rates are calculated to spread the cost of the asset (less any residual value), over its estimated useful life. Residual value is the estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.\n\nEstimated useful lives for each class of asset are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Buildings and improvements\n\n20 - 50 years\n\n- \u00bb Machinery, plant and equipment\n\n3 - 50 years\n\nResidual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted where relevant when changes in circumstances impact the use of the asset.",

Short term (12 months or less) and low value leases are recognised in the profit or loss as a lease expense.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis in the profit or loss over the lease term.\n\nLease liabilities are recognised by the Group at the commencement date of the lease and are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Lease payments include fixed payments and variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nExtension options - The Group considers whether an option to extend a lease is reasonably certain on a lease-by-lease basis, which considers the importance of the lease to the Group's operations and its economic incentive to extend the lease. The lease term is reassessed upon the occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstance.\n\nIncremental borrowing rate - To calculate the present value of lease payments, the Group uses an incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the duration and the financing characteristics of the lease. Where the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily available, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate applicable to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics.",

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\n\n## Brand names\n\nBrand names acquired by the Group have indefinite useful lives and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment. They are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets acquired by the Group have finite lives.\n\nThey are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\n\n## Subsequent expenditure\n\nSubsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits of the asset to which it relates. All other such expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\n## Amortisation\n\nGoodwill and brand names are not amortised.\n\nFor intangible assets with finite lives, amortisation is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets in this category are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Software\n- 3 - 10 years\n- \u00bb\n- Product trademarks 4 - 10 years\n- \u00bb Patents\n\n13 - 15 years\n\n- \u00bb Customer contracts 10 - 17 years\n\nUseful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted where relevant.\n\n## 12. Impairment of goodwill and noncurrent assets\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill\n\nThe Group performs annual impairment testing as at 30 September for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. More frequent reviews are performed for indicators of impairment of all the Group's assets, including operating assets.\n\nSince 30 September 2020, the Group announced the impact of the extension of turnaround activities and one-off outages at some of its US manufacturing facilities. In addition, the Group is actively managing the risks arising from COVID-19. To date there are no known significant long term structural changes that affect the future cash flows of the CGUs as a result of these events. As a result, the recoverable amounts of IPL's CGUs continued to exceed their carrying amounts at 30 September 2021.\n\n## Impairment testing of assets\n\n## DNA Cheyenne manufacturing plant\n\nThe further structural decline in thermal coal markets has been identified as an indicator of impairment that impacts DNA's Cheyenne manufacturing plant, and specifically the nitric acid production utilisation rates. The future reconfiguration of the plant to reduce Nitric acid production capacity in line with lower market volumes, resulted in an impairment of $107.4m.\n\n## Gibson Island\n\nIPL was unable to secure an economically viable long-term gas supply for its Gibson Island plant beyond its current contract. As a result, IPL decided to cease manufacturing operations at the site at the end of the current gas supply arrangements which expire in December 2022. IPL's Brisbane fertiliser distribution capability will continue beyond the closure of the manufacturing operations.\n\nThe financial impact of the closure of the manufacturing operations are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Cash costs of closure: $83.5m (pre-tax);\n- \u00bb Non-cash impairment of assets: $102.5m.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nDetails of the key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations at 30 September are set out below:\n\n| Key assumptions   | 1 - 5 years   | 1 - 5 years   | Terminal value   (after 5 years)   | Terminal value   (after 5 years)   |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                   | 2021          | 2020          | 2021                               | 2020                               |\n|                   | US$           | US$           | US$                                | US$                                |\n| DAP (1)           | 427 to 541    | 330 to 441    | 520                                | 510                                |\n| Gas (DNA CGU) (2) | 3.00 to 3.50  | 2.46 to 2.95  | 3.50                               | 3.21                               |\n| Ammonia (3)       | 356 to 480    | 252 to 315    | 454                                | 435                                |\n| AUD:USD (4)       | 0.74 to 0.76  | 0.73 to 0.74  | 0.74                               | 0.72                               |\n\n- (3)  Ammonia price (CFR Tampa - USD per tonne).\n\nFor both DNAP and Fertilisers APAC, the gas price assumption for impairment testing purposes for the period after the current gas contracts expire, is based on external long term gas production cost forecasts of between $6.90 and $8.00 per gigajoule.\n\nFertiliser prices, foreign exchange rates and natural gas prices are estimated by reference to external market publications and market analyst estimates, and are updated at each reporting date.\n\n## Discount and growth rates\n\nThe post-tax discount rate used in the calculations is 9% for the Fertilisers APAC CGU (2020: 9%) and 8.5% for the DNA and DNAP CGUs (2020: 8.5%). The rate reflects the underlying cost of capital adjusted for market and asset specific risks.\n\nThe terminal value growth rate represents the forecast consumer price index (CPI) of 2.5% (2020: 2.5%) for all CGUs.

More frequent reviews are performed for indicators of impairment of all the Group's assets, including operating assets. The identification of impairment indicators involves management judgment. Where an indicator of impairment is identified, a formal impairment assessment is performed. The Group's annual impairment testing determines whether the recoverable amount of a CGU or group of CGUs, to which goodwill and/or indefinite life intangible assets are allocated, exceeds its carrying amount.\n\nA CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash flows largely independent of cash flows of other groups of assets. Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs which are no larger than one of the Group's reportable segments.\n\n## Determining the recoverable amount\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is determined as the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is a term that means an asset's value based on the expected future cash flows arising from its continued use in its current condition, discounted to present value. For discounting purposes, a post-tax rate is used that reflects current market assessments of the risks specific to the asset. The Group has prepared value-in-use models for the purpose of impairment testing as at 30 September 2021, using five year discounted cash flow models based on Board approved forecasts. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a terminal value growth rate.\n\nTransition of the world's energy systems and sustainability forms part of our strategy and these have been considered in the market data utilised to assess growth rates for each CGU.\n\n## Impairment losses\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset (or its CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nImpairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated against assets in the following order:\n\n- \u00bb Firstly, against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU.\n- \u00bb Secondly, against the carrying amount of any remaining assets in the CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss recognised in a prior period for an asset (or its CGU) other than goodwill may be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset (or its CGU) since the last impairment loss was recognised. When this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset (or its CGU) is increased to its recoverable amount.",

This estimate is based on a 'present value' calculation, which involves the application of a discount rate to the expected future cash flows associated with settlement. The discount rate takes into account factors such as risks specific to the liability and the time value of money.\n\n## Employee entitlements\n\nProvisions are made for liabilities to employees for annual leave, long service leave and other employee entitlements. Where the payment to employees is expected to take place in 12 months time or later, a present value calculation is performed. In this instance, the corporate bond rate is used to discount the liability to its present value.\n\n## Restructuring and rationalisation\n\nProvisions for restructuring or rationalisation are only recognised when a detailed plan has been approved and the restructuring or rationalisation has either commenced or been publicly announced.\n\n## Environmental\n\nProvisions relating to the remediation of soil, groundwater, untreated waste and other environmental contamination are made when the Group has an obligation to carry out the clean-up operation as a result of a past event. In addition, a provision will only be made where it is possible to reliably estimate the costs involved.\n\n## Asset retirement\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove an asset and to restore the site on which it is located. The present value of the estimated costs of this process is recognised as part of the asset that is depreciated and also as a provision.\n\nAt each reporting date, the provision is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates and the timing and amount of future estimated cash flows. Any changes in the provision are added to or deducted from the related asset, other than changes associated with the passage of time. This is recognised as a borrowing cost in the profit or loss.\n\n## Legal and other\n\nThere are a number of legal claims and other exposures, including claims for damages arising from products and services supplied by the Group, that arise from the ordinary course of business. A provision is only made where it is probable that a payment or restitution will be required and the costs involved can be reliably estimated.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nProvisions are based on the Group's estimate of the timing and value of outflows of resources required to settle or satisfy commitments and liabilities known to the Group at the reporting date.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe following contingent liabilities are considered unlikely. However the directors consider they should be disclosed:\n\n- \u00bb Under the terms of the ASIC Legislative Instrument, ASIC Corporations (Wholly-owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 17 December 2016, which relieved certain wholly-owned subsidiaries from the requirement to prepare audited financial statements, IPL and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (identified in note 15) have entered into an approved deed for the cross guarantee of liabilities. No additional liabilities subject to the Deed of Cross Guarantee at 30 September 2021 are expected to arise to IPL or the relevant subsidiaries.\n- \u00bb The Group is regularly subject to investigations and audit activities by the revenue authorities of jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The outcome of these investigations and audits depends upon several factors which may result in further tax payments or refunds of tax payments already made by the Group over and above existing provisions. Refer to note 3 for further details.\n- \u00bb Contingent liabilities arise in the normal course of business and include a number of legal claims, environmental cleanup requirements and bank guarantees.\n\nThe Directors are of the opinion that no additional provisions are required in respect of these matters, as it is either not probable that a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required or the amount is not capable of reliable measurement.",

Financial risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk. This note explains the Group's financial risk exposures and its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks.\n\nThe Board of Directors (the Board ) has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Board established the Audit and Risk Management Committee ( ARMC ) which is responsible for, amongst other things, the monitoring of the Group's risk management plans. The ARMC is assisted in its oversight role by the Group's Risk Management function. The Risk Management function performs reviews of the Group's risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the ARMC. The ARMC reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\n\nThe Group's financial risk management framework includes policies to identify, analyse and manage the Group's financial risks. These policies set appropriate financial risk limits and controls, identify permitted derivative instruments and provide guidance on how to monitor and report financial risks and adherence to set limits. Financial risk management policies, procedures and systems are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain appropriate given changes in market conditions and/or the Group's activities.\n\n## Financial risks\n\n## Liquidity risk: The risk that the Group is not able to refinance its debt obligations or meet other cash outflow obligations when required.\n\n## Source of risk\n\nExposure to liquidity risk derives from the Group's operations and from the external interest bearing liabilities that it holds.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nLiquidity risk is managed by ensuring there are sufficient committed funding facilities available to meet the Group's financial commitments in a timely manner.\n\nThe Group's forecast liquidity requirements are continually reassessed based on regular forecasting of earnings and capital requirements.\n\n## Outstanding financial instruments\n\nThe Group's exposures to liquidity risk are set out in the tables below:\n\n| 30 September 2021                          | Contractual  cash flows (1) $mill   | 0 -

However, in some instances price risk exposure cannot be economically mitigated by either contractual arrangements or derivative contracts by virtue of the products that the Group sells.\n\n## Sensitivity to natural gas price movements during the year\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of the Group's profit before tax to a change of US$1 per MMBTU in the US Henry Hub natural gas price.

Credit limits are established and monitored for each customer, and these limits represent the highest level of exposure that a customer can reach. Trade credit insurance is purchased when required.\n\nThe Group mitigates credit risk from financial instrument contracts by only entering into transactions with counterparties that have sound credit ratings and, where applicable, with whom the Group has a signed netting agreement. Given their high credit ratings, the Group does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities is calculated using a variety of techniques depending on the type of financial instrument as follows:\n\n- \u00bb The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities traded in active markets (such as equity securities and fixed interest rate bonds) is the quoted market price at the reporting date.\n- \u00bb The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities not traded in active markets is calculated using discounted cash flows. Future cash flows are calculated based on observable forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n- \u00bb The fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward contracts is calculated using discounted cash flows, reflecting the credit risk of various counterparties. Future cash flows are calculated based on the contract rate, observable forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n- \u00bb The fair value of option contracts is calculated using the contract rates and observable market rates at the end of the reporting period, reflecting the credit risk of various counterparties. The valuation technique is consistent with the Black-Scholes methodology and utilises Monte Carlo simulations.\n- \u00bb The fair value of commodity swaps and commodity forward contracts is calculated using their quoted market price, where available. If a quoted market price is not available, then fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on the difference between the contractual price and the current observable market price, reflecting the credit risk of various counterparties. These future cash flows are then discounted to present value.\n- \u00bb The nominal value less expected credit losses of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short term maturity.\n\n## Credit risk exposure\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 September is the carrying amount, net of any provision for impairment, of the financial assets as detailed in the table below:\n\n|                             | 2021   $mill   | 2020   $mill   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Trade and other receivables | 517.0          | 400.8          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   | 651.8          | 554.6          |\n| Derivative assets           | 86.0           | 132.9          |\n|                             | 1,254.8        | 1,088.3        |\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and are intended to be settled on a net basis are offset in the Statement of Financial Position. At 30 September 2021, the amount netted in other financial assets and other financial liabilities is nil (2020: $382.1m).\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00bb Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- \u00bb Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n| 2021                             | Level 1  $mill   | Level 2   $mill   | Level 3  $mill   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Derivative financial assets      | -                | 86.0              | -                |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | -                | (93.5)            | -                |\n| Investment in Equity Instrument  | -                | -                 | 3.0              |\n| 2020                             | Level 1  $mill   | Level 2   $mill   | Level 3  $mill   |\n| Derivative financial assets      | -                | 132.9             | -                |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | -                | (158.9)           | -                |\n| Investment in Equity Instrument  | -                | -                 | 3.0              |\n\nFair value of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\n\nCash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost which equals their fair value.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities are carried at amortised cost and have a carrying value of $1,668.8m (2020: $1,870.3m) - refer to note 8. The fair value of the interest bearing financial liabilities at 30 September 2021 was $1,763.5m (2020: $1,949.2m) and was based on the level 2 valuation methodology.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Risk management\n\n## For the year ended 30 September 2021\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nThe Group presents its accounts in Australian dollars. Foreign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the date the transaction occurs.\n\nMonetary assets (such as trade receivables) and liabilities (such as trade creditors) denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rate at 30 September. Non-monetary items (for example, plant and machinery) that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses relating to transactions are recognised in the profit or loss with the exception of gains and losses arising from cash flow hedges and net investment hedges that are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated at applicable exchange rates at 30 September. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising on translation are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve ( FCTR ). If and when the Group disposes of the foreign operation, these gains and losses are transferred from the FCTR to the profit or loss.\n\n## Derivatives and hedging\n\nThe Group uses contracts known as derivative financial instruments to hedge its financial risk exposures.\n\nOn entering into a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents details of the hedge, risk management objective and strategy for entering into the arrangement. The Group applies hedge accounting to hedging relationships that are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value, i.e. where the cash flows arising from the hedge instrument closely match the cash flows arising from the hedged item.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when:\n\n- \u00bb The hedging relationship no longer meets the risk management objective.\n- \u00bb The hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n- \u00bb The hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nDerivatives are measured at fair value. The accounting treatment applied to specific types of hedges is set out below.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognised in equity, in the cash flow hedge reserve. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nFair value gains or losses accumulated in the reserve are taken to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in the reserve is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is purchased.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are accounted for in a similar way as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of the hedge are recognised directly in equity (in the FCTR) while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nOn disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of gains or losses recognised in the FCTR are transferred to profit or loss.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item are recognised in the profit or loss.\n\n## Hedge ineffectiveness\n\nThe Group aims to transact only highly effective hedge relationships, and in most cases the hedging instruments have a 1:1 hedge ratio with the hedged items. However, at times, some hedge ineffectiveness can arise and is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it occurs. Key sources of hedge ineffectiveness for the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Maturity dates of hedging instruments not matching the maturity dates of the hedged items.\n- \u00bb Credit risk inherent within the hedging instrument not matching the movement in the hedged item.\n- \u00bb Interest rates of the Group's financing facilities not matching the interest rates of the hedging instrument.\n- \u00bb Forecast transactions not occurring.\n\n## Classification of financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are classified into the following categories:\n\n- \u00bb Amortised cost (cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing liabilities and trade and other receivables and payables).\n- \u00bb Fair value through other comprehensive income (listed equity securities).\n- \u00bb Fair value through profit or loss (derivative financial instruments except those that are in a designated hedge relationship).",

Share-based payments\n\n## Incentive Plans\n\nThe Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIs) are designed to link reward with the key performance drivers that underpin sustainable growth in shareholder value. With regard to the 2018/21, 2019/22 and 2020/23 LTIs, the performance conditions comprise relative total shareholder return, the delivery of certain long term value metrics and growth in return on equity for the LTI 2018/21 plan and absolute return on invested capital for the LTI 2019/22 and LTI 2020/23 plans.\n\nCertain Executives have been awarded performance rights under Short Term Incentive Plans (STIs) based on financial, safety and strategic outcomes.\n\nThese arrangements support the Company's strategy for retention and motivation of its executives.\n\n## Expenses arising from share-based payment transactions\n\nTotal expenses arising from share-based payment transactions recognised during the period as part of employee benefit expense were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                        | 2021   $mill   | 2020   $mill   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Accounting value of performance rights issued  under the LTI and STI performance plans | 3.2            | 2.4            |\n|                                                                                        | 2021   Number  | 2020   Number  |\n| Number of performance rights outstanding  under the LTI and STI performance plans      | 6,285,054      | 5,082,644      |\n\nDetails of the movements in LTI and STI performance rights are disclosed in the Remuneration Report.\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\nThe rights to shares granted to employees under the terms of the plans are measured at fair value. The fair value is recognised as an employee expense over the period that employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights. There is a corresponding increase in equity, which is reflected in the share based payments reserve.\n\nThe amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of rights taken up, once related service and other non-market conditions are met.\n\n## 19.

The following table summarises how the defined benefit obligation as at 30 September 2021 would have increased/(decreased) as a result of a change in the respective assumption by 1 percentage point:\n\n|                         | 1 percent  increase   | 1 percent  decrease   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Discount rate           | (26.8)                | 32.2                  |\n| Rate of salary increase | 1.3                   | (1.2)                 |\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\nAll employees of the group are entitled to benefits from the Group's superannuation plan on retirement, disability or death or can direct the group to make contributions to a defined contribution plan of their choice. The Group's superannuation plan has a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section. The defined benefit section provides defined lump sum benefits based on years of service and final average salary. The defined contribution section receives fixed contributions from group companies and the Group's legal or constructive obligation is limited to these contributions.\n\nThe liability or asset recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\nChanges in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or loss as past service costs.\n\nContributions to the defined contribution section of the Group's superannuation fund and other independent defined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense as they become payable.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date is based on expected future payments arising from membership of the fund. This is calculated annually by independent actuaries considering the expected future wage and salary levels of employees, experience of employee departures and employee periods of service.\n\nExpected future payments are discounted using market yields on corporate bonds at the reporting date, which have terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.",

The Group has prepared  a  value-in-use  model  to determine the recoverable  amount of  each CGU.\n\nThe Group's Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific ('DNAP') model  is  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in terminal value assumptions, including natural gas prices, commodity prices, terminal value growth rate and discount rate.\n\nThe  Group  also  recorded  material  asset impairment  write-downs  relating  to  the Cheyenne  plant  during  the  current  period which was subject to management's estimates and assumptions in relation determining the impairment amount.\n\nOur procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Understanding  the  relevant  controls  and  process  that management  has  undertaken  to  assess  the  recoverable amount\n- \u00b7 In conjunction with our valuation specialists:\n- o Evaluating the appropriateness of the model used by management to calculate the value-in-use of the CGUs and Cheyenne manufacturing assets.\n- o Assessing and challenging the key inputs to the DNAP terminal value and Cheyenne impairment model by:\n- \u00a7 Corroborating the key independent market based assumptions  built  into  the  terminal  value  to external  analysts'  reports,  published  industry growth rates and industry reports;\n- \u00a7 Corroborating the key non-market based assumptions  by  comparing  Board  approved forecasts  to  historical  performance  to  test  the accuracy of management's projections;\n- \u00a7 Agreeing contracted volumes and pricing assumptions in the model to the Board approved forecasts;\n- \u00a7 Comparing  the  discount  rates  applied  to  the terminal value with an independently developed rate; and\n- \u00a7 Performing a range of sensitivity analysis on the terminal value with other assumptions including discount  rates,  natural  gas  prices,  commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures included in the Notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  auditor's  report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group's audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## R Reeppoorrtt  oonn  tthhee  RReemmuunneerraattiioonn  RReeppoorrtt\n\nOpinion on the Remuneration Report\n\nWe have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 64 to 84 of the Director's Report for the year ended 30 September 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the Remuneration Report of the Incitec Pivot Limited, for the year ended 30 September 2021, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .
