Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company operates in eight states and provides a comprehensive portfolio of energyrelated products and services to 3.7 million electricity customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers.\n\n## FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\n|                               | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total GAAP earnings per share | 2.79   | 2.96   |\n| Ongoing earnings per share    | 2.79   | 2.96   |\n| Dividends annualized          | 1.72   | 1.83   |\n| Stock price (close)           | 66.67  | 67.70  |\n| Assets (millions)             | 53,957 | 57,851 |\n\n## EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n## Dollars per share (diluted)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share\n\n- Ongoing earnings per share\n\n## INCREASED FOCUS ON DEI DRIVES POSITIVE RESULTS\n\nXcel Energy is committed to cultivating an equitable and inclusive work environment, with a skilled, engaged and diverse workforce that re/flects the communities we serve. We continue to weave the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) into the fabric of our company and to provide an environment where all employees feel they can be themselves and genuinely are included and empowered to do their best work.\n\nTo ensure this crucial topic receives appropriate attention and visibility, the company adopted a new index to measure progress on speci/fic aspects of DEI for the corporate scorecard in 2021. The index measures three key elements of the company's DEI strategy: the use of diverse interview panels in the hiring process, performance of our overall inclusion index and active participation in the executive sponsorship program that supports career growth by pairing executives with employees who are diverse from themselves.\n\nXcel Energy exceeded its targets for each of the three factors in 2021 and will retain the DEI metric on its corporate scorecard in 2022.\n\nAs a result of our commitment to diversity, we have seen a 6% increase in women and a 5% increase in diverse representation within our senior leadership at the vice-presidential level and above.\n\n'As a purpose-driven and values-led organization, we continue to build a culture of belonging where diverse viewpoints are appreciated,' said Baird McKevitt, Director, Inclusion and Diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nON THE COVER: Pictured is a solar facility in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, adjacent to our state headquarters.

        "page_content": "## Solid /financial performance\n\nFor the 17th consecutive year, we met or exceeded our earnings guidance, and we increased our dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We delivered earnings of $2.96 per share, within the upper half of our initial guidance range. We increased our dividend 6.4%, or 11 cents per share in 2021, which is in line with our 5% to 7% goal. Our stock continues to trade at a premium and has outperformed our peer group for the three-, /five- and ten-year periods.\n\nOur robust /five-year, $26 billion capital investment plan will provide signi/ficant customer value and drive regulated rate base growth of 6.5%. And, we've identi/fied additional investment opportunities in that timeframe for an incremental capital investment of $1.5 to $2.5 billion, which would increase our growth rate to 7.4%.\n\n## Clean energy leadership\n\nIn November, we announced a clean energy vision for our natural gas distribution business. Our vision reduces greenhouse gas emissions 25% from 2020 levels by 2030, including netzero methane emissions from our distribution system, and delivers net-zero natural gas service to customers by 2050. (See story on page 14).\n\nOur natural gas vision builds on our previously announced electric goals for reducing carbon emissions 80% by 2030 and producing 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. We also plan to use our increasingly clean product to power 1.5 million electric vehicles in our states by the end of the decade, resulting in additional carbon reduction, future sales growth, and customer fuel savings. Together, these commitments represent a comprehensive clean energy vision, making Xcel Energy the /first U.S. energy provider to set aggressive clean energy goals across all the ways our customers use energy: electricity, transportation, and heating. And we are well on our way to achieving that vision.\n\n## Delivering at critical times\n\nWe never take for granted the trust we have earned to power millions of homes and businesses all day, every day, particularly during extreme weather. In 2021, there were two signi/ficant events that impacted our service territory - Winter Storm Uri in Texas and the Marshall Wild/fire in Colorado. These two natural disasters challenged our teams to deliver in the most arduous conditions. And as always, we rose to the challenge.\n\nHistoric cold temperatures during Winter Storm Uri froze natural gas wells throughout Texas and Oklahoma, creating natural gas supply constraints and price spikes across the country. At the same time, the Texas electric system saw generation equipment failures caused by the cold, which left millions without power or heat. Our plants and equipment in the Southwest are winterized for extreme temperatures and performed very well during the event, despite widespread failures of other generating assets.\n\nDespite our employees operating our gas distribution system extremely capably during the 10-day record-setting cold period, we were not immune from the sudden, extraordinary increase in natural gas prices that went along with Winter Storm Uri. We incurred $925 million of additional fuel costs that we are working with regulators to recover while helping customers manage costs.\n\nFollowing a particularly dry fourth quarter, on Dec. 30, Colorado faced an intense windstorm that packed 110 mph winds and fueled the devastating Marshall Wild/fire. The Boulder County /fires destroyed more than 1,200 homes and businesses in the area, and partially or totally destroyed the homes of 17 of our own employees.\n\nHundreds of employees, contractors and mutual aid crews were on the scene as soon as it was safe and worked around the clock to get service restored to the impacted communities.\n\nThese extreme weather events reinforce the need for continued investment in system resiliency, such as our approved wild/fire mitigation program, to protect communities from the growing impacts of climate change.\n\n## Constructive regulatory outcomes\n\nWe reached constructive rate case settlements in six states last year. In Colorado, we also reached constructive settlements for Winter Storm Uri cost recovery, our electric resource plan and our Power Pathway transmission project, a nearly $2 billion investment necessary to enable future renewable generation assets.\n\nThe New Mexico commission approved our Transportation Electri/fication Plan, and we launched several commercial and residential programs to support electric vehicle adoption in Colorado as part of our approved, industryleading Transportation Electri/fication Plan. (See story on pages 10-11). In February 2022, the New Mexico commission also approved our electric rate case settlement.",

        "page_content": "Also in February 2022, the company received approval for its Upper Midwest Generation Resource Plan, including a full closure of all coal plants in the region by 2030, over 85% carbon reduction, 5,750 megawatts of new wind and solar assets, and transmission infrastructure to enable those resources. The plan also includes a license extension of our Monticello nuclear plant through 2040. Our proposed resource plan in Colorado would add 5,100 megawatts of new renewable generation assets and is expected to reduce carbon emissions 87% by 2030. (See story on pages 8-9).\n\n## Renewable energy expansion\n\nOur Steel for Fuel strategy - building and owning wind farms that deliver economic and environmental beneGLYPH<31>ts for our customers continues to drive organic growth, provide an attractive shareholder return, and save customers money. Since 2017, wind energy - through a combination of fuel savings and tax credits saved customers an estimated $1.8 billion.\n\nWe now have over 11,000 megawatts of total wind capacity, including nearly 4,500 megawatts of owned wind. We also advanced plans for owning our GLYPH<31>rst large-scale solar projects. We received approval for a 74-megawatt solar project in Wisconsin and proposed a 460-megawatt project near our Sherco coal plant in Minnesota.\n\n## Advanced Grid Initiative\n\nOur $1.7 billion, multi-year Advanced Grid Initiative, to use advanced technology to bring customers cleaner, safer, more reliable energy, achieved a signiGLYPH<31>cant milestone in 2021 as the GLYPH<31>rst batch of 310,000 smart meters were installed in Colorado. The two-way communication capabilities will help improve reliability, reduce the time it takes to restore power during an outage, and provide customers more options to manage their energy use and save money. (See story on pages 6-7).\n\n## Operational excellence\n\nOperational excellence is at the core of our commitment and approach to operating our plants and facilities and our preparedness to respond to extreme weather and other events. We remain the top-performing nuclear GLYPH<30>eet in the country. One of our units at Prairie Island operated for a record 703 consecutive days before its scheduled refueling in October. Additionally, we have held our operating and maintenance costs GLYPH<30>at since 2013, helping to\n\nkeep customer bills low without compromising safety or reliability. We remain committed to our industry-leading 'Safety Always' program. (See story on pages 12-13).\n\n## Employee focus\n\nAs we have done since the start of the pandemic, our employees continue to follow extra safety protocols to protect themselves, their coworkers, and their loved ones from COVID-19. Approximately half of our employees worked remotely in 2021 but are returning to the ofGLYPH<31>ce this spring with a hybrid work schedule as the pandemic continues to recede.\n\nThe company added diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) metrics to its corporate scorecard for the GLYPH<31>rst time in 2021, and I am pleased to report that we exceeded our goals. Diversity and inclusion make us a stronger company and a more welcoming workplace, where we can attract and retain top talent. (See story on page 2).\n\nIt's an honor to lead this team - more than 11,000 employees strong - that is consistently recognized with its outstanding business practices and ethics, operational performance, veteran hiring, and workplace culture. We were honored to be named among the World's Most Ethical Companies \u00ae by Ethisphere for the third consecutive year, reGLYPH<30>ecting the company's commitment to sustainability and ethical business practices. We also were among the Human Rights Campaign's Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality, earning a perfect score on its Corporate Equality Index for the sixth consecutive year. We were named one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the ninth consecutive year and ranked second among energy providers.\n\nWith the best employees in the industry serving you, I'm excited about the future not just what's in store for 2022, but for the transformative progress on the horizon. You can count on the Xcel Energy team to deliver for you. Thanks for the continued trust you place in us.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBob Frenzel Chairman, President and Chief Executive Of/ficer",

Small changes like running the dishwasher or operating laundry machines later at night or in the morning will generate savings on energy bills. Previously, energy rates in the state remained constant at all hours because older meter technology could not differentiate usage by time of day.\n\nCustomers will have new digital tools to make it easy to access their energy information and gain useful insights to better understand and manage their energy use and make smarter energy choices that lower their bills and save money.\n\nTo prepare for the smart meter rollout, a secure /field network communications system was built and expanded, allowing the smart meters to send encrypted information to Xcel Energy through\n\na series of secure communication devices. Simultaneously, new software tools and controls were deployed for the company's distribution control centers to increase reliability and resiliency, optimize voltage levels throughout the system and help the company better manage the energy grid throughout our eight-state footprint. An advanced application in the new system software for voltage management, along with the addition of 430 /field devices, generated 127.5 gigawatt hours of energy savings for customers in Colorado last year.\n\nWhile the rollout will continue in Colorado over the next three years, the /first smart meters are expected to begin deployment in Minnesota in 2022 and the Dakotas in 2023, with Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin and Michigan starting later. By the end of 2024, nearly 3.9 million smart meters will be installed across our eight states.\n\nOperations Manager Jamin Argon from the Advanced Grid Initiative team explains the bene/fits of a smart meter to Xcel Energy customer Kelly Almer of Littleton, Colorado.

IT TAKES A TRACK RECORD OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, STRONG STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND A BALANCED, THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO DRIVE SIGNIFICANT CARBON REDUCTIONS WHILE ENSURING RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS.\n\nBy completing the Dakota Range Wind Farm near Watertown, S.D., in early 2022, Xcel Energy successfully completed the largest multi-state wind investment in the nation, adding 3,600 megawatts of new company-owned wind projects since 2017. Xcel Energy now has more than 11,000 megawatts of wind capacity on its system and is among a handful of companies to exceed the 10,000-megawatt threshold.\n\n'Wind energy drives both economic and environmental bene/fits for our customers, while\n\nwind ownership provides an attractive investment return for our shareholders. We've proven that we can effectively build and operate wind farms as part of our Steel for Fuel growth strategy,' said Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations.\n\n'We estimate our wind farms generated approximately $1.8 billion in savings for customers over the past /five years. In addition, wind farms provide a strong tax base, along with both construction and permanent jobs, and landowner\n\nlease payments help drive the economy in rural communities.'\n\nTransitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like wind and solar has helped the company reduce carbon emissions 50% since 2005 and remain on pace for an 80% reduction by the end of the decade.\n\nSpeci/fic plans to achieve that goal are now being /finalized after the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved our clean energy proposal for the Upper Midwest system. They include retiring all coal plants in the region by 2030, extending the use of our carbon-free Monticello Nuclear Generating Station to 2040 and adding approximately 5,800 megawatts of wind and solar power. Natural gas would continue to be used as a bridge fuel to ensure reliability until new technologies are developed.",

In addition, the company has received verbal approval for\n\nColorado's Power Pathway, a nearly $2 billion transmission investment to improve the state's electric grid and deliver various proposed renewable energy projects to our customers. Once the written order is issued and work can begin, the transmission projects and new substations are expected to be completed starting in 2025 and continuing through 2027.\n\nAchieving the company's industryleading vision to produce carbonfree electricity for our customers by 2050 will require new clean energy technologies. One of the most promising emerging technologies is using carbon-free energy to produce hydrogen. Xcel Energy is partnering with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory on a pilot project that is scheduled to begin producing carbon-free hydrogen at our Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Station next year that can be used in other applications.\n\nIn early 2022, Xcel Energy completed the largest multi-state wind investment in the country at the time - 14 wind farms in seven states. More wind projects are on the horizon in the recently approved Upper Midwest Resource Plan and proposed Colorado Energy Plan.\n\nIn 2020, the company created the Carbon-Free Technology Initiative, a cross-functional group set up to identify and support the future technologies critical to achieving our carbon-free goals.

In doing so, the company became the /first U.S. energy provider to announce a comprehensive vision with aggressive goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions across three large sectors of the economy: electricity, natural gas use in buildings and transportation.\n\n'Our vision for delivering net-zero energy by 2050 is an important evolution in our clean energy strategy,' said Frank Prager, Xcel Energy's Chief Sustainability Of/ficer. 'As a clean energy leader, it's important that we have a plan for reducing our footprint across all areas of our business and provide customers a path to continue using reliable, affordable energy while reducing their emissions as well.'\n\nThe new clean natural gas commitment builds on Xcel Energy's vision to deliver 100% carbon-free electricity to customers by 2050, with an aggressive interim goal of\n\nreducing emissions 80% by 2030. That vision, announced in 2018, led to dozens of U.S. power providers announcing similar goals to eliminate carbon from their electric systems. In 2020, we announced a goal to use our increasingly green product for powering 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service areas by the end of the decade.\n\nAlong with a net-zero natural gas commitment, we set an important interim goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas service 25% from 2020 levels, including net-zero methane emissions on our own infrastructure by 2030. We will target three discrete segments of the natural gas value chain: our own natural gas infrastructure, our suppliers and their upstream infrastructure, and customer usage and emissions.\n\nThis clean energy transformation starts with our own system where signi/ficant progress has already been made to reduce methane emissions. We will increase our emissions detection\n\nGas /fitter Debbra Trevino checks the pressure at a natural gas meter in Denver, Colorado.\n\nand repair work and continue to make operational and system improvements. As we move up the supply chain, we will, over time, purchase only certi/fied lowemissions gas from our suppliers.\n\nAnd for our customers, we will offer new voluntary programs to reduce carbon emissions from their own natural gas use, through expanded conservation efforts and the use of electric appliances and low-carbon gas alternatives, including hydrogen and renewable natural gas. Xcel Energy is set to launch a heaters and air source heat pumps\n\nseries of pilots to test renewable natural gas, smart electric water with customers, as well as test both hydrogen production and the blending of hydrogen in its natural gas delivery system.",

A lead author for the IPCC confirmed that our vision aligns  with  science-based  scenarios  likely  to  limit  global  warming  to  1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGoal includes owned and purchased power.\n\nThe pace of achieving  a  carbon-free  vision  is  governed  by  reliability  and customer affordability. Our filed resource plans outline a clear, transparent path to achieve an 80% carbon reduction using current technologies, while maintaining customer bill increases at or below the rate of inflation. Moving from 80% carbon reduction to 100% carbon-free electricity will require new dispatchable  and  scalable  technologies  that  are  economically  viable,  as well  as  supportive  public  policy.  Resiliency  and  innovation  also  remain paramount to a successful transition, as does the economic vitality of our communities.\n\nAs  we  prepare  for  early  coal  plant  retirements,  we  provide  employees advanced notice and offer retraining and relocation opportunities, with no layoffs  to  date.  We  also  help  attract  and  make  investments  to  offset community  economic  impacts.  Xcel  Energy  has  a  long  track  record  of working  with  our  communities  on  energy,  climate  and  environmental initiatives  that  impact  them  and  has  publicly  committed  to  furthering environmental justice.\n\nWe consistently  set  aggressive  goals  and  hold  ourselves  accountable  to our customers, communities and investors, as well as, to our own values. Xcel  Energy  instituted  oversight  of  environmental  performance  by  the Board of Directors beginning in 2000 and was among the first U.S. utilities to tie carbon reduction to executive compensation over fifteen years ago.\n\nThrough  2021,  we  reduced  carbon  emissions  from  generation  serving customers by an estimated 50% (from 2005 levels) and remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030.\n\n## Other notable environmental improvements include:\n\nResults from owned generation except for water, which includes owned and purchased power. * Coal ash reduction is as of 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nXcel  Energy  has  provided  a  voluntary,  third-party  verified  annual  GHG disclosure since 2005, longer than any other U.S. utility. We are a founding member  of  The  Climate  Registry  and  a  supporter  of  the  Task  Force  on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Our disclosures also align with the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals frameworks.\n\nSince  year-end  2020,  we  have  completed  four  wind  farms,  adding  ~800 MW (includes the Dakota Range project which went in service in January 2022) of owned wind to our system that provides significant environmental benefits and cost savings for our customers. Xcel Energy's wind capacity is now over 11,000 MW, including nearly 4,500 MW of owned wind.\n\nBy 2030, we project that approximately 80% of our energy will come from carbon-free resources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased  on  resource  plans  filed  in  Minnesota  and  Colorado,  Xcel  Energy anticipates  nearly  10,000  MW  of  additional  renewables  over  the  next decade, and expects to be coal-free by 2034.\n\nColorado resource plan - settlement pending CPUC approval\n\n- \u00b7 87% carbon reduction by 2030 and full coal exit by 2034.\n- \u00b7 ~3,900 MW of wind and solar additions.\n- \u00b7 ~1,700 MW of flexible resources and storage.\n- \u00b7 ~1,200 MW of distributed solar generation.\n\n## Minnesota resource plan - approved by MPUC\n\n- \u00b7 85% carbon reduction and full coal exit by 2030.\n- \u00b7 4,650 MW of wind and solar additions by 2032; the plan includes an additional 1,100 MW of renewables beyond 2032.\n- \u00b7 Transmission infrastructure to connect new renewables to the grid.\n- \u00b7 Extension of the Monticello nuclear plant through 2040.\n- \u00b7 ~3,800  MW  of  firm  peaking  capacity  for  reliability  before  2030, including hydrogen-ready  combustion  turbines,  the  combustion turbines will need to go through a CON process.\n- \u00b7 Additional ~2,100 MW of firm capacity and storage post 2030, to be addressed in future proceedings.\n\n## Texas and New Mexico\n\n- \u00b7 Proposed full coal exit by 2034 upon early retirement of our Tolk plant.\n- \u00b7 Conversion of our Harrington coal plant to natural gas.",

        "page_content": "We  plan  to  limit  coal  usage  through  dispatching  units  seasonally  where possible.  Natural  gas  and  other  dispatchable  resources  will  be  used  as needed  for  reliability  and  resiliency  as  more  renewables  come  on  the system.\n\nSignificant  transmission  expansion  will  be  required  to  enable  future renewables. Our Pathway project (if approved) in Colorado will provide over 560  miles  of  transmission  lines  and  enable  nearly  5,500  MW  of  new renewables,  including  access  to  some  of  the  region's  richest  wind resources.  We  also  anticipate  expansion  in  the  Upper  Midwest  over  the next  decade  as  part  of  MISO's  transmission  expansion  planning  effort, creating investment opportunity.\n\nOur  clean  energy  leadership  encompasses  our  natural  gas  business  as well.  In  2021,  we  committed  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  by  25%  by  2030 from 2020 levels and deliver net-zero natural gas service by 2050, including customer use.\n\n## Plans include:\n\n- \u00b7 Influencing suppliers - pursue certified low/no net emissions supply.\n- \u00b7 Operating the cleanest possible system - incorporate clean fuels.\n- \u00b7 Offering customer options -encourage electrification, where beneficial.\n\nXcel  Energy's  leadership  also  extends  beyond  our  electric  and  gas businesses to other parts of the economy. In addition to transitioning our own generation fleet, we are helping to decarbonize other sectors, starting with transportation. We aim to enable 1.5 million EVs across our states by 2030, representing a nearly $2 billion investment, 0.6% to 0.7% incremental annual retail sales growth and avoidance of roughly 5 million tons of CO2 emissions annually.\n\n## Enhance the Customer Experience\n\nXcel  Energy  has  a  comprehensive  suite  of  renewable  and  conservation programs that provide customers with clean energy options and help keep their bills low. We are also transforming and expanding our electric grid to accommodate  increased  load  growth,  renewable  energy  and  distributed energy resources.\n\nIn  2021,  Xcel  Energy  installed  over  300,000  smart  meters  and  plans  to install  more  than  one  million  in  2022.  Xcel  Energy  also  launched  12  EV programs for residential  and  commercial  customers,  received  approval  of our New Mexico plan, and continued to prepare for increased levels of EV adoption across our states.\n\nFor our local communities, we initiated 20 economic development projects in 2021, which are projected to lead to over $1 billion in capital investments and 5,000 jobs. Additionally, over 60% of our supply chain spend was local.\n\n## Keep Bills Low\n\nCustomer  affordability  is  critical  to  successful  strategy  execution  and  we are  working  to  keep  bill  increases  at  or  below  the  rate  of  inflation.  Since 2013,  we  have  managed  average  residential  bill  growth  to  below  1% annually,  with  electric  and  natural  gas  bill  increases  of  0.8%  and  0.3%, respectively.\n\nXcel Energy has invested more than $2 billion over the past decade in a comprehensive  suite  of  conservation  programs.  We  have  kept  O&M expenses flat since 2014, while adding significant renewables and without compromising safety or reliability.\n\nXcel Energy continues to prudently invest in appropriate areas consistent with its continuing commitment to minimize costs through ongoing process and technology improvements.\n\nOur  geographic  advantages  in  wind  and  solar  also  enable  customer savings, which we call our 'Steel for Fuel' strategy. High capacity factors, coupled  with  renewable  tax  credits  and  avoided  fuel  costs,  enable  Xcel Energy  to  add  renewables  while  saving  customers  money.  To  date,  we have  delivered  more  than  $1.8  billion  in  customer  savings  by  adding owned wind to our system.\n\nIn  addition  to  continued  savings  from  economic  renewables,  disciplined cost  control  and  future  coal  plant  retirements,  we  anticipate  sales  growth from electric vehicles will help keep bills low for all customers in the long term,  as  well  as  provide  customers  with  annual  fuel  savings  (equivalent cost per gallon for fueling with electricity vs. gasoline) of approximately $1 billion by 2030.\n\n## Deliver a Competitive Total Return to Investors\n\nSuccessful  strategy  execution,  along  with  our  disciplined  approach  to growth,  operations  and  management  of  environmental,  social  and governance issues, positions us to continue delivering a competitive TSR.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  have  consistently  achieved  our  financial  objectives,  meeting  or exceeding our initial earnings guidance range for 17 consecutive years and delivering dividend growth for 18 consecutive years.\n\nOver the past five years, GAAP earnings have grown by 6% annually and our  annual  dividend  growth  was  6.1%.  Xcel  Energy  works  to  maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range and senior unsecured debt credit  ratings  in  the  BBB+  to  A  range.  Current  ratings  are  consistent  with this goal.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nXcel  Energy  employees  are  the  driving  force  behind  our  Company's success. Our strategic, data-driven approach to workforce planning helps ensure we will continue to have the skills and capabilities required to meet the evolving needs of our business, customers and communities. We are also deeply committed to diversity, equity, human rights and safety.\n\n## Safety\n\nContinuously  elevating  the  quality  and  safety  of  the  workplace  is  a  top priority.  We  are  considered  a  benchmark  company for our Safety Always approach,  focused  on  eliminating  life-altering  injuries  through  a  trusted, transparent  culture  and  the  use  of  critical  controls.  All  employees  have 'stop work authority' and are expected to keep each other, our customers and  the  public  safe.  Employees  are  encouraged  to  speak  up,  share experiences  and  learn  from  events  to  help  protect  themselves,  their coworkers and the public.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  oversight  for  employee  and  public  safety through  the  Operations,  Nuclear,  Environmental  and  Safety  committee, both of which are also tied to annual incentive compensation.",

Management  cannot  predict  the  impact  of  fluctuating energy  prices,  pandemics,  terrorist  activity,  war  or  the  threat  of  war.  We could  experience  a  material  impact  to  our  results  of  operations,  future growth  or  ability  to  raise  capital  resulting  from  a  sustained  general slowdown in economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates or inflation.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nDemand  for  electric  power  and  natural  gas  is  affected  by  seasonal differences in the weather. In general, peak sales of electricity occur in the summer months and peak sales of natural gas occur in the winter months. As a result,  the  overall  operating  results  may  fluctuate  substantially  on  a seasonal  basis.  Additionally,  Xcel  Energy's  operations  have  historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer.\n\n## Competition\n\nXcel  Energy  is  subject  to  public  policies  that  promote  competition  and development  of  energy  markets.  Xcel  Energy's  industrial  and  large commercial customers have the ability to generate their own electricity. In addition,  customers  may  have  the  option  of  substituting  other  fuels  or relocating their facilities to a lower cost region.\n\nCustomers have the opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation including solar generation and in most jurisdictions can currently avoid paying for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them.",

        "page_content": "Several  states  have  incentives  for  the  development  of  rooftop  solar, community  solar  gardens  and  other  distributed  energy  resources. Distributed generating resources are potential competitors to Xcel Energy's electric service business with these incentives and federal tax subsidies.\n\nThe  FERC  has  continued  to  promote  competitive  wholesale  markets through  open  access  transmission  and  other  means.  Xcel  Energy's wholesale customers can purchase their output from generation resources of competing  suppliers  or  non-contracted  quantities  and  use  the transmission  systems  of  the  utility  subsidiaries  on  a  comparable  basis  to serve their native load.\n\nFERC Order No. 1000 established competition for ownership of certain new electric transmission facilities under Federal regulations. Some states have state laws that allow the incumbent a Right of First Refusal to own these transmission facilities.\n\nFERC Order 2222 requires that RTO and ISO markets allow participation of aggregations  of  distributed  energy  resources.  This  order  is  expected  to incentivize  distributed  energy  resource  adoption,  however  implementation is  expected  to  vary  by  RTO/ISO  and  the  near,  medium,  and  long-term impacts of Order 2222 remain unclear.\n\nXcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries have franchise agreements with cities subject to periodic renewal; however, a city could seek alternative means to access electric power or gas, such as municipalization.\n\nWhile each utility subsidiary faces these challenges, Xcel Energy believes their rates and services are competitive with alternatives currently available.\n\n## Governmental Regulations\n\n## Public Utility Regulation\n\nSee Item 7 for discussion of public utility regulation.\n\n## Environmental Regulation\n\nOur  facilities  are  regulated  by  federal  and  state  agencies  that  have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous wastes or substances. Certain Xcel Energy activities require registrations,  permits,  licenses,  inspections  and  approvals  from  these agencies.\n\nXcel Energy has received necessary authorizations for the construction and continued  operation  of  its  generation,  transmission  and  distribution systems.  Our  facilities  strive  to  operate  in  compliance  with  applicable environmental standards and related monitoring and reporting requirements.\n\nHowever,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  what  additional  facilities  or modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes  to  regulations,  interpretations  or  enforcement  policies  or  what effect  future  laws  or  regulations  may  have.  We  may  be  required  to  incur expenditures in the future for remediation of MGP and other sites.\n\nXcel  Energy  must  comply  with  emission  levels  in  Minnesota,  Texas  and Wisconsin  that  may  require  the  purchase  of  emission  allowances.  The Denver North Front Range Non-attainment Area does not meet the ozone NAAQS. Colorado will continue to consider further reductions available in the  non-attainment  area  as  it  develops  plans  to  meet  ozone  standards. Natural  gas  plants  which  operate  in  PSCo's  non-attainment  area  may  be required to improve or add controls, implement further work practices and/ or enhanced emissions monitoring as part of future Colorado state plans.\n\nThere are significant environmental regulations to encourage use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. We have undertaken numerous initiatives to meet current requirements and prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. Future environmental regulations may result in substantial costs.\n\nIn  July  2019,  the  EPA  adopted  the  Affordable  Clean  Energy  rule,  which requires  states  to  develop  plans  by  2022  for  GHG  reductions  from  coalfired power plants. In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit  issued  a  decision  vacating  and  remanding  the  Affordable  Clean Energy rule. That decision would allow the EPA to proceed with alternate regulation  of  coal-fired  power  plants.  However,  the  Court  of  Appeals decision  is  now  before  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court,  where  the  Court  is expected  to  rule  on  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  EPA's  GHG  regulatory authority.  If  any  new  rules  require  additional  investment,  Xcel  Energy believes that the cost of these initiatives or replacement generation would be recoverable through rates based on prior state commission practices.\n\nIn October 2020, the TCEQ approved an agreement that SPS will convert the  Harrington  plant  from  coal  to  natural  gas  by  Jan.  1,  2025.  This conversion  is  necessary  to  attain  Federal  Clean  Air  Act  standards  for emissions of SO2.\n\nXcel Energy seeks to address climate change and potential climate change regulation through efforts to reduce its GHG emissions in a balanced, costeffective manner.\n\n## Emerging Environmental Regulation\n\nNew regulations and legislation are being considered to regulate PFAS in drinking water, water discharges, commercial products, wastes, and other areas. PFAS are man-made chemicals found in many consumer products that can persist and accumulate in the environment. These chemicals have received  heightened  attention  from  environmental  regulators.  Increased regulation of PFAS and other emerging contaminants at the federal, state, and local level could have a potential adverse effect on our operations but at  this  time,  it  is  uncertain  what  impact,  if  any,  there  will  be  on  our operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows.  Xcel  Energy  will  continue  to monitor  these  regulatory  developments  and  their  potential  impact  on  its operations.\n\n## Environmental Costs\n\nEnvironmental  costs  include  amounts  for  nuclear  plant  decommissioning and  payments  for  storage  of  spent  nuclear  fuel,  disposal  of  hazardous materials  and  waste,  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  monitoring  of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to emissions.\n\nCosts charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning, spent nuclear  fuel  disposal,  environmental  monitoring  and  remediation  and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately:\n\n- \u00b7 $365 million in 2021.\n- \u00b7 $400 million in 2020.\n- \u00b7 $345 million in 2019.\n\nAverage annual expense of approximately $425 million from 2022 - 2026 is estimated for similar costs. The  precise timing and  amount  of environmental  costs,  including  those  for  site  remediation  and  disposal  of hazardous  materials,  are  unknown.  Additionally,  the  extent  to  which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate.",

        "page_content": "Xcel Energy is subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control.  Risks  that  may  adversely  affect  the  business,  financial  condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the  risks  are  interrelated.  These  risks  should  be  carefully  considered together with the other information set forth in this report and future reports that we file with the SEC. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.\n\nWhile  we  believe  we  have  identified  and  discussed  below  the  key  risk factors  affecting  our  business,  there  may  be  additional  risks  and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.\n\n## Oversight of Risk and Related Processes\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of material risk and maintaining  an  effective  risk  monitoring  process.  Management  and  the Board  of  Directors'  committees  have  responsibility  for  overseeing  the identification and mitigation of key risks and reporting its assessments and activities to the full Board of Directors.\n\nXcel  Energy  maintains  a  robust  compliance  program  and  promotes  a culture of compliance beginning with the tone at the top. The risk mitigation process  includes  adherence  to  our  code  of  conduct  and  compliance policies,  operation  of  formal  risk  management  structures  and  overall business management. Xcel Energy further mitigates inherent risks through formal risk committees and corporate functions such as internal audit, and internal controls over financial reporting and legal.\n\nManagement  identifies  and  analyzes  risks  to  determine  materiality  and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. Identification and  risk  analysis  occurs  formally  through  risk  assessment  conducted  by senior management,  the  financial  disclosure  process,  hazard  risk procedures,  internal  audit  and  compliance  with  financial  and  operational controls.\n\nManagement  also  identifies  and  analyzes  risk  through  the  business planning  process,  development  of  goals  and  establishment  of  key performance indicators, including identification of barriers to implementing Xcel  Energy's  strategy.  The  business  planning  process  also  identifies likelihood and mitigating factors to prevent the assumption of inappropriate risk to meet goals.\n\nManagement communicates regularly with the Board of Directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. Senior management presents and communicates  a  periodic  risk  assessment  to  the  Board  of  Directors, providing information on the risks that management believes are material, including  financial  impact,  timing,  likelihood  and  mitigating  factors.  The Board of Directors regularly reviews management's key risk assessments, which  includes  areas  of  existing  and  future  macroeconomic,  financial, operational, policy, environmental and security risks.\n\nThe  oversight,  management  and  mitigation  of  risk  is  an  integral  and continuous part of the Board of Directors' governance of Xcel Energy. The Board  of  Directors  assigns  oversight  of  critical  risks  to  each  of  its  four committees  to  ensure  these  risks  are  well  understood  and  given appropriate focus.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  reviewing  the  adequacy  of  the committee's  risk  oversight  and  affirming  appropriate  aggregate  oversight occurs. Committees regularly report on their oversight activities and certain risk issues may be brought to the full Board of Directors for consideration when deemed appropriate.\n\nNew risks are considered and assigned as appropriate during the annual Board of Directors and committee evaluation process, resulting in updates to the committee charters and annual work plans.  Additionally, the Board of  Directors  conducts  an  annual  strategy  session  where  Xcel  Energy's future plans and initiatives are reviewed.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nOur natural gas and electric generation/transmission and distribution operations involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nOur  natural  gas  transmission  and  distribution  activities  include  inherent hazards  and  operating  risks,  such  as  leaks,  explosions,  outages  and mechanical problems. Our electric generation, transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and outages.\n\nThese  risks  could  result  in  loss  of  life,  significant  property  damage, environmental  pollution,  impairment  of  our  operations  and  substantial financial  losses  to  employees,  third-party  contractors,  customers  or  the public. We maintain insurance against most, but not all, of these risks and losses.\n\nThe  occurrence  of  these  events,  if  not  fully  covered  by  insurance,  could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as potential loss of reputation.\n\nOther  uncertainties  and  risks  inherent  in  operating  and  maintaining  Xcel Energy's facilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned.\n- \u00b7 Failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supplies.\n- \u00b7 The  impact  of  unusual  or  adverse  weather  conditions  and  natural disasters, including, but not limited to, tornadoes, icing events, floods and droughts.\n- \u00b7 Performance  below  expected  or  contracted  levels  of  output  or efficiency (e.g., performance guarantees).\n- \u00b7 Availability of replacement equipment.\n- \u00b7 Availability  of  adequate  water  resources  and  ability  to  satisfy  water intake and discharge requirements.\n- \u00b7 Inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects.\n- \u00b7 Use of new or unproven technology.\n- \u00b7 Risks  associated  with  dependence  on  a  specific  type  of  fuel  or  fuel source,  such  as  commodity  price  risk,  availability  of  adequate  fuel supply  and  transportation  and  lack  of  available  alternative  fuel sources.\n- \u00b7 Increased  competition  due  to,  among  other  factors,  new  facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes.",

        "page_content": "Additionally, compliance with existing and potential new regulations related to  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  our  natural  gas  infrastructure  could result in significant costs. The PHMSA is responsible for administering the DOT's  national  regulatory  program  to  assure  the  safe  transportation  of natural  gas,  petroleum  and  other  hazardous  materials  by  pipelines.  The PHMSA  continues  to  develop  regulations  and  other  approaches  to  risk management  to  assure  safety  in  design,  construction,  testing,  operation, maintenance and emergency response of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. We have programs in place to comply with these regulations and systematically monitor and renew infrastructure over time, however, a significant  incident  or  material  finding  of  non-compliance  could  result  in penalties and higher costs of operations.\n\nOur  natural  gas  and  electric  transmission  and  distribution  operations  are dependent  upon  complex  information  technology  systems  and  network infrastructure,  the  failure  of  which  could  disrupt  our  normal  business operations,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  ability  to process transactions and provide services.\n\n## Our  utility  operations  are  subject  to  long-term  planning  and  project risks.\n\nMost  electric  utility  investments  are  planned  to  be  used  for  decades. Transmission  and  generation  investments  typically  have  long  lead  times and are planned well in advance of in-service dates and typically subject to long-term resource plans. These  plans  are  based  on  numerous assumptions  such  as:  sales  growth,  customer  usage,  commodity  prices, economic  activity,  costs,  regulatory  mechanisms,  customer  behavior, available  technology  and  public  policy.  Xcel  Energy's  long-term  resource plan  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  obtain  required  approvals,  develop necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources and adhere to budgets and timelines.\n\nIn  addition,  the  long-term  nature  of  both  our  planning  and  our  asset  lives are  subject  to  risk.  The  electric  utility  sector  is  undergoing  significant change (e.g., increases in energy efficiency, wider adoption of distributed generation  and  shifts  away  from  fossil  fuel  generation  to  renewable generation).  Customer  adoption  of  these  technologies  and  increased energy  efficiency  could  result  in  excess  transmission  and  generation resources,  downward  pressure  on  sales  growth,  and  potentially  stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments.\n\nThe magnitude and timing of resource additions and changes in customer demand may not coincide with evolving customer preference for generation resources and end-uses, which introduces further uncertainty into long-term planning.  Efforts  to  electrify  the  transportation  and  building  sectors  to reduce  GHG  emissions  may  result  in  higher  electric  demand  and  lower natural gas demand over time. Higher electric demand may require us to adopt new technologies and make significant transmission and distribution investments  including  advanced  grid  infrastructure,  which  increases exposure to overall grid instability and technology obsolescence. Evolving stakeholder  preference  for  lower  emissions  from  generation  sources  and end-uses, like heating, may impact our resource mix and put pressure on our  ability  to  recover  capital  investments  in  natural  gas  generation  and delivery. Multiple states may not agree as to the appropriate resource mix, which  may  lead  to  costs  to  comply  with  one  jurisdiction  that  are  not recoverable across all jurisdictions served by the same assets.\n\nWe are  subject  to  longer-term  availability  of  inputs  such  as  coal,  natural gas,  uranium and water to cool our facilities.  Lack  of  availability  of  these resources  could  jeopardize  long-term  operations  of  our  facilities  or  make them uneconomic to operate.\n\n## Our utilities are highly dependent on suppliers to deliver components in accordance with short and long-term project schedules.\n\nOur products contain components that are globally sourced from suppliers who,  in  turn,  source  components  from  their  suppliers.  A  shortage  of  key components  in  which  an  alternative  supplier  is  not  identified  could significantly  impact  project  plans.  Such  impacts  could  include  timing  of projects,  including  potential  for  project  cancellation.  Failure  to  adhere  to project  budgets  and  timelines  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## We are  subject  to  commodity  risks  and  other  risks  associated  with energy markets and energy production.\n\nIn the event fuel costs increase, customer demand could decline and bad debt expense may rise, which may have a material impact on our results of operations.  Despite  existing  fuel  recovery  mechanisms  in  most  of  our states, higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations if costs are not recovered. Delays in the timing of the collection of fuel cost recoveries could impact our cash flows and liquidity.\n\nA significant disruption in supply could cause us to seek alternative supply services at potentially higher costs and supply shortages may not be fully resolved, which could cause disruptions in our ability to provide services to our customers. Failure to provide service due to disruptions may also result in  fines,  penalties  or  cost  disallowances  through  the  regulatory  process. Also, significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to sales commitments could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations.\n\nWe  also  engage  in  wholesale  sales  and  purchases  of  electric  capacity, energy  and  energy-related  products  as  well  as  natural  gas.  In  many markets, emission allowances and/or RECs are also needed to comply with various  statutes  and  commission  rulings.  As  a  result,  we  are  subject  to market supply and commodity price risk.\n\nCommodity price  changes  can  affect  the  value  of  our  commodity  trading derivatives. We mark certain derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily  basis.  Settlements  can  vary  significantly  from  estimated  fair  values recorded and significant changes from the assumptions underlying our fair value estimates could cause earnings variability. The management of risks associated  with  hedging  and  trading  is  based,  in  part,  on  programs  and procedures which utilize historical prices and trends.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from historical pricing, Xcel Energy is unable to fully assure that its risk management programs and procedures would be effective to protect against all significant adverse market deviations.\n\nIn addition, Xcel Energy cannot fully assure that its controls will be effective against all potential risks, including, without limitation, employee misconduct.  If  such  programs  and  procedures  are  not  effective,  Xcel Energy's  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows  could  be materially impacted.",

In  addition, specialized  knowledge  is  required  of  our  technical  employees  for construction  and  operation  of  transmission,  generation  and  distribution assets,  which  may  pose  additional  difficulty  for  us  as  we  work  to  recruit, retain  and  motivate  employees  in  this  climate.  Failure  to  hire  and adequately  train  replacement  employees,  including  the  transfer  of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to  manage and operate our business. Inability to attract  and  retain  these employees  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations,  financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Our operations use third-party contractors in addition to employees to perform periodic and ongoing work.\n\nWe rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance and construction  work.  Our  contractual  arrangements  with  these  contractors typically  include  performance  standards,  progress  payments,  insurance requirements  and  security  for  performance.  Poor  vendor  performance  or contractor  unavailability  could  impact  ongoing  operations,  restoration operations, our reputation and could introduce financial risk or risks of fines.\n\n## Our  employees,  directors,  third-party  contractors,  or  suppliers  may violate or be perceived to violate our Codes of Conduct, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation.\n\nWe are exposed to risk of employee or third-party contractor fraud or other misconduct.  All  employees  and  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  are subject to comply with our Code of Conduct and are required to participate in  annual  training.  Additionally,  suppliers  are  subject  to  comply  with  our supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nXcel  Energy  does  not  tolerate  discrimination,  violations  of  our  Code  of Conduct  or  other  unacceptable  behaviors.  However,  it  is  not  always possible  to  identify  and  deter  misconduct  by  employees  and  other  thirdparties,  which  may  result  in  governmental  investigations,  other  actions  or lawsuits.  If  such  actions  are  taken  against  us  we  may  suffer  loss  of reputation  and  such  actions  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Our  subsidiary,  NSP-Minnesota,  is  subject  to  the  risks  of  nuclear generation.\n\nNSP-Minnesota has two nuclear generation plants, PI and Monticello. Risks of nuclear generation include:\n\n- \u00b7 Hazards  associated  with  the  use  of  radioactive  material  in  energy production, including management, handling, storage and disposal.\n- \u00b7 Limitations  on  insurance  available  to  cover  losses  that  may  arise  in connection with nuclear operations, as well as obligations to contribute to  an  insurance  pool  in  the  event  of  damages  at  a  covered  U.S. reactor.\n- \u00b7 Technological  and  financial  uncertainties  related  to  the  costs  of decommissioning nuclear plants may cause our funding obligations to change.\n\nThe NRC has authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for  the  operation  of  nuclear  generation  facilities,  including  the  ability  to impose fines  and/or  shut  down  a  unit  until  compliance  is  achieved.  NRC safety  requirements  could  necessitate  substantial  capital  expenditures  or an  increase  in  operating  expenses.  In  addition,  the  INPO  reviews  NSPMinnesota's nuclear operations. Compliance with the INPO's recommendations  could  result  in  substantial  capital  expenditures  or  a substantial increase in operating expenses.\n\nIf a nuclear incident did occur, it could have a material impact on our results of operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows.  Furthermore,  noncompliance or the occurrence of a serious incident at other nuclear facilities could  result  in  increased  industry  regulation,  which  may  increase  NSPMinnesota's compliance costs.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nOur  profitability  depends  on  the  ability  of  our  utility  subsidiaries  to recover their costs and changes in regulation may impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs from their customers.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  comprehensive  regulation  by  federal  and  state  utility regulatory agencies, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge customers.\n\nThe  profitability  of  our  utility  operations  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to recover  the  costs  of  providing  energy  and  utility  services  and  earning  a return  on  capital  investment.  Our  rates  are  generally  regulated  and  are based on an analysis of the utility's costs incurred in a test year. The utility subsidiaries are subject to both future and historical test years depending upon the regulatory jurisdiction. Thus, the rates a utility is allowed to charge may  or  may  not  match  its  costs  at  any  given  time.  Rate  regulation  is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\n\nThere can also be no assurance that our regulatory commissions will judge all  the  costs of our utility subsidiaries to be prudent, which could result in disallowances, or that the regulatory process will always result in rates that will produce full recovery.\n\nOverall,  management  believes  prudently  incurred  costs  are  recoverable given the existing regulatory framework. However, there may be changes in the  regulatory  environment  that  could  impair  the  ability  of  our  utility subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from customers, or these subsidiaries could exceed caps on capital costs required by commissions and result in less than full recovery.\n\nChanges in the long-term cost-effectiveness or to the operating conditions of  our  assets  may  result  in  early  retirements  of  utility  facilities.  While regulation typically provides cost recovery relief for these types of changes, there  is  no  assurance  that  regulators  would  allow  full  recovery  of  all remaining costs.\n\nHigher than expected inflation or tariffs may increase costs of construction and operations. Also, rising fuel costs could increase the risk that our utility subsidiaries  will  not  be  able  to  fully  recover  their  fuel  costs  from  their customers.\n\nAdverse regulatory rulings or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and materially affect our  ability  to  meet  our  financial  obligations,  including  debt  payments  and the payment of dividends on common stock.",

        "page_content": "## Any  reductions  in  our  credit  ratings  could  increase  our  financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.\n\nWe cannot be assured that our current credit  ratings  or  our  subsidiaries' ratings will remain in effect, or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency. Significant events including disallowance of costs, use of  historic  test  years,  elimination  of  riders  or  interim  rates,  increasing depreciation  lives,  lower  returns  on  equity,  changes  to  equity  ratios  and impacts  of  tax  policy  may  impact  our  cash  flows  and  credit  metrics, potentially resulting in a change in our credit ratings. In addition, our credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies.\n\nAny credit ratings downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs or lower proceeds from equity issuances. It could also impact our ability to access capital markets. Also, our utility subsidiaries may enter into contracts that require  posting  of  collateral  or  settlement  if  credit  ratings  fall  below investment grade.\n\n## We are subject to capital market and interest rate risks.\n\nUtility  operations  require  significant  capital  investment.  As  a  result,  we frequently need to access capital markets. Any disruption in capital markets could have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations.  Capital market  disruption  and  financial  market  distress  could  prevent  us  from issuing short-term commercial paper, issuing new securities or cause us to issue  securities  with  unfavorable  terms  and  conditions,  such  as  higher interest  rates  or  lower  proceeds  from  equity  issuances.  Higher  interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nThe  performance  of  capital  markets  impacts  the  value  of  assets  held  in trusts  to  satisfy  future  obligations  to  decommission  NSP-Minnesota's nuclear plants and satisfy our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit    plan  obligations.  These  assets  are  subject  to  market  fluctuations and  yield  uncertain  returns,  which  may  fall  below  expected  returns.  A decline  in  the  market  value  of  these  assets  may  increase  funding requirements. Additionally, the fair value of the debt securities held in the nuclear  decommissioning  and/or  pension  trusts  may  be  impacted  by changes in interest rates.\n\n## We are subject to credit risks.\n\nCredit risk includes the risk that our customers will not pay their bills, which may lead to a reduction in liquidity and an increase in bad debt expense. Credit risk is comprised of numerous factors including the price of products and services provided, the economy and unemployment rates.\n\nCredit risk also includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or product will become insolvent and may breach their obligations. Should the counterparties  fail  to  perform,  we  may  be  forced  to  enter  into  alternative arrangements.  In  that  event,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely affected and incur losses.\n\nXcel Energy may have direct credit exposure in our short-term wholesale and commodity trading activity to financial institutions trading for their own accounts or issuing collateral support on behalf of other counterparties. We may  also  have  some  indirect  credit  exposure  due  to  participation  in organized  markets,  (e.g.,  California  Independent  System  Operator,  SPP, PJM Interconnection, LLC, MISO and Electric Reliability Council of Texas), in which any credit losses are socialized to all market participants.\n\nWe  have  additional  indirect  credit  exposure  to  financial  institutions  from letters  of  credit  provided  as  security  by  power  suppliers  under  various purchased power contracts. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the supplier would need to replace that security with an acceptable substitute. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract.\n\n## Increasing costs of our defined benefit retirement plans and employee benefits  may  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations,  financial condition or cash flows.\n\nWe have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that cover most of our  employees.  Assumptions  related  to  future  costs,  return  on investments,  interest  rates  and  other  actuarial  assumptions  have  a significant  impact  on  our  funding  requirements  of  these  plans.  Estimates and assumptions may change. In addition, the Pension Protection Act sets the  minimum  funding  requirements  for  defined  benefit  pension  plans. Therefore, our funding requirements and contributions may change in the future. Also, the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year, due to high numbers of retirements or employees leaving, would  trigger  settlement  accounting  and  could  require  Xcel  Energy  to recognize  incremental  pension  expense  related  to  unrecognized  plan losses in the year liabilities are paid. Changes in industry standards utilized in  key assumptions (e.g., mortality tables) could have a significant impact on future obligations and benefit costs.\n\n## Increasing  costs  associated  with  health  care  plans  may  adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIncreasing levels  of  large  individual  health  care  claims  and  overall  health care  claims  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  results  of  operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows.  Health  care  legislation  could  also significantly impact our benefit programs and costs.\n\n## We  must  rely  on  cash  from  our  subsidiaries  to  make  dividend payments.\n\nInvestments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Substantially all of our  operations  are  conducted  by  our  subsidiaries.  Consequently,  our operating  cash  flow  and  ability  to  service  our  debt  and  pay  dividends depends  upon  the  operating  cash  flows  of  our  subsidiaries  and  their payment of dividends.\n\nOur subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any  amounts  due  pursuant  to  our  obligations  or  to  make  any  funds available for dividends on our common stock. In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends depends on statutory and/or contractual restrictions which  may  include  requirements  to  maintain  minimum  levels  of  equity ratios, working capital or assets.\n\nIf  the  utility  subsidiaries  were  to  cease  making  dividend  payments,  our ability  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock  or  otherwise  meet  our financial obligations could be adversely affected. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated  by  state  utility  commissions,  which  possess  broad  powers  to ensure  that  the  needs  of  the  utility  customers  are  met.  We  may  be negatively  impacted  by  the  actions  of  state  commissions  that  limit  the payment of dividends by our utility subsidiaries.",

        "page_content": "## Federal tax law may significantly impact our business.\n\nOur  utility  subsidiaries  collect  estimated  federal,  state  and  local  tax payments  through  their  regulated  rates.  Changes  to  federal  tax  law  may benefit  or  adversely  affect  our  earnings  and  customer  costs.  Tax depreciable  lives  and  the  value/availability  of  various  tax  credits  or  the timeliness  of  their  utilization  may  impact  the  economics  or  selection  of resources. If tax rates are increased, there could be timing delays before regulated rates provide for recovery of such tax increases in revenues. In addition, certain IRS tax policies, such as tax normalization, may impact our ability to economically deliver certain types of resources relative to market prices.\n\n## Macroeconomic Risks\n\n## Economic conditions impact our business.\n\nXcel  Energy's  operations  are  affected  by  local,  national  and  worldwide economic conditions, which correlates to customers/sales growth (decline). Economic  conditions  may  be  impacted  by  insufficient  financial  sector liquidity  leading  to  potential  increased  unemployment,  which  may  impact customers' ability to pay their bills, which could lead to additional bad debt expense.\n\nOur  utility  subsidiaries  face  competitive  factors,  which  could  have  an adverse impact on our financial condition , results  of  operations  and  cash flows. Further, worldwide economic activity impacts the demand for basic commodities necessary for utility infrastructure, which may inhibit our ability to acquire sufficient supplies. We operate in a capital-intensive industry and federal trade policy could significantly impact the cost of materials we use. There  may  be  delays  before  these  additional  material  costs  can  be recovered in rates.\n\n## We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which may  have  a  material  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe  global  outbreak  of  COVID-19  continues  to  impact  countries, communities,  supply  chains  and  markets.  A  high  degree  of  uncertainty continues to exist regarding the pandemic; the duration and magnitude of business restrictions (domestically and globally); the potential shortages of employees  and  third-party  contractors  due  to  quarantine  policies, vaccination requirements or government restrictions; re-shutdowns, if any, and the level and pace of economic recovery.\n\nXcel  Energy  has  experienced  and  may  continue  to  experience  sales volatility  and  shifts  between  residential  and  C&I  sales  as  a  result  of COVID-19.  Xcel  Energy  has  a  decoupling  mechanism  in  Colorado  for residential  and  non-demand  small  C&I  electric  customer  classes.  In Minnesota, Xcel Energy has historically had a sales true-up mechanism for all electric customer classes which has ended in 2021. We are requesting implementation of a new sales true-up mechanism for 2022 - 2024. These mechanisms mitigate the impact of changes to sales levels as compared to a baseline.\n\nAlthough the financial impact of the pandemic on our financial results has largely been mitigated, we cannot ultimately predict whether it will have a material  impact  on  our  future  liquidity,  financial  condition  or  results  of operations. Nor can we predict the impact of the virus on the health of our employees,  our  supply  chain  or  our  ability  to  recover  higher  costs associated with managing through the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 may exacerbate other risks discussed herein, which could have a material effect on us. The situation is evolving and additional impacts may arise.\n\n## Operations could be impacted by war, terrorism or other events.\n\nOur generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities  and  information  and  control  systems  may  be  targets  of  terrorist activities. Any disruption could impact operations or result in a decrease in revenues  and  additional  costs  to  repair  and  insure  our  assets.  These disruptions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nThe potential for terrorism has subjected our operations to increased risks and could have a material effect on our business. We have already incurred increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks. The insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the availability of insurance may decrease. In addition, insurance may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.\n\nA disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, interstate natural gas pipeline  infrastructure  or  other  fuel  sources,  could  negatively  impact  our business,  brand  and  reputation.  Because  our  facilities  are  part  of  an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the actions of a neighboring utility.\n\nWe also face the risks of possible loss of business due to significant events such as severe storms, severe temperature extremes, wildfires (particularly in  Colorado),  widespread  pandemic,  generator  or  transmission  facility outage,  pipeline  rupture,  railroad  disruption,  operator  error,  sudden  and significant  increase  or  decrease  in  wind  generation  or  a  workforce disruption.\n\nIn addition, major catastrophic events throughout the world may disrupt our business. Xcel Energy participates in a global supply chain, which includes materials and components that are globally sourced. A prolonged disruption could result in the delay of equipment and materials that may impact our ability to reliably serve our customers.\n\nA major disruption could result in  a  significant  decrease  in  revenues  and additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nXcel  Energy  participates  in  GridEx,  which  is  the  largest  grid  security exercise in North America. These efforts, led by the NERC, test and further develop  the  coordination,  threat  sharing  and  interaction  between  utilities and various government agencies relative to potential cyber and physical threats against the nation's electric grid.\n\n## A  cyber  incident  or  security  breach  could  have  a  material  effect  on our business.\n\nWe  operate  in  an  industry  that  requires  the  continued  operation  of sophisticated information technology, control systems  and  network infrastructure. In addition, we use our systems and infrastructure to create, collect,  use,  disclose,  store,  dispose  of  and  otherwise  process  sensitive information,  including  company  data,  customer  energy  usage  data,  and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, shareholders and other individuals.\n\nXcel  Energy's  generation,  transmission,  distribution  and  fuel  storage facilities,  information  technology  systems  and  other  infrastructure  or physical  assets  as  well  as  information  processed  in  our  systems  (e.g., information regarding our customers, employees, operations, infrastructure and assets) could be affected by cyber security incidents, including those caused by human error.",

        "page_content": "The  utility  industry  has  been  the  target  of  several  attacks  on  operational systems  and  has  seen  an  increased  volume  and  sophistication  of  cyber security  incidents  from  international  activist  organizations,  Nation  States and  individuals.  During  the  normal  course  of  business,  we  have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other  assets.  To  date,  no  cybersecurity  incident  or  attack  has  had  a material impact on our business or results of operation.\n\nCyber  security  incidents  could  harm  our  businesses  by  limiting  our generating, transmitting and distributing capabilities, delaying our development  and  construction  of  new  facilities  or  capital  improvement projects to existing facilities, disrupting our customer operations or causing the release of customer information, all of which would likely receive state and federal regulatory scrutiny and could expose us to liability.\n\nXcel Energy's generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cyber security incident of the regional electric transmission grid, natural  gas  pipeline  infrastructure  or  other  fuel  sources  of  our  third-party service providers' operations, could also negatively impact our business.\n\nOur  supply  chain  for  procurement  of  digital  equipment  and  services  may expose software or hardware to these risks and could result in a breach or significant  costs  of  remediation.  We  are  unable  to  quantify  the  potential impact  of  cyber  security  threats  or  subsequent  related  actions.  Cyber security incidents and regulatory action could result in a material decrease in  revenues  and  may  cause significant  additional  costs  (e.g.,  penalties, third-party claims, repairs, insurance or compliance) and potentially disrupt our supply and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.\n\nWe maintain security measures to protect our information technology and control  systems,  network  infrastructure  and  other  assets.  However,  these assets  and  the  information  they  process  may  be  vulnerable  to  cyber security incidents, including asset failure or unauthorized access to assets or information.\n\nA  failure  or  breach  of  our  technology  systems  or  those  of  our  third-party service  providers  could  disrupt  critical  business  functions  and  may negatively impact our business, our brand, and our reputation. The cyber security  threat  is  dynamic  and  evolves  continually,  and  our  efforts  to prioritize  network  protection  may  not  be  effective  given  the  constant changes to threat vulnerability.\n\n## Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by milder weather.\n\nOur electric  and  natural  gas  utility  businesses  are  seasonal  and  weather patterns  can  have  a  material  impact  on  our  operating  performance. Demand for electricity  is  often  greater  in  the  summer  and  winter  months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand depends heavily upon weather  patterns.  A  significant  amount  of  natural  gas  revenues  are recognized  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  related  to  the  heating  season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer.  Unusually  mild  winters  and  summers  could  have  an  adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Public Policy Risks\n\n## We may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.\n\nLegislative and regulatory responses related to climate change may create financial  risk  as  our  facilities  may  be  subject  to  additional  regulation  at either the state or federal level in the future. International agreements could additionally lead to future federal or state regulations.\n\nIn  2015,  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change reached  consensus  among  190  nations  on  an  agreement  (the  Paris Agreement) that establishes a framework for GHG mitigation actions by all countries, with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2\u00ba Celsius above pre-industrial levels and an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5\u00ba Celsius.\n\nIn April 2021, ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow,  the  Biden  Administration  committed  the  U.S.  to  a  Nationally Determined  Contribution  of  50-52%  net  GHG  emissions  reduction economy-wide from 2005 levels. This commitment and other agreements made in Glasgow could result in  future  additional  GHG  reductions  in  the United States. In addition, the Biden Administration has announced plans to implement new climate change programs, including potential regulation of GHG emissions targeting the utility industry.\n\nMany  states  and  localities  continue  to  pursue  their  own  climate  policies. The  steps  Xcel  Energy  has  taken  to  date  to  reduce  GHG  emissions, including  energy  efficiency  measures,  adding  renewable  generation  or retiring  or  converting  coal  plants  to  natural  gas,  occurred  under  stateendorsed  resource  plans,  renewable  energy  standards  and  other  state policies.\n\nWe may be subject to climate change lawsuits. An adverse outcome could require  substantial  capital  expenditures  and  possibly  require  payment  of substantial  penalties  or  damages.  Defense  costs  associated  with  such litigation  can  also  be  significant  and  could  affect  results  of  operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows  if  such  costs  are  not  recovered  through regulated rates.\n\nIf our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the O&M costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have  a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or cash flows.\n\n## Increased  risks  of  regulatory  penalties  could  negatively  impact  our business.\n\nThe  Energy  Act  increased  civil  penalty  authority  for  violation  of  FERC statutes, rules and orders. The FERC can impose penalties of up to $1.3 million  per  violation  per  day,  particularly  as  it  relates  to  energy  trading activities  for  both  electricity  and  natural  gas.  In  addition,  NERC  electric reliability  standards  and  critical  infrastructure  protection  requirements  are mandatory and subject to potential  financial  penalties.  Also,  the  PHMSA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to assess penalties.\n\nIn the event of serious incidents, these agencies may pursue penalties. In addition, certain states have the authority to impose substantial penalties. If a  serious  reliability,  cyber  or  safety  incident  did  occur,  it  could  have  a material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash flows.",

        "page_content": "The continued use of natural gas for both power generation and gas distribution  have  increasingly  become  a  public  policy  advocacy target.  These  efforts  may  result  in  a  limitation  of  natural  gas  as  an energy  source  for  both  power  generation  and  heating,  which  could impact our ability to reliably and affordably serve our customers.\n\nIn recent years, there have been various local and state agency proposals within and outside our service territories that would attempt to restrict the use and availability of natural gas. If such policies were to prevail, we may be  forced  to  make  new  resource  investment  decisions  which  could potentially result in stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments and impact the overall reliability of our service.\n\n## Environmental Risks\n\n## We  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  with  which compliance could be difficult and costly.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations  that  affect  many aspects  of  our  operations,  including  air  emissions,  water  quality, wastewater discharges and the generation, transport and disposal of solid wastes  and  hazardous  substances.  Laws  and  regulations  require  us  to obtain  permits,  licenses,  and  approvals  and  to  comply  with  a  variety  of environmental requirements.\n\nEnvironmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of facilities or the use of certain fuels, shift generation to loweremitting  facilities,  install  pollution  control  equipment,  clean  up  spills  and other  contamination  and  correct  environmental  hazards.  Failure  to  meet requirements of environmental mandates may result in fines or penalties. We may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where  our  past  activities,  or  the  activities  of  other  parties,  caused environmental contamination.\n\nChanges in environmental policies and regulations or regulatory decisions may result in early retirements of our generation facilities. While regulation typically provides relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  mandates  to  provide  customers  with  clean  energy, renewable  energy  and  energy  conservation  offerings.  It  could  have  a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if our regulators do not allow us to recover the cost of capital investment or O&M costs incurred to comply with the requirements.\n\nIn addition, existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new  laws  or  regulations  may  be  adopted.  We  may  also  incur  additional unanticipated  obligations  or  liabilities  under  existing  environmental  laws and regulations.\n\nWe are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change  and  other  weather,  natural  disaster  and  resource  depletion impacts.\n\nClimate  change  can  create  physical  and  financial  risk.  Physical  risks include  changes  in  weather  conditions  and  extreme  weather  events.  Our customers'  energy  needs  vary  with  weather.  To  the  extent  weather conditions  are  affected  by  climate  change,  customers'  energy  use  could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require  us  to  invest  in  generating  assets,  transmission  and  infrastructure. Decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues.\n\nClimate  change  may  impact  the  economy,  which  could  impact  our  sales and revenues. The price of energy has an impact on the economic health of our communities. The cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation  of  GHG,  could  impact  the  availability  of  goods  and  prices charged  by  our  suppliers  which  would  normally  be  borne  by  consumers through higher prices for energy and purchased goods.\n\nTo  the  extent  financial  markets  view  climate  change  and  emissions  of GHGs as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.\n\nWe have committed to a number of long-term climate change goals, which in  part  are  dependent  on  future  technologies  not  currently  in  existence. Given the long-term nature of these goals, there is an inherent uncertainty due  to  internal  and  external  factors  regarding  our  ability  to  achieve  our stated  climate  change  goals.  To  the  extent  climate  change  goals  are  not met,  this  could  negatively  impact  our  reputation  and  potentially  result  in financial risk.\n\nSevere weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, flooding, tornadoes, wildfires and snow or ice storms occur. Extreme  weather  conditions  in  general  require  system  backup  and  can contribute  to  increased  system  stress,  including  service  interruptions. Extreme  weather  conditions  creating  high  energy  demand  may  raise electricity  prices,  increasing  the  cost  of  energy  we  provide  to  our customers.\n\nTo  the  extent  the  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events  increases,  this could  increase  our  cost  of  providing  service.  Periods  of  extreme temperatures  could  impact  our  ability  to  meet  demand.  Changes  in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages could adversely affect our operations. Drought conditions also contribute to the increase in wildfire risk from our electric generation facilities.\n\nWhile we carry liability insurance, given an extreme event, if Xcel Energy was  found  to  be  liable  for  wildfire  damages,  amounts  that  potentially exceed  our  coverage  could  negatively  impact  our  results  of  operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nDrought  or  water  depletion  could  adversely  impact  our  ability  to  provide electricity  to  customers,  cause  early  retirement  of  power  plants  and increase  the  cost  for  energy.  Adverse  events  may  result  in  increased insurance  costs  and/or  decreased  insurance  availability.  We  may  not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.\n\n## ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.",

The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility,  and  whether  the  loss  or  a  range  of  loss  is  estimable,  often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management maintains  accruals  for  losses  probable  of  being  incurred  and  subject  to reasonable estimation.\n\nManagement  is  sometimes  unable  to  estimate  an  amount  or  range  of  a reasonably  possible  loss  in  certain  situations,  including  but  not  limited  to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In  such  cases,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  the  timing  or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.\n\nFor current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on  Xcel  Energy's  consolidated  financial  statements.  Legal  fees  are generally expensed as incurred.\n\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, Item 1 and Item 7 for further information.\n\n## ITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nNone.\n\n## PART II\n\n## ITEM  5  -  MARKET  FOR  REGISTRANT'S  COMMON  EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\n\n## Stock Data\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  common  stock  is  listed  on  the  Nasdaq  Global  Select Market  (Nasdaq).

        "page_content": "## Purchases of Equity Securities by Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\n\nFor  the  quarter  ended  Dec.  31,  2021,  no  equity  securities  that  are registered  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  pursuant  to  Section  12  of  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were purchased by or on behalf of us or any of our affiliated purchasers.\n\n## ITEM 6 - [RESERVED]\n\n## ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe  following  discussion  includes  financial  information  prepared  in accordance with GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such  as  ongoing  ROE,  ongoing  earnings  and  ongoing  diluted  EPS. Generally,  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure  is  a  measure  of  a  company's financial  performance,  financial  position  or  cash  flows  that  excludes  (or includes)  amounts  that  are  adjusted  from  measures  calculated  and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nXcel  Energy's  management  uses  non-GAAP  measures  for  financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining  performance-based  compensation  and  communicating  its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are  intended  to  supplement  investors'  understanding  of  our  performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in  accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies' similarly titled nonGAAP financial measures.\n\n## Ongoing ROE\n\nOngoing  ROE  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  net  income  or  loss  of  Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's  average  stockholder's  equity.  We  use  these  non-GAAP  financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.\n\n## Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)\n\nGAAP  diluted  EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents)  were  settled.  The  weighted  average  number  of  potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.'s diluted EPS is  calculated  using  the  treasury  stock  method.  Ongoing  earnings  reflect adjustments  to  GAAP  earnings  (net  income)  for  certain  items.  Ongoing diluted  EPS  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  net  income  or  loss  of  each subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel  Energy  Inc.  common  shares  outstanding  for  the  period.  Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.\n\nWe  use  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  to  evaluate  and  provide details  of  Xcel  Energy's  core  earnings  and  underlying  performance.  We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and  projected  financial  performance  and  contribution  of  our  subsidiaries. For  the  years  ended  Dec.  31,  2021  and  2020,  there  were  no  such adjustments  to  GAAP  earnings  and  therefore  GAAP  earnings  equal ongoing earnings.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\nDiluted EPS for Xcel Energy at Dec. 31:\n\n| Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share               | 2021 GAAP and  Ongoing Diluted  EPS   | 2020 GAAP and  Ongoing Diluted  EPS   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| PSCo                                            | $  1.22                               | $  1.11                               |\n| NSP-Minnesota                                   | 1.12                                  | 1.12                                  |\n| SPS                                             | 0.59                                  | 0.56                                  |\n| NSP-Wisconsin                                   | 0.20                                  | 0.20                                  |\n| Earnings from equity method investments -  WYCO | 0.05                                  | 0.05                                  |\n| Regulated utility  (a)                          | 3.18                                  | 3.04                                  |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. and Other                      | (0.22)                                | (0.25)                                |\n| Total  (a)                                      | $  2.96                               | $  2.79                               |\n\nXcel  Energy's  management  believes  that  ongoing  earnings  reflects management's  performance  in  operating  Xcel  Energy  and  provides  a meaningful  representation  of  the  performance  of  Xcel  Energy's  core business.  In  addition,  Xcel  Energy's  management  uses  ongoing  earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, reporting results to the Board of Directors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.\n\n## 2021 Comparison with 2020\n\nXcel Energy - GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.17 per share for 2021.  The  increase  was  driven  by  capital  investment  recovery  and  other regulatory outcomes, partially offset by increases in depreciation and lower AFUDC. Fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes  in  fuel  and  purchased  power  and/or  natural  gas  sold  and transported  generally  do  not  significantly  impact  earnings  (changes  in revenues are offset by the related variation in costs).\n\nPSCo -  Earnings  increased  $0.11  per  share  for  2021,  driven  by  capital investment recovery and other regulatory outcomes. Higher revenues were partially offset by increased depreciation, O&M expenses and other taxes (other than income taxes).\n\nNSP-Minnesota -  Earnings  were  flat  for  2021  compared  to  2020, reflecting capital investment recovery offset by additional depreciation and interest charges.\n\nSPS -  Earnings  increased  $0.03  per  share  for  2021,  largely  related  to capital  investment  recovery,  other  regulatory  outcomes  and  higher  sales and demand, partially offset by decreased AFUDC.\n\nNSP-Wisconsin - Earnings were flat for 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other -  Primarily  includes  financing  costs  at  the holding company, offset by earnings from EIP investments.",

The estimated  impact  of  weather  on  earnings  is  based  on  the  number  of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related  operating  expenses  that  could  result  due  to  storm  activity  or vegetation management requirements. As a result, weather deviations from normal  levels  can  affect  Xcel  Energy's  financial  performance.  However, sales  true-up  and  decoupling  mechanisms  in  Minnesota  and  Colorado predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather.\n\nDegree-day or THI data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain  comfortable  indoor  temperature  levels  based  on  each  day's average temperature and humidity. HDD is the measure of the variation in the  weather  based  on  the  extent  to  which  the  average  daily  temperature falls  below  65\u00b0  Fahrenheit.  CDD  is  the  measure  of  the  variation  in  the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is  counted  as  one  CDD,  and  each  degree  of  temperature  below  65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one HDD. In Xcel Energy's more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD.  HDD,  CDD  and  THI  are  most  likely  to  impact  the  usage  of  Xcel Energy's  residential  and  commercial  customers.  Industrial  customers  are less sensitive to weather.\n\nNormal  weather  conditions  are  defined  as  either  the  10,  20  or  30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory  practice.  To  calculate  the  impact  of  weather  on  demand,  a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations,  windchill  and  cloud  cover  may  not  be  reflected  in  weathernormalized estimates.\n\nPercentage (decrease) increase in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI:\n\n|     | 2021 vs. Normal   | 2020 vs. Normal   | 2021 vs. 2020   |\n|-----|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| HDD | (6.6) %           | (3.1) %           | (4.3) %         |\n| CDD | 12.2              | 22.2              | (9.2)           |\n| THI | 26.8              | 6.3               | 20.7            |\n\nWeather -

        "page_content": "## Weather-normalized  and  leap-year  adjusted  electric  sales  growth (decline) - year-to-date\n\nWeather-adjusted sales results for each of our utility subsidiaries in 2021 reflect  improving  economies  as  the  adverse  effects  of  COVID-19  lessen. The  recovery  reflects  increased  sales  in  the  C&I  sector  as  businesses return to a more normal level. Residential sales remain elevated from prepandemic levels due to continuance of individuals working from home.\n\n- \u00b7 PSCo  -  Residential  sales  rose  based  on  a  1.2%  increase  in customers, combined with higher use per customer. The growth in C&I sales  was  due  to  a  1.2%  increase  in  customers,  partially  offset  by slightly lower use per customer, primarily in the services sector.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota - Residential sales growth reflects a 1.2% increase in customers, partially offset by a lower use per customer. The growth in C&I sales was due to a 0.9% increase in customers and higher use per  customer,  primarily  in  the  manufacturing,  retail  and  services sectors.\n- \u00b7 SPS - Residential sales declined as lower use per customer offset a 0.9%  increase  in  customers.  C&I  sales  increased  due  to  a  0.5% increase in customers and higher use per customer, primarily driven by the oil and gas and professional services sectors.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Wisconsin - Residential sales growth was attributable to a 0.8% increase in customer additions, partially offset by slightly lower use per customer.  The  growth  in  C&I  sales  was  due  to  a  1.1%  increase  in customers,  primarily  led  by  increases  in  the  manufacturing,  health care and retail trade sectors.\n\n## Weather-normalized and leap-year adjusted natural gas sales growth (decline) - year-to-date\n\n- \u00b7 Natural  gas  sales  primarily  reflect  a  1.2%  increase  in  residential customers and a 0.5% increase in C&I customers, partially offset by a decrease in use per customer.\n\n## Electric Margin\n\nElectric  margin  is  presented  as  electric  revenues  less  electric  fuel  and purchased  power  expenses.  Expenses  incurred  for  electric  fuel  and purchased  power  are  generally  recovered  through  various  regulatory recovery  mechanisms.  As  a  result,  changes  in  these  expenses  are generally offset in operating revenues.\n\nElectric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium. However, these price fluctuations generally have minimal impact on earnings impact due to fuel recovery mechanisms. In addition, electric customers receive a credit for PTCs generated, which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.\n\n## Electric Revenues, Fuel and Purchased Power and Electric Margin\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | 2021      | 2020     |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Electric revenues                 | $  11,205 | $  9,802 |\n| Electric fuel and purchased power | (4,733)   | (3,512)  |\n| Electric margin                   | $  6,472  | $  6,290 |\n\n## Changes in Electric Margin\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                                   | 2021 vs. 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Non-fuel riders                                                                         | $  221          |\n| Regulatory rate outcomes (Texas, Wisconsin, Colorado, New Mexico  and North Dakota) (a) | 114             |\n| Proprietary commodity trading, net of sharing                                           | 40              |\n| Sales and demand  (b)                                                                   | 29              |\n| PTCs flowed back to customers (offset by lower ETR)                                     | (149)           |\n| Texas 2019 rate case surcharge  (c)                                                     | (70)            |\n| Estimated impact of weather (net of decoupling/sales true-up)                           | (12)            |\n| Other (net)                                                                             | 9               |\n| Increase in electric margin                                                             | $  182          |\n\n## Natural Gas Margin\n\nNatural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported.

Increases  for  distribution,  wind  farm  maintenance  and  technology  costs were offset by a decrease in employee benefits expense (e.g., long term incentives),  additional  Texas  2021  rate  case  deferrals  and  the  year-overyear  impact  of  amounts  associated  with  the  Texas  2019  rate  case surcharge.\n\nDepreciation  and  Amortization -Depreciation and  amortization increased $173 million year-to-date. The increase was primarily driven by several  wind  farms  going  into  service,  normal  system  expansion  and  the implementation of new depreciation rates in various states.",

        "page_content": "Other Income (Expense) -Other income (expense) increased $11 million year-to-date. The change was largely related to gains associated with rabbi trust performance (offset in O&M expenses).\n\nAFUDC, Equity and Debt - AFUDC decreased $58 million year-to-date. The decrease was driven by completion of various wind projects throughout 2020 and 2021.\n\nInterest  Charges -Interest  charges  increased  $2  million  year-to-date. The  increase  was  largely  due  to  higher  debt  levels  to  fund  capital investments,  partially  offset  by  lower  long-term  and  short-term  interest rates.\n\nEarnings  from  Equity  Method  Investments -Earnings  from  equity method  investments  increased  $22  million  year-to-date.  The  year-to-date change was largely attributable to the performance of the EIP funds, which invest in energy technology companies.\n\nIncome Taxes -Income  tax  benefit  increased  $64  million  year-to-date. The change was driven by an increase in wind PTCs due to additional wind facilities  going  into  service.  Impact  of  PTCs  was  partially  offset  by  an increase  in  pretax  earnings,  lower  plant  regulatory  differences  and  lower non-plant accumulated deferred income tax amortization.\n\n## Xcel Energy Inc. and Other Results\n\nNet  income  and  diluted  EPS  contributions  of  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its nonregulated businesses:\n\n|                                          | Contribution (Millions of Dollars)   | Contribution (Millions of Dollars)   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2021                                 | 2020                                 |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs         | $  (129)                             | $  (147)                             |\n| MEC  (a)                                 | -                                    | 15                                   |\n| Venture Holdings  (b)                    | 21                                   | 4                                    |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results | (12)                                 | (5)                                  |\n| Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs   | $  (120)                             | $  (133)                             |\n\n|                                          | Contribution (Diluted Earnings  (Loss) Per Share)   | Contribution (Diluted Earnings  (Loss) Per Share)   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2021                                                | 2020                                                |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs         | $  (0.24)                                           | $  (0.28)                                           |\n| MEC  (a)                                 | -                                                   | 0.03                                                |\n| Venture Holdings  (b)                    | 0.04                                                | 0.01                                                |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results | (0.02)                                              | (0.01)                                              |\n| Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs   | $  (0.22)                                           | $  (0.25)                                           |\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  results  include  interest  charges,  which  are  incurred  at Xcel Energy Inc. and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries.\n\n## 2020 Comparison with 2019\n\nA discussion of changes in Xcel Energy's results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and capital resources from the year ended Dec. 31, 2019 to Dec. 31, 2020 can be found in Part II, 'Item 7, Management's Discussion and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations'  of  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2020, which was filed with the SEC on Feb. 17, 2021. However, such discussion is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Public Utility Regulation\n\nThe  FERC  and  various  state  and  local  regulatory  commissions  regulate Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries and West Gas Interstate. Xcel Energy is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies  in  Minnesota,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nRates  are  designed  to  recover  plant  investment,  operating  costs  and  an allowed  return  on  investment.  Our  utility  subsidiaries  request  changes  in utility  rates  through  commission  filings.  Changes  in  operating  costs  can affect Xcel Energy's financial results, depending on the timing of rate cases and  implementation  of  final  rates.  Other  factors  affecting  rate  filings  are new  investments,  sales,  conservation  and  DSM  efforts,  and  the  cost  of capital.\n\nIn addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the ROE, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy's results of operations.\n\nSee Rate Matters within Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## NSP-Minnesota\n\n## Summary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\n\n| Regulatory Body / RTO                     | Additional Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                           | Retail  rates,  services,  security  issuances,  property  transfers,  mergers,  disposition  of  assets,  affiliate  transactions,  and  other  aspects of electric and natural gas operations.

        "page_content": "Minnesota  Relief  and  Recovery -In  2020,  the  MPUC  opened  a  docket and invited utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump start the economy to offset the impacts of COVID-19.\n\nThe status of the various proposals is listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 In  January  2021,  the  MPUC  approved  NSP-Minnesota's  request  for the repowering of 651 MW of owned wind projects and 20 MW of wind projects under PPAs. These projects are estimated to save customers approximately $160 million over the next 25 years.\n- \u00b7 In  April  2021,  NSP-Minnesota  proposed  to  add  460  MW  of  solar facilities  at  the  Sherco  site  with  an  incremental  investment  of approximately  $575  million.  An  MPUC  decision  is  expected  by  the third quarter of 2022.\n- \u00b7 In  June  2021,  the  MPUC  approved  NSP-Minnesota's  proposal  to acquire a repowered wind farm from ALLETE, Inc.\n- \u00b7 The MPUC is also considering NSP-Minnesota's revised proposal to provide $40 million of incremental electric vehicle rebates.\n\nMinnesota  Resource  Plan -In  July  2019,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  its Minnesota resource plan, which runs through 2034.\n\nOn Feb. 8, 2022, the MPUC approved the following:\n\n- \u00b7 10-year extension for the Monticello nuclear facility.\n- \u00b7 Retirement of the A.S. King plant in 2028 and Sherco 3 in 2030.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota ownership of Sherco and A.S. King gen-tie lines plus additional  renewable  resources  on  the  lines  up  to  its  current interconnection  rights  (2,000  MW  for  Sherco  and  600  MW  for  A.S. King).\n- \u00b7 The need for 2,150 MW of new wind and 2,500 MW of new solar by 2032, as well as additional renewable generation of 1,100 MW beyond 2032.\n- \u00b7 Recognition  of  the  need  for  800  MW  of  additional  firm  dispatchable resources between 2027 and 2029. The dispatchable generation will need to be approved through a CON process.\n\nThe next Minnesota resource plan is due on Feb. 1, 2024.\n\n2022 RES Electric Rider  In  November  2021,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  the RES Rider. The requested amount of $264 million includes a true-up (2020 and 2021 riders) of $154 million and the 2022 requested amount of $110 million. The filing included a ROE of 9.06%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\n2021 RES Electric Rider  In  November  2020,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  the RES Rider. The requested amount of $189 million includes a true-up (2019 and  2020  riders)  of  $96  million  and  the  2021  requested  amount  of  $93 million. The filing included a ROE of 9.06%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\n2022 GUIC Natural Gas Rider In October 2021, NSP-Minnesota filed the GUIC Rider for an amount of $27 million based on a ROE of 9.04%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\n2021 GUIC Natural Gas Rider In October 2020, NSP-Minnesota filed the GUIC Rider for an amount of $27 million based on a ROE of 9.04%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\n2022 TCR Electric Rider  In  November  2021,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  the TCR Rider for an amount of $105 million based on a ROE of 9.06%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\n2020 TCR Electric Rider  In  November  2019,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  the TCR Rider for an amount of $82 million based on a ROE of 9.06%, which was approved by the MPUC in December 2021.\n\nFERC NOPR on ROE Incentive Adders - In April 2021, the FERC issued a  NOPR  proposing  to  limit  collection  of  ROE  incentive  adders  for  RTO membership to the first three years after an entity begins participation in an RTO. If adopted as a final rule, NSP-Minnesota (as well as NSP-Wisconsin and SPS) would prospectively discontinue charging their current 50 basis point  ROE  incentive  adders.  Amounts  related  to  a  discontinuance  of  the adder would ultimately be offset by an increase in retail  rates,  subject  to future rate cases.\n\n## Purchased Power Arrangements and Transmission Service Provider\n\nNSP-Minnesota expects to use power plants, power purchases, CIP/DSM options, new generation facilities and expansion of power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.\n\nPurchased Power - NSP-Minnesota has contracts to purchase power from other  utilities and  IPPs.  Long-term  purchased  power  contracts  for dispatchable resources typically require a capacity and an energy charge.\n\nNSP-Minnesota makes short-term purchases to meet system requirements, replace company owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased Transmission Services - NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts with MISO and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.\n\n## Nuclear Power Operations\n\nNuclear  power  plant  operations  produce  gaseous,  liquid  and  solid radioactive  wastes,  which  are  covered  by  federal  regulation.  High-level radioactive  wastes  primarily  include  used  nuclear  fuel.  Low-level  waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment contaminated through use.\n\nNRC  Regulation -  The  NRC  regulates  nuclear  operations.  Costs  of complying with NRC requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital investments of the plants. NSP-Minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs and expects to recover future compliance costs.\n\nLow-Level Waste Disposal - Low level waste disposal from Monticello and PI is  disposed at the Clive facility located in Utah and the Waste Control Specialists facility in Texas. NSP-Minnesota has storage capacity available on-site  at  PI  and  Monticello  which  would  allow  both  plants  to  continue  to operate until the end of their current licensed lives if off-site low-level waste disposal facilities become unavailable.\n\nHigh-Level  Radioactive  Waste  Disposal -  The  federal  government  has responsibility to permanently dispose domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level  radioactive  wastes.  The  Nuclear  Waste  Policy  Act  requires  the DOE to  implement  a  program  for  nuclear  high-level  waste  management. This  includes  the  siting,  licensing,  construction  and  operation  of  a repository  for  spent  nuclear  fuel  from  civilian  nuclear  power  reactors  and other  high-level  radioactive  wastes  at  a  permanent  federal  storage  or disposal  facility.  Currently,  there  are  no  definitive  plans  for  a  permanent federal storage facility site.\n\nNuclear Spent Fuel Storage - NSP-Minnesota has interim on-site storage for  spent  nuclear  fuel  at  its  Monticello  and  PI  nuclear  generating  plants. Authorized storage capacity is sufficient to allow NSP-Minnesota to operate until  the  end  of  the  operating  licenses  in  2030  for  Monticello,  2033  for  PI Unit  1,  and  2034  for  PI  Unit  2.  Authorizations  for  additional  spent  fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either continued operation  or  decommissioning  if  the  federal  government  does  not commence storage operations.",

Once  the  PSCW approves the plan, utilities defer the amount of any fuel  cost under-recovery or over-recovery in excess of a 2% annual  tolerance band, for future rate recovery or refund. Approval of a  fuel cost plan and any rate adjustment for refund or recovery of  deferred  costs  is  determined  by  the  PSCW.  Rate  recovery  of  deferred  fuel  cost  is  subject  to  an  earnings  test  based  on  the  most  recently  authorized  ROE.  Under-collections  that  exceed  the 2% annual tolerance band may not be recovered if the utility  earnings for that year exceed the authorized ROE.

Key elements of the settlement:\n\n- \u00b7 An  increase  in  electric  rates  of  $35  million  (4.9%)  for  2022  and  an incremental $18 million increase (2.5%) for 2023.\n- \u00b7 An increase in natural gas rates of $10 million (8.4%) for 2022 and an incremental $3 million (2.3%) for 2023.\n- \u00b7 ROE of 9.80% for 2022 and 10.00% for 2023.\n- \u00b7 Equity ratio of 52.5% for both 2022 and 2023.\n- \u00b7 Returning  $9  million  in  various  net  regulatory  liabilities  to  offset customer impacts in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Deferring certain pension and other post-employment benefit expense in 2021 through 2023.\n- \u00b7 Incorporating an earnings sharing mechanism for 2022 and 2023.\n\nMichigan Electric Rate Case In January 2022, NSP-Wisconsin reached an electric rate case settlement in principle with the MPSC staff and others. The settlement grants NSP-Wisconsin an electric revenue increase of $1.6 million in 2022, based on a ROE of 9.7% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. The MPSC is expected to rule on the settlement in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Purchased Power and Transmission Services\n\nThe  NSP  System  expects  to  use  power  plants,  power  purchases, conservation and DSM options, new generation facilities and expansion of power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.\n\nPurchased Power - Through the Interchange Agreement, NSP-Wisconsin receives  power  purchased  by  NSP-Minnesota  from  other  utilities  and independent  power  producers.  Long-term  purchased  power  contracts  for dispatchable resources typically require a capacity charge and an energy charge.  NSP-Minnesota  makes  short-term  purchases  to  meet  system requirements, replace company owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased Transmission Services - NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts with MISO and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.",

The total change to base rates is $215 million, reflecting the transfer of  $108  million  previously  recovered  from  customers  through  the  PSIA rider, which was closed to new investments at the end of 2021. The request is based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.66% and a 2022 current test year. PSCo has requested a proposed effective date of Nov. 1, 2022.\n\nAdditionally, PSCo's request includes step revenue increases of $40 million in 2023 (effective Nov. 1, 2023) and $41 million in 2024 (effective Nov. 1, 2024) related to continued capital investment. Under this proposal, PSCo would  not  request  another  base  rate  change  prior  to  Nov.  1,  2025.  An informational historical test year, including a 10.75% ROE, was also filed as required by the CPUC.\n\n| Revenue Request (millions of dollars)                         | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Changes since 2020 rate case:                                 |        |\n| Plant related investments  (a)                                | $  210 |\n| Operations and maintenance, amortization and other expenses   | 11     |\n| Property tax expense                                          | 11     |\n| Sales growth                                                  | (17)   |\n| Net increase to revenue                                       | 215    |\n| Previously authorized costs:                                  |        |\n| Transfer of costs previously recovered through the PSIA rider | (108)  |\n| Total base revenue request                                    | $  107 |\n| Projected 2022 year-end rate base (billions of dollars)       | $  3.6 |\n\nColorado Electric Rate Request -In July 2021, PSCo filed a request with the CPUC seeking a net electric rate increase of $343 million (or 12.4%). The  total  request  reflects  a  $470  million  increase,  which  includes  $127 million  of  previously  authorized  costs  currently  recovered  through  various rider mechanisms. The request is based on a 10.0% ROE, an equity ratio of  55.64%,  a  2022  forecast  test  year,  a  rate  base  of  $10.3  billion  and impacts of a new depreciation study.\n\nIn January 2022, PSCo reached an unopposed comprehensive settlement. The CPUC is expected to rule on the settlement in March 2022 with final rates expected to be effective in April 2022. Key settlement terms include:\n\n- \u00b7 A net electric rate increase of $177 million. The total change in base rates  is  $299  million,  which  includes  $122  million  of  revenue previously collected through various rider mechanisms.\n- \u00b7 A ROE of 9.3% and an equity ratio of 55.69%.\n- \u00b7 A  current  2021  test  year  (average  rate  base)  with  the  transfer  of Cheyenne  Ridge,  Wildfire  Mitigation  Plan  and  Advanced  Grid Intelligence and Security investments at year-end rate base.\n- \u00b7 Approval of all of PSCo's proposed depreciation adjustments.\n- \u00b7 Continuation of the property tax, qualified pension, and non-qualified pension trackers.\n- \u00b7 Continuation  of  Advanced  Grid  Intelligence  and  Security  deferral including  interest  equivalent  to  PSCo's  weighted  average  cost  of capital once the balance exceeds $50 million.\n- \u00b7 Continuation of the Wildfire Mitigation Plan deferral, with a debt return.",

A CPUC  decision  is  expected  in  the  first  quarter  of  2022.  Key  settlement terms include:\n\n- \u00b7 Early retirement of Hayden: Unit 2 in 2027 (was 2036); and Unit 1 in 2028 (was 2030).\n- \u00b7 Conversion of Pawnee to burn natural gas by 2026.\n- \u00b7 Early  retirement  of  Comanche  3  in  2034  with  reduced  operations beginning in 2025.\n- \u00b7 Addition of ~2,300 MW of wind.\n- \u00b7 Addition of ~1,600 MW of utility-scale solar.\n- \u00b7 Addition of 400 MW of storage.\n- \u00b7 Addition of 1,300 MW of flexible, dispatchable generation.\n- \u00b7 Addition  of  ~1,200  MW  of  distributed  solar  resources  through  our renewable energy programs.\n\nPartial  Settlement  In  October  2021,  PSCo  filed  a  comprehensive settlement with the CPUC Staff and the COEO, which proposed to address four outstanding regulatory items, including recovery of fuel costs related to Winter  Storm  Uri,  disputed  revenue  associated  with  the  2020  electric decoupling pilot program year, replacement power costs associated with an extended outage at Comanche Unit 3 during 2020 and deferred customer bad  debt  balances  associated  with  COVID-19.  The  Utility  Consumer Advocate has not signed the settlement. A hearing and a CPUC decision on the settlement is expected in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Key terms of the proposed settlement:\n\n- \u00b7 PSCo would fully recover Winter Storm Uri deferred net natural gas, fuel  and  purchased  energy  costs  of  $263  million  (electric  utility)  and $287 million (natural gas utility) over a 24-month and 30-month period, respectively,  with  no  carrying  charges  through  a  rider  mechanism. Recovery would commence Jan. 1, 2022 for electric costs and April 1, 2022 for natural gas costs.\n- \u00b7 PSCo will refund electric customers $41 million (previously deferred) related to the 2020 electric decoupling pilot program.\n- \u00b7 PSCo agreed to forego recovery of $14 million for replacement power costs  due  to  an  extended  outage  at  Comanche  Unit  3  during  2020 (approved by the  CPUC in February 2022 as part of the 2020 ECA settlement agreement).\n- \u00b7 PSCo also agreed to not seek recovery of COVID-19 related bad debt expense, previously deferred as a regulatory asset, and recorded an additional $11 million of incremental bad debt expense for the period ended Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nDecoupling  Filing -PSCo's  2019  Electric  Rate  Case  included  a decoupling  program,  effective  April  1,  2020  through  Dec.  31,  2023.  The program applies to Residential and metered small C&I customers who do not pay a demand charge. The program includes a refund and surcharge cap  not  to  exceed  3%  of  forecasted  base  rate  revenue  for  a  specified period.\n\nIn April 2021, PSCo made its annual filing for 2020, and the revised tariff went into effect by operation of law on June 1, 2021. In the annual filing review, the CPUC indicated they may pursue reopening the case in order to revisit  the  cap.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2021,  PSCo  has  recognized  a  refund  for Residential customers and a surcharge for C&I customers based on 2020 and 2021 results.\n\nIn October 2021, a settlement was reached on Winter Storm Uri costs and also addressed certain components of decoupling. See Partial Settlement disclosure above for further discussion.\n\nComanche Unit 3 PSCo is part owner and operator of Comanche Unit 3, a  750  MW, coal-fueled electric generating unit. In January 2020, the unit experienced a turbine failure causing the unit to be taken offline for repairs, which were completed in June 2020. During start-up, the unit experienced a loss of turbine oil, which  damaged  the  unit.  Comanche  Unit  3 recommenced  operations  in  January  2021.  Replacement  and  repair  of damaged systems in excess of a $2 million deductible are expected to be recovered  through  insurance  policies.  PSCo  incurred  replacement  power costs of approximately $16 million during the outage.\n\nIn  October  2020,  the  CPUC  initiated  a  review  of  Comanche  Unit  3's performance. In March 2021, the CPUC Staff issued a report, which noted higher-than average outages and included criticisms of PSCo's operations of  Comanche  Unit  3  over  the  last  ten  years.  The  report  recommended thorough  explanation  of  the  future  of  Comanche  Unit  3  operations  in  the next  resource  plan,  performance  standards  for  all  company-owned generation  and  a  review  of  outage  and  repair  costs  in  upcoming  ECA proceedings.\n\n- In  October  2021,  a  comprehensive  settlement  was  reached,  which addressed treatment of 2020 Comanche Unit 3 replacement power costs. See Partial Settlement disclosure above for further discussion.",

        "page_content": "2019 Electric Rate Case Appeal - In August 2020, PSCo filed an appeal with the Denver District Court seeking a review of CPUC decisions on gains and  losses  on  sales  of  assets,  oil  and  gas  royalty  revenues,  Board  of Directors  equity  compensation  and  a  true-up  surcharge  to  collect  the difference between rates from February through August 2020 based on the CPUC's  decision  on  the  Company's  Application  for  Reconsideration, Rehearing or Reargument and rates that were actually in place. In January 2022,  the  Denver  District  Court  issued  its  decision  that  the  CPUC's approach  to  gains  and  losses  on  certain  sales  of  assets  was  legally erroneous and confiscatory to PSCo and set aside and remanded the issue for further consideration. The District Court affirmed the CPUC with respect to the remaining decisions.\n\nGCA NOPR -In  June  2021,  the  CPUC  issued  a  NOPR  addressing  the recovery of costs through the GCA. The proposed rule would establish an annual  forecast  of  GCA  costs  for  each  utility  and  allow  each  utility  to recover  only  90%-95%  of  any  costs  in  excess  of  the  forecasted  amount. The  proposed  rule  would  allow  utilities  to  earn  an  incentive  equal  to  an undefined  portion  of  any  savings  relative  to  forecasted  costs.  Comments were  filed  and  requested  that  the  CPUC  delay  the  rule  making  process until  after  the  2021  -  2022  heating  season;  in  part  because  utilities  have already proceeded with purchasing gas for the upcoming heating season in accordance with prior CPUC decisions. The CPUC has reopened the GCA NOPR matter  and  the  parties  will  submit  follow-up  comments  during  the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Purchased Power and Transmission Service Providers\n\nPSCo expects  to  meet  its  system  capacity  requirements  through  electric generating  stations,  power  purchases,  new  generation  facilities,  DSM options and expansion of generation plants.\n\nPurchased Power - PSCo purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require capacity and energy charges. It also contracts to purchase power for  both  wind  and  solar  resources.  PSCo  makes  short-term  purchases  to meet  system  load  and  energy  requirements,  replace  owned  generation, meet operating reserve obligations, or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nEnergy Markets - PSCo plans to join the SPP Western Energy Imbalance Service  Market  in  April  2023.  This  market  is  an  incremental  step  in  the participation in the organized wholesale market. Energy imbalance markets allow  participants  to  buy  and  sell  power  close  to  the  time  electricity  is consumed  and  gives  system  operators  real-time visibility across neighboring grids. The result improves balancing supply and demand at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased  Transmission  Services -  In  addition  to  using  its  own transmission  system,  PSCo  has  contracts  with  regional  transmission service providers to deliver energy to its customers.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nPSCo  conducts  various  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy related products. PSCo uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases. PSCo also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging. Sharing of any margin is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement.\n\n## SPS\n\n## Summary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\n\n| Regulatory Body / RTO                               | Additional Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PUCT                                                | Retail  electric  operations,  rates,  services,  construction  of  transmission  or  generation  and  other  aspects  of  SPS'  electric  operations.

In December 2021, the Hearing Examiner issued a recommendation that the NMPRC approve the rate case settlement agreement without modification.\n\nOn  Feb.  2,  2022,  the  NMPRC  voted  3-2  to  reject  the  uncontested stipulation  as  filed.  The  NMPRC  then  approved  a  modified  settlement, which would maintain the proposed revenue requirement increase of $62 million, but would adjust the class cost allocation such that all rate classes would have a uniform increase of 4.89%. The NMPRC required the parties to either file their acceptance or opposition to the modified settlement.",

        "page_content": "On  Feb.  9,  2022,  the  signatories  informed  the  NMPRC  they  did  not unanimously support the modifications. Accordingly, the Hearing Examiner will issue a procedural order for further proceedings on SPS' originally filed application.\n\nOn  Feb.  10,  2022,  SPS  filed  a  motion  requesting  the  NMPRC  either approve the original settlement or approve the modified settlement.\n\nOn Feb. 16, 2022, the NMPRC voted to reconsider its order and voted 3-2 to approve the stipulation without modification. New rates will go into effect on Feb. 26, 2022.\n\n2021 Texas Rate Case - In February 2021, SPS filed an electric rate case with the PUCT and its municipalities, seeking an increase in base rates of approximately  $140  million.  SPS'  proposed  net  rate  increase  to  Texas customers  was  approximately  $71  million,  or  9.2%,  as  a  result  of  the offsetting $69 million in fuel cost reductions and PTCs from the Sagamore wind project.\n\nThe request was based on a ROE of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.60%, a rate base of approximately $3.3 billion and a historic test year based on the 12-month period ended Dec. 31, 2020. The request included the effect of losing approximately 400 MW from a wholesale transmission customer and changes to depreciation lives of SPS' Tolk power plant (from 2037 to 2032) and coal handling assets at the Harrington facility (to 2024).\n\nIn  January  2022,  SPS  and  intervenors  filed  a  blackbox  settlement.  Key terms include:\n\n- \u00b7 A  base  rate  increase  of  approximately  $89  million  effective  back  to March 15, 2021.\n- \u00b7 A 9.35% ROE and 7.01% weighted average cost of capital for AFUDC purposes only.\n- \u00b7 The depreciation lives for Tolk moved up to 2034 and Harrington coal assets moved up to 2024.\n\nIn  February  2022,  the  ALJ  issued  an  order  approving  interim  rates  to  be effective on March 1, 2022. A PUCT decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Purchased Power Arrangements and Transmission Service Providers\n\nSPS expects  to  use  electric  generating  stations,  power  purchases,  DSM and new generation options to meet its system capacity requirements.\n\nPurchased Power - SPS purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term  purchased  power  contracts  typically  require  periodic  capacity and  energy  charges.  SPS  also  makes  short-term  purchases  to  meet system load and energy requirements to replace owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased  Transmission  Services -  SPS  has  contractual  arrangements with SPP and regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to its native load customers.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSPS  does  not  provide  retail  natural  gas  service,  but  purchases  and transports  natural  gas  for  its  generation  facilities  and  operates  limited natural  gas  pipeline  facilities  connecting  the  generation  facilities  to interstate  natural  gas  pipelines.  SPS  is  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the FERC with respect to natural gas transactions in interstate commerce and the PHMSA and PUCT for pipeline safety compliance.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nSPS  conducts  various  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy  related  products.  SPS  uses  physical  and  financial  instruments  to minimize  commodity  price  and  credit  risk  and  to  hedge  sales  and purchases.\n\n## Other Public Utility Matters\n\n## Comanche Unit 3 Outage\n\nIn  January 2022, PSCo experienced an incident at the Comanche Unit 3 plant  (750  MW,  coal-fueled  electric  generating  unit)  resulting  in  damage and  an  outage  that  is  expected  to  last  approximately  two  months. PSCo has notified the CPUC and informed them that it will not seek recovery of any replacement power costs above the expected costs if Comanche 3 had been in service. The estimated incremental replacement power costs could be  approximately  $10  million,  assuming  a  two  month  outage,  normal weather and current market pricing.\n\n## Marshall Wildfire\n\nIn  December  2021,  a  wildfire  ignited  in  Boulder  County,  Colorado  (the 'Marshall Fire'), which burned over 6,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over  1,000  structures.  While  there  were  no  downed  power  lines  in  the ignition area, the determination of the cause of the Marshall Fire is pending.\n\nIn  Colorado,  the  standard  of  review  governing  liability  differs  from  the 'inverse  condemnation'  or  strict  liability  standard  utilized  in  California.  In Colorado, courts look to whether electric power companies have operated their  system  with  a  heightened  duty  of  care  consistent  with  the  practical conduct of  its  business,  and  liability  does  not  extend  to  occurrences  that cannot  be  reasonably  anticipated.  In  addition,  PSCo  has  been  operating under a commission approved wildfire mitigation plan and carries wildfire liability insurance.\n\nHowever, in the unlikely event we were found liable, the damages awarded could exceed our coverage and negatively impact our results of operations, financial conditions or cash flows.\n\n## Winter Storm Uri\n\nIn  February  2021,  the  United  States  experienced  Winter  Storm  Uri. Extreme cold temperatures impacted certain operational assets as well as the availability of renewable generation. The cold weather also affected the country's supply and demand for natural gas. These factors contributed to extremely high market prices for natural gas and electricity. As a result of the extremely high market prices, Xcel Energy incurred net natural gas, fuel and purchased energy costs of approximately $1 billion (largely deferred as regulatory assets).\n\nRegulatory Overview -Xcel Energy has natural gas, fuel and purchased energy  mechanisms  in  each  jurisdiction  for  recovering  incurred  costs. However,  the  utility  subsidiaries  have  deferred  February  2021  cost increases  for  future  recovery  and  sought  recovery  of  the  cost  increases over a period of up to 63 months to mitigate the impact to customer bills. Additionally,  we  did  not  request  recovery  of  financing  costs  in  order  to further limit the impact to our customers.",

        "page_content": "## Potential Tax Reform\n\nThe  U.S.  Congress  is  currently  discussing  potential  proposals  that  may impact federal tax law. At this time, it is unknown what, if any, changes may ultimately  occur.  Based  on  provisions  passed  by  the  U.S.  House  of Representatives in November 2021, known as the Build Back Better Act, if any of such provisions were to be enacted into law, we would not expect the impact of such changes to have a material impact on our earnings.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the application  of  accounting  rules  and  guidance,  as  well  as  the  use  of estimates. Application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could  materially  impact  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  based  on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  operation  of  the  business  and results reported.\n\nAccounting policies and estimates that are most significant to Xcel Energy's results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows,  and  require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are outlined below.  Each  of  these  has  a  higher  likelihood  of  resulting  in  materially different  reported  amounts  under  different  conditions  or  using  different assumptions.  Each  critical  accounting  policy  has  been  reviewed  and discussed  with  the  Audit  Committee  of  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  Board  of Directors on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Regulatory Accounting\n\nXcel Energy is subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations , which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates  will  be  charged  and  collected.  Our  rates  are  derived  through  the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows.\n\nRegulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been  deferred  because  future  recovery  from  customers  is  probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for  future  costs.  In  other  businesses  or  industries,  regulatory  assets  and regulatory  liabilities  would  generally  be  charged  to  net  income  or  other comprehensive income.\n\nEach reporting  period  we  assess  the  probability  of  future  recoveries  and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. Factors such as the  current  regulatory  environment,  recently  issued  rate  orders  and historical  precedents  are  considered.  Decisions  made  by  regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as  the  rate  of  return  on  invested  capital,  and  may  materially  impact  our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nAt  Dec.  31,  2021,  in  assessing  the  probability  of  recovery  of  recognized regulatory  assets,  unless  otherwise  disclosed,  Xcel  Energy  noted  no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the recovery of the assets.\n\nSee  Notes  4  and  12  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further information.\n\n## Income Tax Accruals\n\nJudgment, uncertainty and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax  accrual  process  that  accounts  for  the  effects  of  current  and  deferred income  taxes.  Uncertainty  associated  with  the  application  of  tax  statutes and  regulations  and  outcomes  of  tax  audits  and  appeals  require  that judgment  and  estimates  be  made  in  the  accrual  process  and  in  the calculation of the ETR.\n\nChanges in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities  and  our  future  ETR.  ETR  calculations  are  revised  every  quarter based on best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. Tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  interim  period  reporting  guidance,  income  tax expense for  the  first  three  quarters  in  a  year  is  based  on  the  forecasted annual ETR. The forecasted ETR reflects a number of estimates, including forecasted annual income, permanent tax adjustments and tax credits.\n\nValuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that at least a portion may not be realized based on an evaluation of  expected  future  taxable  income.  Accounting  for  income  taxes  also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. We may adjust our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  and  interest  accruals  as  disputes  with  the IRS  and  state  tax  authorities  are  resolved,  and  as  new  developments occur. These adjustments may increase or decrease earnings.\n\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\nWe  sponsor  several  noncontributory,  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and other  postretirement  benefit  plans  that  cover  almost  all  employees  and certain retirees. Projected benefit costs are based on historical information and actuarial calculations that include key assumptions (annual return level on  pension  and  postretirement  health  care  investment  assets,  discount rates, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates, etc.). In addition, the pension  cost  calculation  uses  a  methodology  to  reduce  the  volatility  of investment  performance  over  time.  Pension  assumptions  are  continually reviewed.\n\nAt  Dec.  31,  2021,  Xcel  Energy  set  the  rate  of  return  on  assets  used  to measure pension costs at 6.49%, which is consistent with the rate set in 2020. The rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs is 4.10% at Dec. 31, 2021, which is consistent with the rate set in 2020.\n\nXcel  Energy's  pension  investment  strategy  is  based  on  plan-specific investments  that  seek  to  minimize  investment  and  interest  rate  risk  as  a plan's funded status increases over time. This strategy results in a greater percentage of interest rate sensitive securities being allocated to plans with higher  funded  status  ratios  and  a  greater  percentage  of  growth  assets being allocated to plans having lower funded status ratios.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2021  and  2020,  Xcel  Energy  had  regulatory  assets  of $3.8  billion  and  $3.4  billion,  respectively  and  regulatory  liabilities  of $5.7  billion  and  $5.6  billion,  respectively.  Each  subsidiary  is  subject  to regulation  that  varies  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction.  If  future  recovery  of costs in any such jurisdiction is no longer probable, Xcel Energy would be required  to  charge  these  assets  to  current  net  income  or  other comprehensive income.",

        "page_content": "Xcel Energy set the discount rates used to value the pension obligations at 3.08%  and  postretirement  health  care  obligations  at  3.09%  at  Dec.  31, 2021.  This  represents  a  37  basis  point  and  44  basis  point  decrease, respectively,  from  2020.  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  bond  matching  study  as  its primary basis for determining the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement health care obligations. The bond matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (Aa or higher) bonds that matches the expected cash flows of Xcel Energy's benefit plans in amount and duration.\n\nThe effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the discount rate for the individual plans. The bond matching study is validated for reasonableness against the Merrill Lynch Corporate 15+ Bond Index. In addition, Xcel Energy reviews general actuarial survey data to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.\n\nIf  Xcel  Energy  were  to  use  alternative  assumptions,  a  1%  change  would result in the following impact on 2021 pension costs:\n\n|                       | Pension Costs   | Pension Costs   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars) | +1%             | -1%             |\n| Rate of return        |                 | $               |\n| Discount rate  (a)    |                 | $               |\n\nMortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for pension plan and postretirement benefits. Xcel Energy's actuary conducts an experience study periodically to determine an estimate of mortality. Xcel Energy  considers  standard  mortality  tables,  improvement  factors  and  the plans actual experience when selecting a best estimate.\n\nAs of  Dec.  31,  2021,  the  initial  medical  trend  cost  claim  assumptions  for Pre-65  was  5.3%  and  Post-65  was  4.9%.  The  ultimate  trend  assumption remained at 4.5% for both Pre-65 and Post-65 claims costs. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care  market,  considering  the  levels  projected  and recommended by industry experts,  as  well  as  recent  actual  medical  cost experienced by Xcel Energy's retiree medical plan.\n\nFunding  contributions  in  2021  were  $131  million  and  are  expected  to decline in the following years. Investment returns exceeded assumed levels in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe  pension  cost  calculation  uses  a  market-related  valuation  of  pension assets.  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  calculated  value  method  to  determine  the market-related  value  of  the  plan  assets.  The  market-related  value  is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the  actual  investment  return  and  the  expected  investment  return  on  the market-related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20%  per  year.  As  differences  between  actual  and  expected  investment returns  are  incorporated  into  the  market-related  value,  amounts  are recognized in pension cost over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees (approximately 13 years in 2021).\n\nXcel  Energy  currently  projects  the  pension  costs  recognized  for  financial reporting purposes will be $77 million in 2022 and $60 million in 2023, while the  actual  pension  costs  were  $121  million  in  2021  and  $117  million  in 2020. The expected decrease in 2022 and future year costs is primarily due to the reductions in loss amortizations.\n\nPension  funding  contributions  across  all  four  of  Xcel  Energy's  pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 2019 - 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 $50 million in January 2022.\n- \u00b7 $131 million in 2021.\n- \u00b7 $150 million in 2020.\n- \u00b7 $154 million in 2019.\n\nFuture  amounts  may  change  based  on  actual  market  performance, changes  in  interest  rates  and  any  changes  in  governmental  regulations. Therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future.\n\nXcel  Energy  contributed  $15  million,  $11  million  and  $15  million  during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans. Xcel  Energy  expects  to  contribute  approximately  $9  million  during  2022. Xcel  Energy  recovers  employee  benefits  costs  in  its  utility  operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below.\n\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota  recognizes  pension  expense  in  all  regulatory jurisdictions  using  the  aggregate  normal  cost  actuarial  method. Differences  between  aggregate  normal  cost  and  expense  as calculated  by  pension  accounting  standards  are  deferred  as  a regulatory liability.\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  the  PSCW  approved  NSP-Wisconsin's  request  for  deferred accounting  treatment  of  the  2021  pension  settlement  accounting expense.  In  addition,  the  Commission  order  approved  escrow accounting treatment for pension and other post-employment benefit expenses.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory Commissions in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and FERC jurisdictions  allow  the  recovery  of  other  postretirement  benefit  costs only  to  the  extent  that  recognized  expense  is  matched  by  cash contributions  to  an  irrevocable  trust.    Xcel  Energy  has  consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions.\n- \u00b7 PSCo  and  SPS  recognize  pension  expense  in  all  regulatory jurisdictions based on GAAP. The Texas and Colorado electric retail jurisdictions  and  the  Colorado  gas  retail  jurisdiction,  each  record  the difference  between  annual  recognized  pension  expense  and  the annual amount of pension expense approved in their last respective general rate case as a deferral to a regulatory asset.\n- \u00b7 In  2018,  PSCo  was  required  to  create  a  regulatory  liability  to  adjust postretirement health care costs to zero in order to match the amounts collected in rates in the Colorado Gas retail jurisdiction. In 2020, this requirement was extended to the Colorado Electric retail jurisdiction.\n\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning\n\nXcel Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived  assets  for  which  a  legal  obligation  exists.  These  AROs  are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of  the  related  long-lived  assets.  In  the  absence  of  quoted  market  prices, Xcel  Energy  estimates  the  fair  value  of  its  AROs  using  present  value techniques,  in  which  it  makes  assumptions  including  estimates  of  the amounts  and  timing  of  future  cash  flows  associated  with  retirement activities,  credit-adjusted  risk  free  rates  and  cost  escalation  rates.  When Xcel  Energy  revises  any  assumptions,  it  adjusts  the  carrying  amount  of both  the  ARO  liability  and  related  long-lived  asset.  ARO  liabilities  are accreted to reflect the passage of time using the interest method.",

        "page_content": "A  significant  portion  of  Xcel  Energy's  AROs  relates  to  the  future decommissioning  of  NSP-Minnesota's  nuclear  facilities.  The  nuclear decommissioning  obligation  is  funded  by  the  external  decommissioning trust  fund.  Difference  between  regulatory  funding  (including  depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized is deferred as a regulatory asset. The amounts recorded for AROs related to future nuclear decommissioning were $2.1 billion in 2021 and $2.0 billion in 2020.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  obtains  periodic  independent  cost  studies  in  order  to estimate the cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities. Estimates  of  future  cash  flows  are  highly  uncertain  and  may  vary significantly from actual results. NSP-Minnesota is required to file a nuclear decommissioning filing every three years. The filing covers all expenses for the decommissioning of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material.\n\nThe currently approved triennial filing was ordered by the MPUC in January 2019.  This  approval  did  not  result  in  a  change  to  the  ARO  liability.  In December 2020, the MPUC ordered Xcel Energy to maintain the current accrual through 2021 to align with the approved one year stay out of the previously filed multi-year electric rate case. Also, in December 2020, Xcel Energy  filed  an  accrual  proposal  with  the  MPUC  to  be  effective  in  2022 based  on  an  updated  independent  cost  study.  In  December  2021,  Xcel Energy  submitted  its  petition  for  approval  of  the  2022-2024  NSPMinnesota's Nuclear Decommission Study and Assumptions. Xcel Energy anticipates the MPUC to deliberate on this filing in February 2022.\n\nThe  following  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  estimated nuclear obligation:\n\nTiming - Decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility's retirement  date  and  timing  of  the  actual  decommissioning  activities. Estimated  retirement  dates  coincide  with  the  expiration  of  each  unit's operating  license  with  the  NRC  (i.e.,  2030  for  Monticello  and  2033  and 2034  for  PI's  Unit  1  and  2,  respectively).  The  estimated  timing  of  the decommissioning activities is based upon the DECON method (required by the MPUC),  which  assumes  prompt  removal  and  dismantlement. Decommissioning activities are expected to begin at the end of the license date and be completed for both facilities by 2091.\n\nTechnology  and  Regulation -  There  is  limited  experience  with  actual decommissioning  of  large  nuclear  facilities.  Changes  in  technology, experience  and  regulations  could  cause  cost  estimates  to  change significantly.\n\nEscalation  Rates -  Escalation  rates  represent  projected  cost  increases due  to  general  inflation  and  increases  in  the  cost  of  decommissioning activities. NSP-Minnesota used an escalation rate of 3.2% in calculating the ARO  for  nuclear  decommissioning  of  its  nuclear  facilities,  based  on weighted averages of labor and non-labor escalation factors calculated by Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nDiscount Rates - Changes in timing or estimated cash flows that result in upward revisions to the ARO are calculated using the then-current creditadjusted  risk-free  interest  rate.  The  credit-adjusted  risk-free  rate  in  effect when the  change  occurs  is  used  to  discount  the  revised  estimate  of  the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity.\n\nIf  the  change  in  timing  or  estimated  expected  cash  flows  results  in  a downward  revision  of  the  ARO,  the  undiscounted  revised  estimate  of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect  at  the  date  of  initial  measurement  and  recognition  of  the  original ARO. Discount rates ranging from approximately 3% to 7% have been used to  calculate  the  net  present  value  of  the  expected  future  cash  flows  over time.\n\nSignificant  uncertainties  exist  in  estimating  future  costs  including  the method to be utilized, ultimate costs to decommission and planned method of disposing spent fuel. If different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the AROs could change materially.\n\nHowever,  changes  in  estimates  have  minimal  impact  on  results  of operations  as  NSP-Minnesota  expects  to  continue  to  recover  all  costs  in future rates.\n\nXcel Energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the assumptions and uncertainties for each area. The information and assumptions of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time. This may require adjustments to  recorded  results  to  better  reflect  updated  information  that  becomes available.  The  accompanying  financial  statements  reflect  management's best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  a  variety  of  market  risks  in  the  normal  course  of business.  Market  risk  is  the  potential  loss  that  may  occur  as  a  result  of adverse changes in the market or fair  value  of  a  particular  instrument  or commodity.  All  financial  and  commodity-related  instruments,  including derivatives, are subject to market risk.\n\nXcel  Energy  is  exposed  to  the  impact  of  adverse  changes  in  price  for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. In addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its  derivatives  and  other  contracts,  including  parental  guarantees  and requests of collateral. While we expect that the counterparties will perform under the contracts underlying its derivatives,  the  contracts  expose  us  to some credit and non-performance risk.\n\nDistress in the financial markets may impact counterparty risk, the fair value of the securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and pension fund and Xcel Energy's ability to earn a return on short-term investments.\n\nCommodity Price Risk -We are exposed to commodity price risk in our electric  and  natural  gas  operations.  Commodity  price  risk  is  managed  by entering into long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric  capacity,  energy  and  energy-related  products  and  fuels  used  in generation and distribution activities. Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our risk management policy allows us to manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation per commission approved hedge plans.",

At  Dec.  31,  2020,  a  10%  increase  in  market prices for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income from continuing  operations  by  approximately  $13  million,  whereas  a  10% decrease  would  decrease  pretax  income  from  continuing  operations  by approximately $13 million. Market price movements can exceed 10% under abnormal circumstances.\n\nThe  utility subsidiaries'  commodity  trading  operations  measure  the outstanding  risk  exposure  to  price  changes  on  contracts  and  obligations that  have  been  entered  into,  but  not  closed,  using  an  industry  standard methodology  known  as  VaR.  VaR  expresses  the  potential  change  in  fair value on the outstanding contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions.\n\nThe VaRs for the NSP-Minnesota and PSCo commodity trading operations, excluding  both  non-derivative  transactions  and  derivative  transactions designated  as  normal  purchase  and  normal  sales,  calculated  on  a consolidated basis using a Monte Carlo simulation with a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, were as follows:\n\n|   (Millions of  Dollars) | Year Ended Dec. 31   | VaR Limit   | Average   | High   | Low   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------|--------|-------|\n|                     2021 | $  1                 | $  3        | $  2      | $  52  | $  1  |\n|                     2020 | 1                    | 3           | 1         | 2      | 1     |\n\nA short-term increase in VaR occurred during the week of Feb. 12, 2021 through Feb. 18, 2021. On Feb. 17, 2021, the portfolio VaR reached a high of  $52  million.  This  increase  in  VaR  was  driven  by  the  unprecedented market conditions during Winter Storm Uri. Prior to this widespread weather event, VaR was $1 million and returned to $1 million by Feb. 19, 2021.\n\nNuclear Fuel Supply - NSP-Minnesota has contracted for approximately 78% of its 2022 enriched nuclear material requirements from sources that could be impacted by sanctions against entities doing business with Iran. Those  sanctions  may  impact  the  supply  of  enriched  nuclear  material supplied  from  Russia.  Long-term,  through  2030,  NSP-Minnesota  is scheduled  to  take  delivery  of  approximately  30%  of  its  average  enriched nuclear material requirements from these sources. NSP-Minnesota is able to  manage  nuclear  fuel  supply  with  alternate  potential  sources.  NSPMinnesota periodically assesses if further actions are required to assure a secure supply of enriched nuclear material.\n\nInterest Rate Risk - Xcel Energy is subject to interest rate risk. Our risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of  fixed  rate  debt,  floating  rate  debt  and  interest  rate  derivatives  such  as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.\n\nA 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energy's variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by approximately $11 million and $6 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nNSP-Minnesota maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the NRC. The nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. The fund is invested in a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities and other investments. These investments may be used only for the purpose of decommissioning NSPMinnesota's nuclear generating plants.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains on the decommissioning fund investments are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota's regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning  costs.  Fluctuations  in  equity  prices  or  interest  rates affecting the nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings due to the application of regulatory accounting.\n\nChanges in discount rates and expected return on plan assets impact the value of pension and postretirement plan assets and/or benefit costs.\n\nCredit Risk -Xcel Energy is also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  counterparties'  nonperformance  on  their contractual  obligations.  Xcel  Energy  maintains  credit  policies  intended  to minimize  overall  credit  risk  and  actively  monitors  these  policies  to  reflect changes and scope of operations.\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2021, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $36 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in a decrease in credit exposure of $26 million. At Dec. 31, 2020, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $11 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in an immaterial increase in credit exposure.",

        "page_content": "Xcel  Energy  conducts  credit  reviews  for  all  counterparties  and  employs credit  risk  controls,  such  as  letters  of  credit,  parental  guarantees,  master netting agreements  and  termination  provisions.  Credit  exposure  is monitored, and when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited  until  credit  enhancement  is  provided.  Distress  in  the  financial markets could increase our credit risk.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nXcel  Energy  uses  derivative  contracts  such  as  futures,  forwards,  interest rate swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity price and interest rate risk. Derivative contracts, with the exception of those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts, are reported at fair value.\n\nXcel Energy's investments held in the nuclear decommissioning fund, rabbi trusts, pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting.\n\nCommodity Derivatives - Xcel Energy monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its commodity derivative contracts and assesses each counterparty's  ability  to  perform  on  the  transactions.  The  impact  of discounting commodity derivative assets for counterparty credit risk was not material to the fair value of commodity derivative assets at Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nAdjustments to fair  value  for  credit  risk  of  commodity  trading  instruments are  recorded  in  electric  revenues.  Credit  risk  adjustments  for  other commodity  derivative  instruments  are  recorded  as  other  comprehensive income or deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities. Classification as a regulatory  asset  or  liability  is  based  on  commission  approved  regulatory recovery  mechanisms.  The  impact  of  discounting  commodity  derivative liabilities for credit risk was immaterial at Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Cash Flows\n\n## Operating Cash Flows\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                      | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cash provided by operating activities - 2020               | $  2,848                      |\n| Components of change - 2021 vs. 2020                       |                               |\n| Higher net income                                          | 124                           |\n| Non-cash transactions  (a)                                 | 52                            |\n| Changes in working capital  (b)                            | (50)                          |\n| Changes in net regulatory and other assets and liabilities | (785)                         |\n| Cash provided by operating activities - 2021               | $  2,189                      |\n\nNet  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  decreased  by  $659  million  for 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the deferral of net natural gas, fuel and purchased energy costs related to Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter.\n\n## Investing Cash Flows\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                    | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cash used in investing activities - 2020 | $  (4,740)                    |\n| Components of change - 2021 vs. 2020     |                               |\n| Decreased capital expenditures           | 1,125                         |\n| Sale of MEC in 2020                      | (684)                         |\n| Other investing activities               | 12                            |\n| Cash used in investing activities - 2021 | $  (4,287)                    |\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $453 million for 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease in capital expenditures was largely due to the purchase of MEC in January 2020, which was subsequently sold in July 2020, as well as the completion of various wind projects.\n\n## Financing Cash Flows\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                        | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cash provided by financing activities - 2020 | $  1,773                      |\n| Components of change - 2021 vs. 2020         |                               |\n| Higher debt issuances                        | 202                           |\n| Lower repayments of long-term debt           | 584                           |\n| Lower proceeds from issuance of common stock | (361)                         |\n| Higher dividends paid to shareholders        | (79)                          |\n| Other financing activities                   | 16                            |\n| Cash provided by financing activities - 2021 | $  2,135                      |\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $362 million for 2021 as  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to  the amount/timing  of  debt  issuances  and  repayments,  changes  in  capital investment  and  incremental  financing  due  to  the  lag  in  recovery  costs associated with Winter Storm Uri.\n\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Capital Requirements\n\nXcel  Energy  has  contractual  obligations  and  other  commitments  that  will need to be funded in the future. The Company expects to have adequate amounts of cash from operating and/or financing activities to meet both its short-term  and  long-term  cash  requirements.  Xcel  Energy's  financing requirements  are  dependent  on  both  existing  contractual  obligations  and other  commitments,  as  well  as  projected  capital  forecasts.  Xcel  Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing shortterm  debt,  long-term  debt,  common  stock,  hybrid  and  other  securities  to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Projected future financing requirements  can  be  impacted  by  various  factors  including  constraints  to supply chain and labor, as well as inflation.\n\nRecovery  of  the  effects  of  inflation  through  higher  customer  rates  is dependent  upon  receiving  adequate  and  timely  rate  increases.  Rate increases may not be retroactive and often lag increases in costs caused by  inflation.  On  occasion,  the  Company  may  enter  into  rate  settlement agreements, which require us to wait for a period of time to file the next base rate increase request. These agreements may result in regulatory lag whereby the impact of inflation may not yet be reflected in rates, or a delay may  occur  between  capital  project  completion  and  the  start  of  rate recovery. Xcel Energy attempts to mitigate the potential impact of inflation through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by  considering,  among  other  areas,  its  impact  on  purchases  of  energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances.",

The approval of the proposed resource plans  could  result  in  up  to  2,000  MW  of  renewable  generation  being needed  between  2024  -  2026,  resulting  in  potential  capital  expenditures estimated between $1.0 to $1.5 billion (assuming Xcel Energy were to own ~50% of the renewables). Additionally, the associated $0.5 billion to $1.0 billion  of  network  upgrades,  voltage  support  and  interconnection  work related to the Colorado Power Pathway could also be needed during this five-year  forecast  depending  on  resource  mix,  location  and  timing.  Any additional  capital  investment  would  likely  be  funded  with  approximately 50% equity and 50% debt.\n\nXcel Energy's capital expenditure forecast is subject to continuing review and modification. Actual capital expenditures may vary from estimates due to  changes  in  electric  and  natural  gas  projected  load  growth,  safety  and reliability  needs,  regulatory  decisions,  legislative  initiatives  (e.g.,  federal clean  energy  and  tax  policy),  reserve  requirements,  availability  of purchased  power,  alternative  plans  for  meeting  long-term  energy  needs, environmental  initiatives  and  regulation,  and  merger,  acquisition  and divestiture opportunities.\n\nFinancing for Capital Expenditures through 2026 - Xcel Energy issues debt and equity securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt,  fund  capital  programs,  infuse  equity  in  subsidiaries,  fund  asset acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.",

Board  of  Directors.  In  February  2022,  Xcel  Energy announced an increase in the annual dividend of 12 cents per share, which represents an increase of 6.6%.\n\nXcel Energy's dividend policy balances the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Projected cash generation.\n- \u00b7 Projected capital investment.\n- \u00b7 A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment.\n- \u00b7 The impact on Xcel Energy's capital structure and credit ratings.\n\nIn addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels.  Federal  law  places  limits  on  the  ability  of  public  utilities  within  a holding  company  to  declare  dividends.  Under  the  Federal  Power  Act,  a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The utility subsidiaries' dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture covenants.\n\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\nPension  Fund -Xcel  Energy's  pension  assets  are  invested  in  a diversified  portfolio  of  domestic  and  international  equity  securities,  shortterm to long-duration fixed income securities and alternative investments, including private equity, real estate and hedge funds.\n\nFunded status and pension assumptions:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Fair value of pension assets      | $  3,670        | $  3,599        |\n| Projected pension obligation  (a) | 3,718           | 3,964           |\n| Funded status                     | $  (48)         | $  (365)        |\n\n| Pension Assumptions               | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate                     | 3.08 % | 2.71 % |\n| Expected long-term rate of return | 6.49   | 6.49   |\n\n## Capital Sources\n\nShort-Term Funding Sources -Xcel Energy generally funds short-term needs, through operating cash flows, notes payable, commercial paper and bank  lines  of  credit.

As of Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, Xcel Energy had approximately 544 million  shares  and  537  million  shares  of  common  stock  outstanding, respectively.\n\nXcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries have registration statements on file  with  the  SEC  pursuant  to  which  they  may  sell  securities  from  time  to time.  These  registration  statements,  which  are  uncapped,  permit  Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries to issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future  offerings,  and  in  the  case  of  our  utility  subsidiaries,  subject  to commission approval.\n\nPlanned Financing Activity -Xcel Energy's 2022 financing plans reflect the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Xcel  Energy  Inc.  -  approximately  $600  million  in  unsecured  bonds during Q2.\n- \u00b7 PSCo - approximately  $650  million  of  first  mortgage  bonds  during Q2.\n- \u00b7 SPS - approximately $150 million of first mortgage bonds during Q2.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota - approximately $500 million of first mortgage bonds during Q2.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Wisconsin - approximately $100 million of first mortgage bonds during Q3.\n\nEquity through DRIP and Benefits Program -Xcel Energy also plans to issue  approximately  $90  million  of  equity  annually  through  the  DRIP  and benefit programs during the five-year forecast time period.\n\nATM  Equity  Offering -In  November  2021,  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  filed  a prospectus  supplement  under  which  it  may  sell  up  to  $800  million  of  its common stock through an ATM program.  As of Dec. 31, 2021, Xcel Energy Inc. issued 5.33 million shares of common stock with net proceeds of $347 million through the ATM program.\n\nLong-Term Borrowings and Other Financing Instruments -See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\nEarnings  Guidance  and  Long-Term  EPS  and  Dividend  Growth  Rate Objectives\n\nXcel Energy 2022 Earnings Guidance - Xcel Energy's 2022 GAAP and ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. (a)\n\nKey assumptions as compared with 2021 levels unless noted:\n\n- \u00b7 Constructive outcomes in all rate case and regulatory proceedings.\n- \u00b7 Normal weather patterns for the year.\n- \u00b7 Weather-normalized  retail  electric  sales  are  projected  to  increase ~1%.\n- \u00b7 Weather-normalized retail  firm  natural  gas  sales  are  projected  to  be 0% to 1%.\n- \u00b7 Capital rider revenue is projected to increase $35 million to $45 million (net of PTCs). PTCs are credited to customers, through capital riders and reductions to other regulatory mechanisms.\n- \u00b7 O&M expenses are projected to increase approximately 1% to 2%.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation  expense  is  projected  to  increase  approximately  $255 million to $265 million.\n- \u00b7 Property taxes are projected to increase approximately $40 million to $50 million.\n- \u00b7 Interest expense (net of AFUDC - debt) is projected to increase $55 million to $65 million.\n- \u00b7 AFUDC - equity is projected to be relatively flat.\n- \u00b7 ETR is  projected  to  be  ~(3%)  to  (5%).  The  ETR  reflects  benefits  of PTCs which are credited to customers through electric margin and will not have a material impact on net income.\n- (a) Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management's view, not reflective of ongoing operations. Ongoing  earnings  could  differ  from  those  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  for unplanned  and/or  unknown  adjustments.  Xcel  Energy  is  unable  to  forecast  if  any  of these items will occur or provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing EPS to corresponding GAAP EPS.\n\nLong-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives -Xcel Energy expects to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, based on the following long-term objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of 5% to 7% based off of a 2021 base of $2.96 per share, which represents the mid-point of the revised 2021 guidance range of $2.94 to $2.98 per share.\n- \u00b7 Deliver annual dividend increases of 5% to 7%.\n- \u00b7 Target a dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%.\n- \u00b7 Maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range.\n\n## ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nSee the 'Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk' section in Item 7, incorporated by reference.\n\n## ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nSee Item 15-1 for an index of financial statements included herein.\n\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.",

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Xcel Energy Inc.\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these financial  statements,  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  and  for  its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  to  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements.  Our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  Our  audits  also  included  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 4 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce, (collectively with state utility regulatory agencies, the 'Commissions'). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  prepare  its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including property, plant and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and expenses, and income taxes.\n\nThe Company is subject to regulatory rate setting processes. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in assets required to deliver services to customers. Accounting for the Company's regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. In the  rate  setting  process,  the  Company's  rates  result  in  the  recording  of  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  based  on  the  probability  of  future  cash  flows. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, and 3) a refund due to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of  future  decisions  by  the  Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the recognition of regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n- \u00b7 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural schedules and memorandums, filings made by intervenors, experts' testimony and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We also  evaluated  regulatory  filings  for  any  evidence  that  intervenors  are  challenging  full  recovery  of  the  cost  of  any  capital  projects.  If  the  full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management's assessment of the probability of a disallowance. We evaluated the external information and compared to the Company's recorded regulatory assets and liabilities for completeness.\n- \u00b7 We  obtained  management's  analysis  and  correspondence  from  counsel,  as  appropriate,  regarding  regulatory  assets  or  liabilities  not  yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n\n## /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFebruary 23, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

        "page_content": "## XCEL ENERGY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nGeneral -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  utility  subsidiaries  are  engaged  in  the regulated  generation,  purchase,  transmission,  distribution  and  sale  of electricity  and  in  the  regulated  purchase,  transportation,  distribution  and sale of natural gas.\n\nXcel Energy's regulated operations include the activities of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin,  PSCo  and  SPS.  These  utility  subsidiaries  serve  electric and natural  gas  customers  in  portions  of  Colorado,  Michigan,  Minnesota, New  Mexico,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Texas  and  Wisconsin.  Also included in regulated operations are WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, and WYCO, a joint venture with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities.\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  nonregulated  subsidiaries  include  Eloigne,  Capital Services, Venture Holdings and Nicollet Project Holdings. Eloigne invests in rental  housing  projects  that  qualify  for  low-income  housing  tax  credits. Capital  Services  procures  equipment  for  construction  of  renewable generation  facilities  at  other  subsidiaries.  Venture  Holdings  invests  in limited  partnerships,  including  EIP  funds  with  portfolios  of  investments  in energy  technology  companies.  Nicollet  Project  Holdings  invests  in nonregulated  assets  such  as  the  MEC  generating  facility  (through  July 2020) and Minnesota community solar gardens. Xcel Energy Inc. owns the following  additional  direct  subsidiaries,  some  of  which  are  intermediate holding  companies  with  additional  subsidiaries:  Xcel  Energy  Wholesale Group Inc., Xcel Energy Markets Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy Ventures Inc., Xcel Energy Retail Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy Communications Group, Inc., Xcel  Energy  International  Inc.,  Xcel  Energy  Transmission  Holding Company,  LLC,  Nicollet  Holdings  Company,  LLC,  Xcel  Energy  Nuclear Services  Holdings,  LLC  and  Xcel  Energy  Services  Inc.  Xcel  Energy  Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.\n\nXcel  Energy's  consolidated  financial  statements  include  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries  and  VIEs  for  which  it  is  the  primary  beneficiary.  All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated unless a different treatment is appropriate for rate regulated transactions. Xcel Energy uses the  equity  method  of  accounting  for  its  investments  in  EIP  funds  and WYCO.\n\nXcel  Energy  has  investments  in  certain  plants  and  transmission  facilities jointly  owned with nonaffiliated utilities. Xcel Energy's proportionate share of jointly owned facilities is recorded as property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets, and Xcel Energy's proportionate share of the  operating  costs  associated  with  these  facilities  is  included  in  its consolidated statements of income.\n\nXcel Energy's  consolidated  financial statements  are  presented  in accordance with GAAP. All of the utility subsidiaries' underlying accounting records  also  conform  to  the  FERC  uniform  system  of  accounts.  Certain amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or  notes  have  been reclassified  for  comparative  purposes;  however, such reclassifications did not affect net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows.\n\nXcel Energy has evaluated events occurring after Dec. 31, 2021 up to the date  of  issuance  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements.  These statements  contain  all  necessary  adjustments  and  disclosures  resulting from that evaluation.\n\nUse  of  Estimates -  Xcel  Energy  uses  estimates  based  on  the  best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations.\n\nEstimates are used for items such as plant depreciable lives or  potential disallowances,  AROs,  certain  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities,  tax provisions, uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues, jurisdictional  fuel  and  energy  cost  allocations  and  actuarially  determined benefit  costs.  Recorded  estimates  are  revised  when  better  information becomes  available  or  actual  amounts  can  be  determined.  Revisions  can affect operating results.\n\nRegulatory Accounting - Xcel Energy Inc.'s regulated utility subsidiaries account  for  income  and  expense  items  in  accordance  with  accounting guidance for regulated operations. Under this guidance:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain costs, which would otherwise be charged to expense or other comprehensive  income,  are  deferred  as  regulatory  assets  based  on the expected ability to recover the costs in future rates.\n- \u00b7 Certain credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income or other comprehensive income, are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on the  expectation  the  amounts  will  be  returned  to  customers  in  future rates,  or  because  the  amounts  were  collected  in  rates  prior  to  the costs being incurred.\n\nEstimates of recovering deferred costs and returning deferred credits are based  on  specific  ratemaking  decisions  or  precedent  for  each  item. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment in the rate setting process.\n\nIf changes in the regulatory environment occur, the utility subsidiaries may no  longer  be  eligible  to  apply  this  accounting  treatment  and  may  be required  to  eliminate  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  from  their  balance sheets. Such changes could have a material effect on Xcel Energy's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information.\n\nIncome Taxes - Xcel Energy accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  for  the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have been included in the financial statements. Xcel Energy defers income taxes for  all  temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable income and between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.\n\nXcel  Energy  uses  rates  that  are  scheduled  to  be  in  effect  when  the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe  effects  of  tax  rate  changes  that  are  attributable  to  the  utility subsidiaries are generally subject to a normalization method of accounting. Therefore,  the  revaluation  of  most  of  the  utility  subsidiaries'  net  deferred taxes  upon  a  tax  rate  reduction  results  in  the  establishment  of  a  net regulatory liability, which would be refundable to utility customers over the remaining life of the related assets. Xcel Energy anticipates that a tax rate increase would result in the establishment of a regulatory asset, subject to an evaluation of whether future recovery is expected.",

        "page_content": "Reversal  of  certain  temporary  differences  are  accounted  for  as  current income tax expense due to the effects of past regulatory practices  when deferred  taxes  were  not  required  to  be  recorded  due  to  the  use  of  flow through  accounting  for  ratemaking  purposes.  Tax  credits  are  recorded when  earned  unless  there  is  a  requirement  to  defer  the  benefit  and amortize  it  over  the  book  depreciable  lives  of  the  related  property.  The requirement to defer and amortize tax credits only applies to federal ITCs related to public utility property. Utility rate regulation also has resulted in the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities related to income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than  not  that  some  portion  or  all  of  the  deferred  tax  asset  will  not  be realized.\n\nXcel  Energy  follows  the  applicable  accounting  guidance  to  measure  and disclose uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take in its income  tax  returns.  Xcel  Energy  recognizes  a  tax  position  in  its consolidated  financial  statements  when  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of  the  position.  Recognition  of  changes  in  uncertain  tax  positions  are reflected as a component of income tax expense.\n\nXcel Energy reports interest and penalties related to income taxes within other (expense) income or interest charges in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  file  consolidated  federal  income  tax returns  as  well  as  consolidated  or  separate  state  income  tax  returns. Federal  income  taxes  paid  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  are  allocated  to  its subsidiaries based on separate company computations. A similar allocation is made for state income taxes paid by Xcel Energy Inc. in connection with consolidated  state  filings.  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  also  allocates  its  own  income tax benefits to its direct subsidiaries.\n\nSee Note 7 for further information.\n\nProperty,  Plant  and  Equipment  and  Depreciation  in  Regulated Operations - Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost. The cost of plant includes direct labor and materials, contracted work, overhead costs  and  AFUDC.  The  cost  of  plant  retired  is  charged  to  accumulated depreciation  and  amortization.  Amounts  recovered  in  rates  for  future removal costs are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Significant additions or improvements  extending  asset  lives  are  capitalized,  while  repairs  and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Maintenance and replacement  of  items  determined  to  be  less  than  a  unit  of  property  are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Planned maintenance activities are  charged  to  operating  expense  unless  the  cost  represents  the acquisition  of  an  additional  unit  of  property  or  the  replacement  of  an existing unit of property.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  is  tested  for  impairment  when  it  is determined that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. A loss is recognized in the current period if it becomes probable that part of a cost  of  a  plant  under  construction  or  recently  completed  plant  will  be disallowed for recovery from customers and a reasonable estimate of the disallowance  can  be  made.  For  investments  in  property,  plant  and equipment  that  are  abandoned  and  not  expected  to  go  into  service, incurred  costs  and  related  deferred  tax  amounts  are  compared  to  the discounted  estimated  future  rate  recovery,  and  a  loss  is  recognized,  if necessary.\n\nXcel  Energy  records  depreciation  expense  using  the  straight-line  method over the plant's commission approved useful life. Actuarial life studies are performed and submitted to the state and federal commissions for review. Upon acceptance by the various commissions, the resulting lives and net salvage  rates  are  used  to  calculate  depreciation.  Plant  removal  costs  of Xcel  Energy's  utility  subsidiaries  are  recovered  in  rates  as  authorized  by the appropriate regulatory entities. The amount of removal costs is based on current factors used in existing depreciation rates. Accumulated removal costs  are  reflected  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  a  regulatory liability.  Depreciation  expense,  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  average depreciable property, was approximately 3.5% for 2021, 3.4% for 2020 and 3.3% for 2019.\n\nSee Note 3 for further information.\n\nAROs -Xcel Energy accounts for AROs under accounting guidance that requires  a  liability  for  the  fair  value  of  an  ARO  to  be  recognized  in  the period  in  which  it  is  incurred  if  it  can  be  reasonably  estimated,  with  the offsetting  associated  asset  retirement  costs  capitalized  as  a  long-lived asset. The liability is generally increased over time by applying the effective interest method of accretion, and the capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset. Changes resulting from revisions to the  timing  or  amount  of  expected  asset  retirement  cash  flows  are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO.\n\nSee Note 12 for further information.\n\nNuclear  Decommissioning -  Nuclear  decommissioning  studies  that estimate  NSP-Minnesota's  costs  of  decommissioning  its  nuclear  power plants are performed at least every three years and submitted to the state commissions for approval.\n\nNSP-Minnesota recovers regulator-approved decommissioning costs of its nuclear  power  plants  over  each  facility's  expected  service  life,  typically based  on  the  triennial  decommissioning  studies.  The  studies  consider estimated  future  costs  of  decommissioning  and  the  market  value  of investments  in  trust  funds  and  recommend  annual  funding  amounts. Amounts collected in  rates  are  deposited  in  the  trust  funds.  For  financial reporting purposes, NSP-Minnesota accounts for nuclear decommissioning as an ARO.\n\nRestricted funds for the payment of future decommissioning expenditures for NSP-Minnesota's nuclear facilities are included in nuclear decommissioning  fund  and  other  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 12 for further information.\n\nBenefit  Plans  and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits -  Xcel  Energy maintains pension and postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees. Recognizing  the  cost  of  providing  benefits  and  measuring  the  projected benefit  obligation  of  these  plans  requires  management  to  make  various assumptions and estimates.\n\nCertain  unrecognized  actuarial  gains  and  losses  and  unrecognized  prior service  costs  or  credits  are  deferred  as  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities, rather than recorded as other comprehensive income, based on regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nSee Note 11 for further information.",

        "page_content": "Environmental  Costs -  Environmental  costs  are  recorded  when  it  is probable Xcel Energy is liable for remediation costs and the liability can be reasonably  estimated.  Costs  are  deferred  as  a  regulatory  asset  if  it  is probable  that  the  costs  will  be  recovered  from  customers  in  future  rates. Otherwise, the costs are expensed. For certain environmental costs related to  facilities  currently  in  use,  such  as  for  emission-control  equipment,  the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the plant.\n\nEstimated  remediation  costs  are  regularly  adjusted  as  estimates  are revised  and  remediation  proceeds.  If  other  participating  potentially responsible parties exist and acknowledge their potential involvement with a site,  costs  are  estimated and recorded only for Xcel Energy's expected share of the cost.\n\nFuture  costs  of  restoring  sites  are  treated  as  a  capitalized  cost  of  plant retirement. The depreciation expense levels recoverable in rates include a provision for removal expenses. Removal costs recovered in rates before the related costs are incurred are classified as a regulatory liability.\n\nSee Note 12 for further information.\n\nRevenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers -  Performance  obligations related  to  the  sale  of  energy  are  satisfied  as  energy  is  delivered  to customers. Xcel Energy recognizes revenue that corresponds to the price of the energy delivered to the customer. The measurement of energy sales to  customers  is  generally  based  on  the  reading  of  their  meters,  which occurs  systematically  throughout  the  month.  At  the  end  of  each  month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading  are  estimated,  and  the  corresponding  unbilled  revenue  is recognized.\n\nXcel  Energy  does  not  recognize  a  separate  financing  component  of  its collections from customers as contract terms are short-term in nature. Xcel Energy presents its revenues net of any excise or sales taxes or fees. The utility  subsidiaries  recognize physical sales to customers (native load and wholesale)  on  a  gross  basis  in  electric  revenues  and  cost  of  sales. Revenues and charges for short-term physical wholesale sales of excess energy transacted through RTOs are also recorded on a gross basis. Other revenues and charges settled/facilitated through an RTO are recorded on a net basis in cost of sales.\n\nSee Note 6 for further information.\n\nCash  and  Cash  Equivalents -  Xcel  Energy  considers  investments  in instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\nAccounts  Receivable  and  Allowance  for  Bad  Debts -  Accounts receivable  are  stated  at  the  actual  billed  amount  net  of  an  allowance  for bad  debts.  Xcel  Energy  establishes  an  allowance  for  uncollectible receivables  based  on  a  policy  that  reflects  its  expected  exposure  to  the credit risk of customers.\n\nAs  of    Dec.  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  allowance  for  bad  debts  was  $106 million and $79 million, respectively.\n\nInventory - Inventory is  recorded  at  average  cost  and  consisted  of  the following:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)   | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Inventories             |                 |                 |\n| Materials and supplies  | $  289          | $  275          |\n| Fuel                    | 182             | 176             |\n| Natural gas             | 160             | 84              |\n| Total inventories       | $  631          | $  535          |\n\nEquity Method Investments -The equity method of accounting is used for  investments  in  WYCO  and  EIP  funds,  which  results  in  Xcel  Energy's recognition of its share of these investees' GAAP pretax earnings, based on  Xcel  Energy's  proportional  ownership  interest.  For  investments  in  EIP funds,  this  includes  Xcel  Energy's  share  of  fund  expenses  and  realized gains  and  losses,  as  well  as  unrealized  gains  and  losses  resulting  from valuations  of  the  funds'  investments  in  emerging  energy  technology companies.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements -  Xcel  Energy  presents  cash  equivalents, interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives and nuclear decommissioning  fund  assets  at  estimated  fair  values  in  its  consolidated financial statements.\n\nCash equivalents are recorded at cost plus accrued interest; money market funds  are  measured  using  quoted  NAVs.  For  interest  rate  derivatives, quoted prices based primarily on observable market interest rate curves are used  to  establish  fair  value.  For  commodity  derivatives,  the  most observable inputs available are generally used to determine the fair value of each contract. In the absence of a quoted price, Xcel Energy may use quoted prices for similar contracts or internally prepared valuation models to determine fair value.\n\nFor the pension and postretirement plan assets and nuclear decommissioning  fund,  published  trading  data  and  pricing  models, generally  using  the  most  observable  inputs  available,  are  utilized  to estimate fair value for each security.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 11 for further information.\n\nDerivative  Instruments -  Xcel  Energy  uses  derivative  instruments  in connection  with  its  interest  rate,  utility  commodity  price  and  commodity trading  activities,  including  forward  contracts,  futures,  swaps  and  options. Any  derivative  instruments  not  qualifying  for  the  normal  purchases  and normal sales exception are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as derivative instruments. Classification of changes in fair value for  those  derivative  instruments  is  dependent  on  the  designation  of  a qualifying  hedging  relationship.  Changes  in  fair  value  of  derivative instruments not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are reflected in  current earnings or as a regulatory asset or liability. Classification as a regulatory  asset  or  liability  is  based  on  commission  approved  regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nGains  or  losses  on  commodity  trading  transactions  are  recorded  as  a component  of  electric  operating  revenues  and  interest  rate  hedging transactions are recorded as a component of interest expense.\n\nNormal  Purchases  and  Normal  Sales -  Xcel  Energy  enters  into contracts for purchases and sales of commodities for use in its operations. At  inception,  contracts  are  evaluated  to  determine  whether  a  derivative exists  and/or  whether  an  instrument  may  be  exempted  from  derivative accounting if designated as a normal purchase or normal sale.\n\nSee Note 10 for further information.\n\nCommodity  Trading  Operations -  All  applicable  gains  and  losses related to commodity trading activities are shown on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nCommodity trading activities are not associated with energy produced from Xcel Energy's generation assets or energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading contracts are recorded at fair market value and  commodity  trading  results  include  the  impact  of  all  margin-sharing mechanisms.\n\nSee Note 10 for further information.",

        "page_content": "## Other Utility Items\n\nAFUDC -AFUDC  represents  the  cost  of  capital  used  to  finance  utility construction  activity.  AFUDC  is  computed  by  applying  a  composite financing  rate  to  qualified  CWIP.  The  amount  of  AFUDC  capitalized  as  a utility construction cost is credited to other nonoperating income (for equity capital) and interest charges (for debt capital). AFUDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel Energy's rate base for establishing utility rates.\n\nAlternative  Revenue -  Certain  rate  rider  mechanisms  (including decoupling/sales  true  up  and  CIP/DSM  programs)  qualify  as  alternative revenue programs. These mechanisms arise from costs imposed upon the utility by  action  of  a  regulator  or  legislative  body  related  to  an environmental,  public  safety  or  other  mandate  or  from  other  instances where  the  regulator  authorizes  a  future  surcharge  in  response  to  past activities  or  completed  events.  When  certain  criteria  are  met,  including expected collection within 24 months, revenue is recognized equal to the revenue requirement, which may include incentives and return on rate base items. Billing amounts are revised periodically for differences between total amount collected and revenue earned, which may increase or decrease the level  of  revenue  collected  from  customers.  Alternative  revenues  arising from  these  programs  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis  and  disclosed separately from revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nSee Note 6 for further information.\n\nConservation Programs -Costs incurred for DSM and CIP programs are deferred  if  it  is  probable  future  revenue  will  recover  the  incurred  cost. Revenues  recognized  for  incentive  programs  for  the  recovery  of  lost margins and/or conservation performance incentives are limited to amounts expected to be collected within 24 months from the year they are earned. Regulatory assets are recognized to reflect the amount of costs or earned incentives that have not yet been collected from customers.\n\nEmission  Allowances -Emission  allowances  are  recorded  at  cost, including  broker  commission  fees.  The  inventory  accounting  model  is utilized  for  all  emission  allowances  and  sales  of  these  allowances  are included in electric revenues.\n\nNuclear  Refueling  Outage  Costs -  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  deferral  and amortization  method  for  nuclear  refueling  costs.  This  method  amortizes costs  over  the  period  between  refueling  outages  consistent  with  rate recovery.\n\nRECs -Cost  of  RECs  that  are  utilized  for  compliance  is  recorded  as electric  fuel  and  purchased  power  expense.  In  certain  jurisdictions,  Xcel Energy reduces recoverable fuel and purchased power costs for the cost of RECs  received.  An  inventory  accounting  model  is  used  to  account  for RECs  recognized  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets,  however  these assets  are  classified  as  regulatory  assets  if  amounts  are  recoverable  in future rates.\n\nSales of RECs are recorded in electric revenues on a gross basis. The cost of  these  RECs  and  amounts  credited  to  customers  under  margin-sharing mechanisms are recorded in electric fuel and purchased power expense.\n\nCost of RECs that are utilized to support commodity trading activities are recorded in a similar manner as the associated commodities and are shown on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## 2.   Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Recently Adopted\n\nCredit Losses -In 2016, the FASB issued Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 326 (ASC Topic 326), which changes how entities account for losses on receivables and certain other assets. The guidance requires use  of  a  current  expected  credit  loss  model,  which  may  result  in  earlier recognition of credit losses than under previous accounting standards.\n\nXcel  Energy  implemented  the  guidance  using  a  modified-retrospective approach, recognizing a cumulative effect charge of $2 million (after tax) to retained earnings on Jan. 1, 2020. Other than first-time recognition of an allowance for bad debts on accrued unbilled revenues, the Jan. 1, 2020, adoption  of  ASC  Topic  326  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  Xcel Energy's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3.

In addition,  the  unrecognized  tax  benefit  balance  includes  temporary  tax positions  for  which  deductibility  is  highly  certain,  but  for  which  there  is uncertainty about the timing. A change in the period of deductibility would not affect the ETR but would accelerate the payment to the taxing authority.\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits - permanent vs. temporary:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                              | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Unrecognized tax benefit - Permanent tax positions | $  47           | $  41           |\n| Unrecognized tax benefit - Temporary tax positions | 11              | 11              |\n| Total unrecognized tax benefit                     | $  58           | $  52           |\n\nChanges in unrecognized tax benefits:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                         | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Balance at Jan. 1                                             | $  52  | $  44  | $  37  |\n| Additions based on tax positions related to the current year  | 5      | 9      | 10     |\n| Reductions based on tax positions related to the current year | -      | (2)    | (4)    |\n| Additions for tax positions of prior years                    | 2      | 35     | 1      |\n| Reductions for tax positions of prior years                   | (1)    | (34)   | -      |\n| Balance at Dec. 31                                            | $  58  | $  52  | $  44  |\n\nUnrecognized  tax  benefits  were  reduced  by  tax  benefits  associated  with NOL and tax credit carryforwards:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)            | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| NOL and tax credit carryforwards | $  (36)         | (31)            |\n\nAs the IRS progresses its review of the tax loss carryback claims and as state  audits  progress,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  amount  of unrecognized tax benefit could decrease up to approximately $28 million in the next 12 months.\n\nPayable for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is partially offset by the interest benefit associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards.\n\nInterest payable related to unrecognized tax benefits:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                 | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Payable for interest related to unrecognized  tax benefits at Jan. 1  | $  (3) | $  -   | $  -   |\n| Interest expense related to unrecognized tax  benefits                | -      | (3)    | -      |\n| Payable for interest related to unrecognized  tax benefits at Dec. 31 | $  (3) | $  (3) | $  -   |\n\nNo penalties were accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as of Dec. 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\nOther Income Tax Matters - NOL amounts represent the tax loss that is carried forward and tax credits represent the deferred tax asset.

The  liability  awards  have  been  historically dependent  on  relative  TSR  measured  over  a  three-year  period.  Xcel Energy Inc.'s TSR is compared to a peer group of other utility companies. Potential payouts of the awards range from zero to 200%.\n\nTSR liability awards granted:\n\n| (In Thousands)   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Awards granted   |    221 |    212 |    225 |\n\n## TSR liability awards settled:\n\n(Units In Thousands, Settlement\n\n| Amount in Millions)                                          | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Awards settled                                               | 446    | 476    | 466    |\n| Settlement amount (cash, common stock  and deferred amounts) | $  27  | $  33  | $  25  |\n\nTSR liability awards of $22 million were settled in cash in 2021.\n\nShare-Based Compensation Expense - Other than for restricted stock, vesting  of  employee  equity  awards  is  typically  predicated  on  the achievement  of  a  TSR  or  environmental  measures  target.  Additionally, approximately 0.2 million, 0.2 million, and 0.3 million of equity award units were granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, with vesting subject only to service conditions of three years.\n\nGenerally,  these  instruments  are  considered  to  be  equity  awards  as  the award settlement determination (shares or cash) is made by Xcel Energy, not  the  participants.  In  addition,  these  awards  have  not  been  previously settled  in  cash  and  Xcel  Energy  plans  to  continue  electing  share settlement.\n\nGrant date fair value of equity awards is expensed over the service period. TSR liability awards have been historically settled partially in cash, and do not qualify as equity awards, but rather are accounted for as liabilities. As liability  awards,  the  fair  value  on  which  ratable  expense  is  based,  as employees vest in their rights to those awards, is remeasured each period based on the current stock price and performance achievement, and final expense is based on the market value of the shares on the date the award is settled.\n\nCompensation costs related to share-based awards:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                         | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Compensation cost for share-based awards  (a) | $  31  | $  73  | $  58  |\n| Tax benefit recognized in income              | 8      | 19     | 15     |\n\nThere  was  approximately  $28  million  in  2021  and  $51  million  in  2020  of total  unrecognized  compensation  cost  related  to  nonvested  share-based compensation awards. Xcel Energy expects to recognize the unrecognized amount over a weighted average period of 1.6 years.\n\n## 9.   Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic  EPS  was  computed  by  dividing  the  earnings  available  to  common shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares outstanding. Diluted EPS was computed by dividing the earnings available to  common  shareholders  by  the  diluted  weighted  average  number  of common shares outstanding.\n\nDiluted  EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if  securities  or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled.  The  weighted  average  number  of  potentially  dilutive  shares outstanding used to calculate diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method.\n\nCommon  Stock  Equivalents -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  has  common  stock equivalents related to forward equity agreements and certain equity awards in  share-based  compensation  arrangements.  Common  stock  equivalents include commitments to issue common stock related to time-based equity compensation awards.\n\nStock  equivalent  units  granted  to  Xcel  Energy's  Board  of  Directors  are included  in  common  shares  outstanding  upon  grant  date  as  there  is  no further  service,  performance  or  market  condition  associated  with  these. Restricted stock issued to employees under the Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan is included in common shares outstanding when granted.\n\nShare-based  compensation  arrangements  for  which  there  is  currently  no dilutive impact to EPS include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Equity  awards  subject  to  a  performance  condition;  included  in common  shares  outstanding  when  all  necessary  conditions  for settlement have been satisfied by the end of the reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Liability  awards  subject  to  a  performance  condition;  any  portions settled  in  shares  are  included  in  common  shares  outstanding  upon settlement.\n\nCommon  shares  outstanding  used  in  the  basic  and  diluted  EPS computation:\n\n| (Shares in Millions)   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Basic                  |    539 |    527 |    519 |\n| Diluted  (a)           |    540 |    528 |    520 |",

        "page_content": "## Fair Value Measurements\n\nAccounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures provides a single definition of fair value and requires disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. A hierarchical framework for disclosing the observability of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value is established by this guidance.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 -Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities  included  in  Level  1  are  highly  liquid  and  actively  traded instruments with quoted prices.\n- \u00b7 Level  2 -Pricing  inputs  are  other  than  quoted  prices  in  active markets  but  are  either  directly  or  indirectly  observable  as  of  the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are  typically  either  comparable  to  actively  traded  securities  or contracts or priced with models using highly observable inputs.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 -Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of  the  reporting  date.  The  types  of  assets  and  liabilities  included  in Level 3 are those valued with models  requiring significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nSpecific valuation methods include:\n\nCash  equivalents -The  fair  values  of  cash  equivalents  are  generally based  on  cost  plus  accrued  interest;  money  market  funds  are  measured using quoted NAV.\n\nInvestments  in  equity  securities  and  other  funds -Equity  securities are  valued  using  quoted  prices  in  active  markets.  The  fair  values  for commingled  funds  are  measured  using  NAVs.  The  investments  in commingled funds may be redeemed for NAV with proper notice. Private equity  commingled fund investments require approval of the fund for any unscheduled  redemption,  and  such  redemptions  may  be  approved  or denied  by  the  fund  at  its  sole  discretion.  Unscheduled  distributions  from real  estate  commingled  fund  investments  may  be  redeemed  with  proper notice, however, withdrawals may be delayed or discounted as a result of fund illiquidity.\n\nInvestments  in  debt  securities -Fair  values  for  debt  securities  are determined  by  a  third-party  pricing  service  using  recent  trades  and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities.\n\nInterest  rate  derivatives -Fair  values  of  interest  rate  derivatives  are based on broker quotes that utilize current market interest rate forecasts.\n\nCommodity  derivatives -Methods  used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of commodity  derivative  forwards  and  options  utilize  forward  prices  and volatilities, as well as pricing adjustments for specific delivery locations, and are  generally  assigned  a  Level  2  classification.  When  contractual settlements relate to inactive delivery locations or extend to periods beyond those  readily  observable  on  active  exchanges  or  quoted  by  brokers,  the significance of the use of less observable forecasts of forward prices and volatilities  on  a  valuation  is  evaluated  and  may  result  in  Level  3 classification.\n\nElectric  commodity  derivatives  held  by  NSP-Minnesota  and  SPS  include transmission congestion instruments, generally referred to as FTRs. FTRs purchased from an RTO are financial instruments that entitle or obligate the holder to monthly revenues or charges based on transmission congestion across a given transmission path.\n\nThe value of an FTR is derived from, and designed to offset, the cost of transmission  congestion.  If  forecasted  costs  of  electric  transmission congestion  increase  or  decrease  for  a  given  FTR  path,  the  value  of  that particular  FTR  instrument  will  likewise  increase  or  decrease.  Given  the limited observability of certain inputs to the value of FTRs between auction processes,  including  expected  plant  operating  schedules  and  retail  and wholesale demand, fair value measurements for FTRs have been assigned a Level 3.\n\nNon-trading monthly FTR settlements are included in fuel and purchased energy  cost  recovery  mechanisms  as  applicable  in  each  jurisdiction,  and therefore changes in the fair value of the yet to be settled portions of most FTRs are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. Given this regulatory treatment and the limited magnitude of FTRs relative to the electric utility operations  of  NSP-Minnesota  and  SPS,  the  numerous  unobservable quantitative  inputs  pertinent  to  the  value  of  FTRs  are  immaterial  to  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning Fund\n\nThe NRC requires NSP-Minnesota to maintain a portfolio of investments to fund the costs of decommissioning its nuclear generating plants. Assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund are legally restricted for the purpose of decommissioning these facilities. The fund contains cash equivalents, debt securities,  equity  securities  and  other  investments.  NSP-Minnesota  uses the  MPUC  approved  asset  allocation  for  the  investment  targets  by  asset class for the qualified trust.\n\nNSP-Minnesota recognizes the costs of funding the decommissioning over the lives of the nuclear plants, assuming rate recovery of all costs. Realized and  unrealized  gains  on  fund  investments  over  the  life  of  the  fund  are deferred  as  an  offset  of  NSP-Minnesota's  regulatory  asset  for  nuclear decommissioning costs. Consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset.\n\nUnrealized  gains  for  the  nuclear  decommissioning  fund  were  $1.3  billion and  $981  million  as  of  Dec.  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  and unrealized losses were $7 million and $5 million as of Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nNon-derivative instruments with recurring fair value measurements:\n\n|                                   | Dec. 31, 2021                     | Dec. 31, 2021                     | Dec. 31, 2021                     | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                   |                                   | Fair Value                        | Fair Value                        | Fair Value      | Fair Value      | Fair Value      |\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | Cost                              | Level 1                           | Level 2                           | Level 3         | NAV             | Total           |\n| Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) |                 |                 |                 |\n| Cash equivalents                  | $  64                             | $  64                             | $  -                              | $  -            | $  -            | $  64           |\n| Commingled funds                  | 856                               | -                                 | -                                 | -               | 1,294           | 1,294           |\n| Debt securities                   | 631                               | -                                 | 666                               | 9               | -               | 675             |\n| Equity securities                 | 411                               | 1,222                             | 1                                 | -               | -               | 1,223           |\n| Total                             | $  1,962                          | $  1,286                          | $  667                            | $  9            | $  1,294        | $  3,256        |",

These  derivative instruments are generally designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, with changes in fair value prior to settlement recorded as other comprehensive income.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2021,  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  related  to settled interest rate derivatives included $5 million of net losses expected to be  reclassified  into  earnings  during  the  next  12  months  as  the  hedged transactions  impact  earnings.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2021,  Xcel  Energy  had  no unsettled interest rate derivatives.\n\nWholesale  and  Commodity  Trading  Risk -Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  utility subsidiaries  conduct  various  wholesale  and  commodity  trading  activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. Xcel Energy  is  allowed  to  conduct  these  activities  within  guidelines  and limitations  as  approved  by  its  risk  management  committee,  comprised  of management personnel not directly involved in activities governed by this policy.\n\nCommodity Derivatives -Xcel Energy enters into derivative instruments to  manage  variability  of  future  cash  flows  from  changes  in  commodity prices  in  its  electric  and  natural  gas  operations,  as  well  as  for  trading purposes.  This  could  include  the  purchase  or  sale  of  energy  or  energyrelated  products,  natural  gas  to  generate  electric  energy,  natural  gas  for resale, FTRs, vehicle fuel and weather derivatives.\n\nXcel Energy may enter into derivative instruments that mitigate commodity price risk on behalf of electric and natural gas customers but may not be designated  as  qualifying  hedging  transactions.  The  classification  of unrealized  losses  or  gains  on  these  instruments  as  a  regulatory  asset  or liability, if applicable, is based  on  approved  regulatory  recovery mechanisms.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2021, Xcel Energy had no commodity contracts designated as cash flow hedges.\n\nXcel  Energy  enters  into  commodity  derivative  instruments  for  trading purposes  not  directly  related  to  commodity  price  risks  associated  with serving its electric and natural gas customers. Changes in the fair value of these  commodity  derivatives  are  recorded  in  electric  operating  revenues, net of amounts credited to customers under margin-sharing mechanisms.\n\nGross notional amounts of commodity forwards, options and FTRs:\n\n| (Amounts in Millions)  (a)(b)   |   Dec. 31, 2021 |   Dec. 31, 2020 |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| MWh of electricity              |              80 |              87 |\n| MMBtu of natural gas            |             156 |             175 |\n\nConsideration  of  Credit  Risk  and  Concentrations -Xcel  Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its interest rate derivatives and commodity derivative contracts prior to settlement and assesses each counterparty's ability to perform on the transactions set forth in  the  contracts.  Impact  of  credit  risk  was  immaterial  to  the  fair  value  of unsettled  commodity  derivatives  presented  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets.\n\nXcel  Energy's  utility  subsidiaries'  most  significant  concentrations  of  credit risk with particular entities or industries are contracts with counterparties to their wholesale, trading and non-trading commodity activities.",

Three  of  the  10  most  significant  counterparties, comprising $44 million or  20% of this  credit  exposure,  were  not  rated  by these external agencies, but based on Xcel Energy's internal analysis, had credit  quality  consistent  with  investment  grade.

        "page_content": "Credit Related Contingent Features -Contract provisions for derivative instruments that the utility subsidiaries enter, including those accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale contracts and therefore not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, may require the posting of collateral or settlement of the contracts for various reasons, including if the applicable utility subsidiary's credit ratings are downgraded below its investment grade credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies. As of Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, there were $3 million and $4 million of derivative instruments in a liability  position  with  such  underlying  contract  provisions,  respectively. Certain contracts also contain cross default provisions that may require the posting  of  collateral  or  settlement  of  the  contracts  if  there  was  a  failure under the other financing arrangements related to payment terms or other covenants.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, there were approximately $64 million and $60  million  of  derivative  instruments  in  a  liability  position  with  such underlying contract provisions, respectively.\n\nCertain derivative  instruments  are  also  subject  to  contract  provisions  that contain  adequate  assurance  clauses.  Provisions  allow  counterparties  to seek performance assurance, including cash collateral, in the event that a given  utility  subsidiary's  ability  to  fulfill  its  contractual  obligations  is reasonably expected to be impaired. Xcel Energy had no collateral posted related  to  adequate  assurance  clauses  in  derivative  contracts  as  of  Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements - Derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:\n\nDec. 31, 2021\n\nDec. 31, 2020\n\nFair Value\n\nTotal\n\nFair Value\n\nTotal\n\nNetting\n\n(Millions of Dollars)\n\nCurrent derivative assets\n\nOther derivative instruments:\n\nCommodity trading\n\n$\n\n22\n\n$  137\n\n$\n\n21\n\n$\n\n180\n\n$\n\n(134)\n\n$\n\n46\n\n$\n\n2\n\n$\n\n67\n\n$\n\n1\n\n$\n\n70\n\n$\n\n(52)\n\n$\n\n18\n\nElectric commodity\n\n-\n\n-\n\n57\n\n57\n\n(1)\n\n56\n\n-\n\n-\n\n20\n\n20\n\n(1)\n\n19\n\nNatural gas commodity\n\n-\n\n18\n\n-\n\n18\n\n-\n\n18\n\n-\n\n9\n\n-\n\n9\n\n-\n\n9\n\nTotal current derivative assets\n\n$\n\n22\n\n$  155\n\n$\n\n78\n\n$\n\n255\n\n$\n\n(135)\n\n120\n\n$\n\n2\n\n$\n\n76\n\n$\n\n21\n\n$\n\n99\n\n$\n\n(53)\n\n46\n\n(b)\n\nPPAs\n\nCurrent derivative instruments\n\n$\n\n123\n\n$\n\n49\n\nNoncurrent derivative assets\n\nOther derivative instruments:\n\nCommodity trading\n\n$\n\n16\n\n$\n\n63\n\n$\n\n89\n\n$\n\n168\n\n$\n\n(107)\n\n$\n\n61\n\n$\n\n8\n\n$\n\n66\n\n$\n\n8\n\n$\n\n82\n\n$\n\n(62)\n\n$\n\n20\n\nTotal noncurrent derivative assets\n\n$\n\n16\n\n$\n\n63\n\n$\n\n89\n\n$\n\n168\n\n$\n\n(107)\n\n61\n\n$\n\n8\n\n$\n\n66\n\n$\n\n8\n\n$\n\n82\n\n$\n\n(62)\n\n20\n\n(b)\n\nPPAs\n\nNoncurrent derivative instruments\n\n$\n\n67\n\n$\n\n30\n\n|                                      | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021     | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2020     | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                      | Fair Value      | Fair Value      | Fair Value      |                   |                 |                 | Fair Value      | Fair Value      | Fair Value      |                   |                 |                 |\n| (Millions of Dollars)                | Level  1        | Level  2        | Level  3        | Fair Value  Total | Netting (a)     | Total           | Level  1        | Level  2        | Level  3        | Fair Value  Total | Netting (a)     | Total           |\n| Current derivative liabilities       |                 |                 |                 |                   |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |                   |                 |                 |\n| Other derivative instruments:        |                 |                 |                 |                   |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |                   |                 |                 |\n| Commodity trading                    | $  19           | $  148          | $  20           | $  187            | $  (143)        | $  44           | $  4            | $  64           | $  17           | $  85             | $  (58)         | $  27           |\n| Electric commodity                   | -               | -               | 1               | 1                 | (1)             | -               | -               | -               | 1               | 1                 | (1)             | -               |\n| Natural gas commodity                | -               | 8               | -               | 8                 | -               | 8               | -               | 9               | -               | 9                 | -               | 9               |\n| Total current derivative liabilities | $  19           | $  156          | $  21           | $  196            | $  (144)        | 52              | $  4            | $  73           | $  18           | $  95             | $  (59)         | 36              |\n| PPAs  (b)                            |                 |                 |                 |                   |                 | 17              |                 |                 |                 |                   |                 | 17              |\n| Current derivative instruments       |                 |                 |                 |                   |                 | $  69           |                 |                 |                 |                   |                 | $  53           |\n\nDec. 31, 2021\n\nDec. 31, 2020\n\n6\n\n10\n\n3\n\n3\n\nLevel\n\n1\n\nFair Value\n\nLevel\n\n2\n\nLevel\n\n3\n\n(a)\n\nNetting\n\nTotal\n\nLevel\n\n1\n\nFair Value\n\nLevel\n\n2\n\nLevel\n\n3\n\n(a)\n\nTotal",

There  were  no  transfers  of  amounts  between  levels  for derivative instruments for Dec. 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Fair Value of Long-Term Debt\n\nAs of Dec. 31, other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal fair value:\n\n|                                            | 2021             | 2021        | 2020             | 2020        |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars)                      | Carrying  Amount | Fair  Value | Carrying  Amount | Fair  Value |\n| Long-term debt, including current  portion | $  22,380        | $  25,232   | $  20,066        | $  24,412   |\n\nFair  value  of  Xcel  Energy's  long-term  debt  is  estimated  based  on  recent trades  and  observable  spreads  from  benchmark  interest  rates  for  similar securities.  Fair  value  estimates  are  based  on  information  available  to management as of Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, and given the observability of the inputs, fair values presented for long-term debt were assigned as Level 2.\n\n## 11.   Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits\n\nXcel Energy has several noncontributory, qualified, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all employees. All newly hired or rehired employees participate under the Cash Balance formula, which is based on pay credits using a percentage of annual eligible pay and annual interest credits. The average annual interest crediting rates for these plans was 2.03, 1.89 and 2.82%  in  2021,  2020,  and  2019,  respectively.  Some  employees  may participate under legacy formulas such as the traditional final average pay or pension equity. Xcel Energy's policy is to fully fund into an external trust the  actuarially  determined  pension  costs  subject  to  the  limitations  of applicable employee benefit and tax laws.\n\nIn addition to the qualified pension plans, Xcel Energy maintains a SERP and  a  nonqualified  pension  plan.  The  SERP  is  maintained  for  certain executives  who  participated  in  the  plan  in  2008,  when  the  SERP  was closed to new participants.\n\nThe nonqualified pension plan provides benefits for compensation that is in excess  of  the  limits  applicable  to  the  qualified  pension  plans,  with distributions funded by Xcel Energy's consolidated operating cash flows.\n\nObligations  of  the  SERP  and  nonqualified  plan  as  of  Dec.  31,  2021  and 2020  were  $43  million  and  $43  million,  respectively.  Xcel  Energy recognized  net  benefit  cost  for  the  SERP  and  nonqualified  plans  of  $4 million in 2021 and $6 million in 2020.\n\nXcel Energy's investment-return assumption considers the expected longterm  performance  for  each  of  the  asset  classes  in  its  pension  and postretirement  health  care  portfolio.  Xcel  Energy  considers  the  historical returns achieved by its asset portfolios over long time periods, as well as long-term projected return levels.\n\nPension cost determination assumes a forecasted mix of investment types over the long-term.\n\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2021 were above the assumed level of 6.49%.\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2020 were above the assumed level of 6.87%.\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2019 were above the assumed level of 6.87%.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, expected investment-return assumption is 6.49%.\n\nPension plan and postretirement benefit assets are invested in a portfolio according to Xcel Energy's return, liquidity and diversification objectives to provide a source of funding for plan obligations and minimize contributions to  the  plan,  within  appropriate  levels  of  risk.  The  principal  mechanism  for achieving these objectives is the asset allocation given the long-term risk, return,  correlation  and  liquidity  characteristics  of  each  particular  asset class.\n\nThere were no significant concentrations of risk in any industry, index, or entity.  Market  volatility  can  impact  even  well-diversified  portfolios  and significantly affect the return levels achieved by the assets in any year.\n\nState agencies also have issued guidelines to the funding of postretirement benefit costs. SPS is required to fund postretirement benefit costs for Texas and  New  Mexico  amounts  collected  in  rates.  PSCo  is  required  to  fund postretirement benefit costs in irrevocable external trusts that are dedicated to the payment of these postretirement benefits. These assets are invested in a manner consistent with the investment strategy for the pension plan.\n\nXcel  Energy's  ongoing  investment  strategy  is  based  on  plan-specific investment  recommendations  that  seek  to  minimize  potential  investment and interest  rate  risk  as  a  plan's  funded  status  increases  over  time.  The investment recommendations consider many factors and generally result in a  greater  percentage  of  long-duration  fixed  income  securities  being allocated to specific plans having relatively higher funded status ratios and a  greater  percentage  of  growth  assets  being  allocated  to  plans  having relatively lower funded status ratios.",

Total  expense  to  these  plans  was  approximately $43 million in 2021, $42 million in 2020 and $39 million in 2019.\n\n## Multiemployer Plans\n\nNSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  each  contribute  to  several  union multiemployer  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plans,  none  of which  are  individually  significant.  These  plans  provide  pension  and postretirement  health  care  benefits  to  certain  union  employees  who  may perform services for multiple employers and do not participate in the NSPMinnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  sponsored  pension  and  postretirement health care plans.\n\nContributing to these types of plans creates risk that differs from providing benefits  under  NSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  sponsored  plans,  in that if another  participating employer  ceases  to  contribute  to  a multiemployer plan, additional unfunded obligations may need to be funded over time by remaining participating employers.\n\n## 12.   Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Legal\n\nXcel Energy is involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility,  and  whether  the  loss  or  a  range  of  loss  is  estimable,  often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management maintains  accruals  for  losses  probable  of  being  incurred  and  subject  to reasonable  estimation.  Management  is  sometimes  unable  to  estimate  an amount  or  range  of  a  reasonably  possible  loss  in  certain  situations, including but not limited to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories.\n\nIn  such  cases,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  the  timing  or ultimate  resolution,  including  a  possible  eventual  loss.  For  current proceedings  not  specifically  reported  herein,  management  does  not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on Xcel Energy's consolidated financial statements. Legal fees are generally expensed as incurred.\n\nGas  Trading  Litigation -e  prime  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of Xcel  Energy.  e  prime  was  in  the  business  of  natural  gas  trading  and marketing but has not engaged in natural gas trading or marketing activities since 2003. Multiple lawsuits involving multiple plaintiffs seeking monetary damages  were  commenced  against  e  prime  and  its  affiliates,  including Xcel  Energy,  between  2003  and  2009  alleging  fraud  and  anticompetitive activities in conspiring to restrain the trade of natural gas and manipulate natural gas prices. Cases were all consolidated in the U.S. District Court in Nevada.\n\nOne  case  remains  active  which  includes  a  multi-district  litigation  matter consisting of a Wisconsin purported class (Arandell Corp.).\n\nArandell Corp. - The trial has been vacated and will be rescheduled after the  court  rules  on  the  pending  motions  for  reconsideration  and  for  class certification.  Xcel  Energy  has  concluded  that  a  loss  is  remote  for  the remaining lawsuit.\n\nBreckenridge/Colorado -  In  February  2019,  the  MDL  panel  remanded Breckenridge  back  to  the  U.S.  District  Court  in  Colorado.  Settlement  of approximately $3 million was reached in February 2021. In July 2021, the settlement was approved.",

        "page_content": "## Rate Matters and Other\n\nXcel  Energy's  operating  subsidiaries  are  involved  in  various  regulatory proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Until  resolution, typically in the form of a rate order, uncertainties may exist regarding the ultimate rate treatment for certain activities and transactions. Amounts have been  recognized  for  probable  and  reasonably  estimable  losses  that  may result. Unless otherwise disclosed, any reasonably possible range of loss in excess of any recognized amount is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nMinnesota Winter Storm Uri Costs - In its Minnesota jurisdiction, NSPMinnesota  is  participating  in  a  contested  case  regarding  the  prudency  of incremental  natural  gas  costs  incurred  during  Winter  Storm  Uri.  Other parties to the case have recommended significant cost disallowances, and while ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the MPUC could disallow certain deferred costs, resulting in earnings losses.  The  OAG  recommended  the  MPUC  deny  recovery  of  up  to $179 million, the largest recommendation among the intervenor positions.\n\nNSP-Minnesota strongly disagrees with the recommendations of the DOC, OAG and CUB, and believes that it acted prudently and according to MPUC approved  procedures  for  the  best  interest  of  its  customers  and stakeholders.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  filed  rebuttal  testimony  in  January  2022  detailing  its position  that  the  disallowances  recommended  by  other  parties  lack  any merit  in  the  prudency  review  given  the  pertinent  facts  regarding  NSPMinnesota's  actions  before,  during  and  after  the  storm  event.  An  MPUC decision is expected in the summer of 2022.\n\nSherco -In  2018,  NSP-Minnesota  and  Southern  Minnesota  Municipal Power Agency (Co-owner of Sherco Unit 3) reached a settlement with GE related to a 2011 incident, which damaged the turbine at Sherco Unit 3 and resulted  in  an  extended  outage  for  repair.  NSP-Minnesota  notified  the MPUC of its proposal to refund settlement proceeds to customers through the FCA.\n\nIn  March  2019,  the  MPUC  approved  NSP-Minnesota's  settlement  refund proposal.  Additionally,  the  MPUC  decided  to  withhold  any  decision  as  to NSP-Minnesota's prudence in connection with the incident at Sherco Unit 3 until  after  conclusion  of  an  appeal  pending  between  GE  and  NSPMinnesota's  insurers.  In  February  2020,  the  Minnesota  Court  of  Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment in favor of GE. In March 2020, NSPMinnesota's  insurers  filed  a  petition  seeking  additional  review  by  the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n\nIn April 2020, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied the insurers' petition for further review, ending the litigation.\n\nIn  January  2021,  the  OAG  and  DOC  recommended  that  NSP-Minnesota refund  approximately  $17  million  of  replacement  power  costs  previously recovered  through  the  FCA.  NSP-Minnesota  subsequently  filed  its response,  asserting  that  it  acted  prudently  in  connection  with  the  Sherco Unit 3 outage, the MPUC has previously disallowed $22 million of related costs  and  no  additional  refund  or  disallowance  is  appropriate.  A  final decision by the MPUC is pending. A loss related to this matter is deemed remote.\n\nWestmoreland  Arbitration -In November  2014,  insurers  of  the Westmoreland  Coal  Company  filed  an  arbitration  demand  against  NSPMinnesota,  Southern  Minnesota  Municipal  Power  Agency  and  Western Fuels  Association,  seeking  recovery  of  alleged  $36  million  of  business losses due to a turbine failure at Sherco Unit 3. The Westmoreland insurers claim NSP-Minnesota's invocation of the force majeure clause to stop the supply of coal was improper because the incident was allegedly caused by NSP-Minnesota's failure to conform to industry maintenance standards.\n\nNSP-Minnesota denies the claims asserted by the Westmoreland insurers and believes it properly stopped the supply of coal based upon the force majeure provision. A final hearing has been scheduled for October 2022. The parties are also required to participate in mediation, which has been scheduled for the first quarter of 2022. At this stage of the proceeding, a reasonable  estimate  of  damages  or  range  of  damages  cannot  be determined.\n\nMISO  ROE  Complaints -  In  November  2013  and  February  2015, customer  groups  filed  two  ROE  complaints  against  MISO  TOs,  which includes NSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin.  The  first complaint requested  a  reduction  in  base  ROE  transmission  formula  rates  from 12.38% to 9.15% for the time period of Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015, and removal of ROE adders (including those for RTO membership). The second complaint requested, for a subsequent time period, a base ROE reduction from 12.38% to 8.67%.\n\nIn September 2016, the FERC issued an order (Opinion No. 551) granting a 10.32% base ROE effective for the first complaint period of Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015 and subsequent to the date of the order. The D.C Circuit subsequently vacated and remanded Opinion No. 551.\n\nIn November 2019, the FERC issued an order (Opinion No. 569), which set the  MISO  base  ROE  at  9.88%,  effective  Sept.  28,  2016  and  for  the  first complaint  period.  The  FERC  also  dismissed  the  second  complaint.  In December 2019, MISO TOs filed a request for rehearing regarding the new ROE  methodology  announced  in  Opinion  No.  569.  Customers  also  filed requests for rehearing claiming, among other points, that the FERC erred by dismissing the second complaint without refunds.\n\nIn May 2020, the FERC issued an order (Opinion No. 569-A) which granted rehearing  in  part  to  Opinion  569  and  further  refined  the  FERC's  ROE methodology, most significantly to incorporate the risk premium model (in addition  to  the  discounted  cash  flow  and  capital  asset  pricing  models), resulting in a new base ROE of 10.02%, effective Sept. 28, 2016 and for the first complaint period. The FERC also affirmed its decision in Opinion No. 569 to dismiss the second complaint.\n\nIn  November  2020,  the  FERC  issued  an  order  (Opinion  No.  569-B)  in response to rehearing requests. The FERC corrected certain inputs to its ROE calculation model, did not change the ROE effective Sept. 28, 2016, and  for  the  first  MISO  complaint  period  and  upheld  its  decision  to  deny refunds for the second complaint period. NSP-Minnesota has recognized a liability  for  its  best  estimate  of  final  refunds  to  customers.  Each  10  basis point  reduction  in  ROE  for  the  first  complaint  period,  second  complaint period  and  subsequent  period  relative  to  amounts  accrued  would  reduce Xcel  Energy's  net  income  by  $1  million,  $1  million  and  $2  million, respectively.\n\nThe MISO TOs and various parties have filed petitions for review of Opinion Nos. 569, 569-A and 569-B at the D.C. Circuit. Oral arguments were held in late 2021 and a decision is expected by the end of the third quarter of 2022.",

        "page_content": "SPP  OATT  Upgrade  Costs - Costs  of  transmission  upgrades  may  be recovered from other SPP customers whose transmission service depends on capacity enabled by the upgrade under the SPP OATT. SPP had not been  charging  its  customers  for  these  upgrades,  even  though  the  SPP OATT had allowed SPP to do so since 2008. In 2016, the FERC granted SPP's  request  to  recover  these  previously  unbilled  charges  and  SPP subsequently billed SPS approximately $13 million.\n\nIn  July  2018,  SPS'  appeal  to  the  D.C.  Circuit  over  the  FERC  rulings granting  SPP  the  right  to  recover  previously  unbilled  charges  was remanded  to  the  FERC.  In  February  2019,  the  FERC  reversed  its  2016 decision and ordered SPP to refund charges retroactively collected from its transmission customers,  including  SPS,  related  to  periods  before September 2015.\n\nIn March 2020, SPP and Oklahoma Gas & Electric separately filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders at the D.C. Circuit. In August 2021, the D.C Circuit issued a decision denying these appeals and upholding the FERC's orders.  Refunds received by SPS are expected to be given back to SPS customers through future rates. The timing of these refunds is uncertain.\n\nIn  October  2017,  SPS  filed  a  separate  related  complaint  asserting  SPP assessed upgrade charges to SPS in violation of the SPP OATT. In March 2018, the FERC issued an order denying the SPS complaint. SPS filed a request  for  rehearing  in  April  2018.  The  FERC  issued  a  tolling  order granting  a  rehearing  for  further  consideration  in  May  2018.  If  SPS' complaint results in additional charges or refunds, SPS will seek to recover or refund the amount through future SPS customer rates. In October 2020, SPS filed a petition for review of the FERC's March 2018 order and May 2018 tolling order at the D.C. Circuit. FERC has asked that this appeal be stayed  until  early  2022,  in  order  to  provide  FERC  with  time  to  issue  an order on SPS' April 2018 rehearing request. FERC's order is expected in the  first  quarter  of  2022.  The  D.C.  Circuit  appeal  may  resume  after  that FERC order is issued.\n\nWind Operating Commitments - PUCT and NMPRC orders related to the  Hale  and  Sagamore  wind  projects  included  certain  operating  and savings  minimums.  In  general,  annual  generation  must  exceed  a  net capacity factor of 48%. If annual generation is below the guaranteed level, SPS would be obligated to refund an amount equal to foregone PTCs and fuel  savings.  Additionally,  retail  customer  savings  must  exceed  project costs  included  in  base  rates  over  the  first  ten  years  of  operations.  SPS would  be  required  to  refund  excess  costs,  if  any,  after  ten  years  of operations.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2021,  the  full-year  net  capacity  factor  was 48.4%, resulting in no refund liability for 2021.\n\nContract Termination -SPS and LP&L are parties to a 25-year, 170 MW partial  requirements  contract.  In  May  2021,  SPS  and  LP&L  finalized  a settlement which would terminate the contract upon LP&L's move from the SPP to  the  Electric  Reliability  Council  of  Texas  (expected  in  2023).  The settlement agreement requires LP&L to pay SPS $78 million (lump sum or annual  installments),  to  the  benefit  of  SPS'  remaining  customers.  LP&L would  remain  obligated  to  pay  for  SPP  transmission  charges  associated with LP&L's load in SPP. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the PUCT and FERC.\n\nComanche  Unit  3  Litigation -In  February  2021,  the  joint  owners  of Comanche  Unit  3  (CORE  Electric  Cooperative,  formerly  known  as Intermountain Rural Electrical Association, and Holy Cross Electric) served PSCo with a notice of claim related to Comanche Unit 3's operation and availability.\n\nIn September 2021, CORE Electric Cooperative filed a lawsuit in Colorado state  court  seeking  an  unspecified  amount  of  damages.  CORE  Electric Cooperative alleges PSCo breached ownership agreement terms by failing to  operate  Comanche  Unit  3  in  accordance  with  prudent  utility  practices. PSCo filed a Motion to Dismiss several of CORE's claims. In January 2022 the Court granted PSCo's Motion to Dismiss CORE's claim for damages for replacement  power  costs,  claims  for  unjust  enrichment  and  declaratory judgment. CORE's claims for breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and waste remain pending.\n\nIn November 2021, PSCo resolved all differences with Holy Cross Electric related to their claim.\n\n## Environmental\n\nNew and changing federal and state environmental mandates can create financial  liabilities  for  Xcel  Energy,  which  are  normally  recovered  through the regulated rate process.\n\n## Site Remediation\n\nVarious  federal  and  state  environmental  laws  impose  liability  where hazardous substances or other regulated materials have been released to the environment. Xcel Energy Inc.'s subsidiaries may sometimes pay all or a  portion  of  the  cost  to  remediate  sites  where  past  activities  of  their predecessors or other parties have caused environmental contamination.\n\nEnvironmental contingencies could arise from various situations, including sites of former MGPs; and third-party sites, such as landfills, for which one or more of Xcel Energy Inc.'s subsidiaries are alleged to have sent wastes to that site.\n\n## Historical MGP, Landfill and Disposal Sites\n\nXcel  Energy  is  currently  investigating,  remediating  or  performing  postclosure actions at 16 historical MGP, landfill or other disposal sites across its  service  territories,  excluding  sites  that  are  being  addressed  under current coal ash regulations (see below).\n\nXcel Energy has recognized its best estimate of costs/liabilities from final resolution of these issues; however, the outcome and timing are unknown. In  addition,  there  may  be  insurance  recovery  and/or  recovery  from  other potentially responsible parties, offsetting a portion of costs incurred.\n\n## Environmental Requirements -Water and Waste\n\nCoal Ash Regulation -Xcel Energy's operations are subject to federal and state regulations that impose requirements for handling, storage, treatment and disposal of solid waste. Under the CCR Rule, utilities are required to complete  groundwater  sampling  around  their  CCR  landfills  and  surface impoundments.  Currently,  Xcel  Energy  has  eight  regulated  ash  units  in operation.\n\nXcel  Energy  is  conducting  groundwater  sampling  and  monitoring  and implementing assessment of corrective measures at certain CCR landfills and  surface  impoundments.  In  NSP-Minnesota,  no  results  above  the groundwater  protection  standards  in  the  rule  were  identified.  In  PSCo, increases  above  background  concentrations  were  detected  at  four locations.  Based  on  further  assessments,  PSCo  is  evaluating  options  for corrective  action  at  two  locations,  one  of  which  indicates  potential  offsite impacts  to  groundwater.  The  total  cost  is  uncertain,  but  could  be  up  to $35  million.  PSCo  is  continuing  to  assess  the  financial  and  regulatory impacts.",

        "page_content": "In  August  2020,  the  EPA  published  its  final  rule  to  implement  closure  by April  2021  for  all  CCR  impoundments  affected  by  the  August  2018  D.C. Circuit ruling. This final rule required Xcel Energy to expedite closure plans for two impoundments.\n\nIn  October  2020,  NSP-Minnesota  completed  construction  and  placed  in service a new impoundment to replace the clay lined impoundment. With the new ash pond in service, NSP-Minnesota has initiated closure activities for the existing ash pond at an estimated cost of $4 million. NSP-Minnesota has five years to complete closure activities.\n\nPSCo also built an alternative collection and treatment system to remove the Comanche Station bottom ash pond from service. The total cost of the alternate  treatment  system  is  approximately  $25  million.  PSCo  worked expeditiously  to  meet  the  April  11,  2021  deadline,  but  was  not  able  to remove  the  pond  from  service  until  June  18,  2021.  PSCo  expects  to negotiate a compliance order with the EPA addressing the closure deadline as well as other potential issues. PSCo will also now proceed with closure of the pond, at an estimated cost of $3 million.\n\nClosure costs for existing impoundments are included in the calculation of the ARO.\n\nFederal  CWA  Waters  of  the  U.S.  Rule -Xcel  Energy  is  monitoring ongoing changes to the definition  of  Waters  of  the  U.S.  under  the  CWA. Regardless  of  which  definition  is  applicable  in  the  states  in  which  we operate,  Xcel  Energy  does  not  anticipate  that  compliance  costs  will  be material.\n\nFederal CWA ELG - In 2015, the EPA issued a final ELG rule for power plants  that  discharge  treated  effluent  to  surface  waters  as  well  as  utilityowned landfills that receive CCRs. In October 2020, the EPA published a final rule revising the regulations.\n\nThe retirement of units affected by the final ELG rule is subject to regulatory approval. The exact total cost of ELG compliance is therefore uncertain but Xcel Energy does not anticipate that compliance costs will be material.\n\nFederal  CWA  Section  316(b) -  The  federal  CWA  requires  the  EPA  to regulate  cooling  water  intake  structures  to  assure  that  these  structures reflect  the  best  technology  available  for  minimizing  impingement  and entrainment of aquatic species. Xcel Energy estimates the likely future cost for complying  with  impingement  and  entrainment  requirements  is approximately  $39  million,  to  be  incurred  between  2022  and  2028.  Xcel Energy believes six NSP-Minnesota plants and two NSP-Wisconsin plants could  be  required  to  make  improvements  to  reduce  impingement  and entrainment.  The  exact  total  cost  of  the  impingement  and  entrainment improvements is uncertain,  but  could  be  up  to  $192  million.  Xcel  Energy anticipates  these  costs  will  be  fully  recoverable  through  regulatory mechanisms.\n\n## Environmental Requirements -Air\n\nRegional Haze Rules - The regional haze program requires SO2, nitrogen oxide  and  particulate  matter  emission  controls  at  power  plants  to  reduce visibility  impairment  in  national  parks  and  wilderness  areas.  The  program includes  BART  and  reasonable  further  progress.  The  regional  haze  first planning period requirements developed by Minnesota and Colorado were approved  by  the  EPA  in  2012  and  implemented  by  2014  and  2016, respectively. Texas' first regional haze plan has undergone federal review.\n\nAll  states  are  now  subject  to  a  second  round  of  regional  haze  planning/ rulemaking, focusing on additional reductions to meet reasonable progress requirements. Any additional impacts to Xcel Energy facilities are expected to be minimal.\n\nBART Determination  for  Texas: The  EPA  has  issued  a  revised  final  rule adopting a BART alternative Texas only SO2 trading program that applies to  all  Harrington and Tolk units. Under the trading program, SPS expects the  allowance  allocations  to  be  sufficient  for  SO2  emissions.  The anticipated costs of compliance are not expected to have a material impact; and  SPS  believes  that  compliance  costs  would  be  recoverable  through regulatory mechanisms.\n\nSeveral parties have challenged whether the final rule issued by the EPA should be considered to have met the requirements imposed in a Consent Decree entered by the D.C. Circuit that established deadlines for the EPA to take final action on state regional haze plan submissions. The court has required  status  reports  from  the  parties  while  the  EPA  works  on  the reconsideration rulemaking.\n\nIn  December  2017,  the  National  Parks  Conservation  Association,  Sierra Club,  and  Environmental  Defense  Fund  appealed  the  EPA's  2017  final BART  rule  to  the  Fifth  Circuit  and  filed  a  petition  for  administrative reconsideration. The court has held the litigation in abeyance while the EPA decided whether to reconsider the rule. In August 2018, the EPA started a reconsideration  rulemaking.  The  EPA  reaffirmed  the  rule  in  August  2020 with minor changes.\n\nThe 2020 EPA Action has been challenged. All pending actions could be consolidated and may proceed in the Fifth Circuit or the D.C. Circuit, where a parallel challenge has been filed. The timing of final decisions is unclear.\n\nReasonable  Progress  Rule: In  2016,  the  EPA  adopted  a  final  rule establishing a federal implementation plan for reasonable further progress under the regional haze program for the state of Texas. The rule imposes SO2 emission limitations that would require the installation of dry scrubbers on Tolk Units 1 and 2; compliance would have been required by February 2021.  Investment  costs  associated  with  dry  scrubbers  could  be  $600 million. SPS appealed the EPA's decision and obtained a stay of the final rule.\n\nIn  March  2017,  the  Fifth  Circuit  remanded  the  rule  to  the  EPA  for reconsideration, leaving the stay in effect. In a future rulemaking, the EPA will address whether SO2 emission reductions beyond those required in the BART  alternative  rule  referenced  above  are  needed  at  Tolk  under  the 'reasonable progress' requirements. As states are now proceeding with the second regional haze planning period, the EPA may choose not to act on the remanded rule.\n\nImplementation  of  the  NAAQS  for  SO2 -  The  EPA  has  designated  all areas near SPS' generating plants as attaining the SO2 NAAQS with one exception. The EPA issued final designations, which found the area near the SPS Harrington plant as 'unclassifiable.' The area near the Harrington plant was monitored for the three years ending in 2019 and the monitoring showed the area to be exceeding the standard.\n\nTo address this issue, SPS negotiated an order with the TCEQ providing for the end of coal combustion and the conversion of the Harrington plant to a natural gas fueled facility by Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nXcel  Energy  believes  compliance  costs  or  the  costs  of  alternative  costeffective  generation  will  be  recoverable  through  regulatory  mechanisms and therefore does not expect a material impact on results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nAROs - AROs have been recorded for Xcel Energy's assets. For nuclear assets, the ARO is associated with the decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota nuclear generating plants.",

Therefore, an ARO was not recorded for these facilities.\n\n## Nuclear\n\nNuclear Insurance - NSP-Minnesota's public liability for claims from any nuclear  incident  is  limited  to  $13.5  billion  under  the  Price-Anderson amendment to the Atomic Energy Act. NSP-Minnesota has secured $450 million of coverage for its public liability exposure with a pool of insurance companies.  The  remaining  $13.0  billion  of  exposure  is  funded  by  the Secondary  Financial  Protection  Program  available  from  assessments  by the federal government.\n\nNSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to $138 million per reactorincident  for  each  of  its  three  reactors,  for  public  liability  arising  from  a nuclear  incident  at  any  licensed  nuclear  facility  in  the  United  States.  The maximum funding requirement is $21 million per reactor-incident during any one year. Maximum assessments are subject to inflation adjustments.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  purchases  insurance  for  property  damage  and  site decontamination cleanup costs from NEIL and EMANI. The coverage limits are $2.8 billion for each of NSP-Minnesota's two nuclear plant sites. NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage up to $350 million, including  the  cost  of  replacement  power  during  prolonged  accidental outages  of  nuclear  generating  units.  Premiums  are  expensed  over  the policy term.\n\nAll  companies  insured  with  NEIL  are  subject  to  retroactive  premium adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated  in  the  reserve  funds  of  NEIL  and  EMANI  to  the  extent  that NSP-Minnesota  would  have  no  exposure  for  retroactive  premium assessments in  case  of  a  single  incident  under  the  business  interruption and the property damage insurance coverage.\n\nNSP-Minnesota could be subject to annual maximum assessments of $11 million  for  business  interruption  insurance  and  $33  million  for  property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.\n\nNuclear  Fuel  Disposal - NSP-Minnesota is  responsible  for  temporarily storing spent nuclear fuel from its nuclear plants. The DOE is responsible for  permanently  storing  spent  fuel  from  U.S.  nuclear  plants,  but  no  such facility is yet available.\n\nNSP-Minnesota owns temporary on-site storage facilities for spent fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear plants, which consist of storage pools and dry cask facilities. The Monticello dry-cask storage facility currently stores all 30 of the authorized canisters. The PI dry-cask storage facility currently stores 47 of the 64 authorized casks. Monticello's future spent fuel will continue to be placed in its spent fuel pool. The decommissioning plan addresses the disposition of spent fuel at the end of the licensed life. A CON for additional storage  at  the  Monticello  site  has  been  filed  with  the  MPUC,  to  support possible  life  extension.  NSP-Minnesota  expects  a  decision  by  year-end 2023.\n\nRegulatory  Plant  Decommissioning  Recovery -  Decommissioning activities for NSP-Minnesota's nuclear facilities are planned to begin at the end  of  each  unit's  operating  license  and  be  completed  by  2091.  NSPMinnesota's current operating licenses allow continued use of its Monticello nuclear plant until 2030 and its PI nuclear plant until 2033 for Unit 1 and 2034 for Unit 2.",

        "page_content": "Future  decommissioning  costs  of  nuclear  facilities  are  estimated  through triennial  periodic  studies  that  assess  the  costs  and  timing  of  planned nuclear decommissioning activities for each unit.\n\nObligations for decommissioning are expected to be funded 100% by the external decommissioning trust fund. The cost study assumes the external decommissioning  fund  will  earn  an  after-tax  return  between  5.23%  and 6.30%.\n\nRealized  and  unrealized  gains  on  fund  investments  are  deferred  as  an offset  of  NSP-Minnesota's  regulatory  asset  for  nuclear  decommissioning costs.  Decommissioning  costs  are  quantified  in  2014  dollars.  Escalation rates are 4.36% for plant removal activities and 3.36% for fuel management and site restoration activities.\n\nNSP-Minnesota had $3.3 billion of assets held in external decommissioning trusts at Dec. 31, 2021. The following table summarizes the funded status of  NSP-Minnesota's  decommissioning  obligation.  Xcel  Energy  believes future  decommissioning  costs  will  continue  to  be  recovered  in  customer rates. The following amounts were prepared on a regulatory basis and not directly recorded in the financial statements as an ARO.\n\n|                                                                                                                              | Regulatory Basis   | Regulatory Basis   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                                                                        | 2021               | 2020               |\n| Estimated decommissioning cost obligation from most recently  approved study (in 2014 dollars)                               | $  3,012           | $  3,012           |\n| Effect of escalating costs                                                                                                   | 1,006              | 844                |\n| Estimated decommissioning cost obligation (in current dollars)                                                               | 4,018              | 3,856              |\n| Effect of escalating costs to payment date                                                                                   | 7,187              | 7,349              |\n| Estimated future decommissioning costs (undiscounted)                                                                        | 11,205             | 11,205             |\n| Effect of discounting obligation (using average risk-free interest  rate of 1.96% and 1.64% for 2021 and 2020, respectively) | (4,651)            | (4,181)            |\n| Discounted decommissioning cost obligation                                                                                   | $  6,554           | $  7,024           |\n| Assets held in external decommissioning trust                                                                                | $  3,256           | $  2,777           |\n| Underfunding of external decommissioning fund compared to the  discounted decommissioning obligation                         | 3,298              | 4,247              |\n\nCalculations and data used by the regulator in approving NSP-Minnesota's rates  are  useful  in  assessing  future  cash  flows.

In  March  2020,  the  MPUC  approved  for  NSPMinnesota  to  delay  any  increase  to  the  annual  funding  requirement  until 2021. In December 2020, the MPUC verbally approved for NSP-Minnesota to  delay  any  increase  to  the  annual  funding  requirement  until  2022.  In December 2021, NSP-Minnesota submitted a Petition for approval of the 2022  2024  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Study  and  Assumptions. Contemplated but not proposed in this filing, was the 10-year extension of the license to operate the Monticello Plant, moving the planned retirement date  from  2030  to  2040.  The  2019  Preferred  Integrated  Resource  Plan Supplement does include a 10-year extension of the license. On Feb. 8, 2022, the MPUC approved the 10-year extension.\n\n## Leases\n\nXcel Energy evaluates contracts that may contain leases, including PPAs and arrangements for the use of office space and other facilities, vehicles and equipment. A contract contains a lease if it conveys the exclusive right to  control  the  use  of  a  specific  asset.  A  contract  determined  to  contain  a lease  is  evaluated  further  to  determine  if  the  arrangement  is  a  finance lease.\n\nROU  assets  represent  Xcel  Energy's  rights  to  use  leased  assets.  The present  value  of  future  operating  lease  payments  is  recognized  in  other current liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities. These amounts, adjusted  for  any  prepayments  or  incentives,  are  recognized  as  operating lease ROU assets.\n\nMost  of  Xcel  Energy's  leases  do  not  contain  a  readily  determinable discount  rate.  Therefore,  the  present  value  of  future  lease  payments  is generally  calculated  using  the  applicable  Xcel  Energy  subsidiary's estimated  incremental  borrowing  rate  (weighted  average  of  4.0%).  Xcel Energy  has  elected  the  practical  expedient  under  which  non-lease components, such as asset maintenance costs included in payments, are not  deducted  from  minimum  lease  payments  for  the  purposes  of  lease accounting and disclosure.\n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are classified as short-term leases and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Operating lease ROU assets:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)            | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| PPAs                             | $  1,656        | $  1,650        |\n| Other                            | 225             | 212             |\n| Gross operating lease ROU assets | 1,881           | 1,862           |\n| Accumulated amortization         | (590)           | (372)           |\n| Net operating lease ROU assets   | $  1,291        | $  1,490        |\n\nROU assets for finance leases are included in other noncurrent assets, and the  present  value  of  future  finance  lease  payments  is  included  in  other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\n\nXcel Energy's most significant finance lease activities are related to WYCO, a joint venture with CIG, to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities. Xcel Energy Inc. has a 50% ownership interest in  WYCO.  WYCO  leases  its  facilities  to  CIG,  and  CIG  operates  the facilities, providing natural gas storage and transportation services to PSCo under separate service agreements.\n\nPSCo accounts for its Totem natural gas storage service and Front Range pipeline  arrangements  with  CIG  and  WYCO,  respectively,  as  finance leases.  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  eliminates  50%  of  the  finance  lease  obligation related  to  WYCO  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  along  with  an  equal amount of Xcel Energy Inc.'s equity investment in WYCO.",

In  general,  these agreements  provide  for  energy  payments,  based  on  actual  energy delivered  and  capacity  payments.  Certain  PPAs,  accounted  for  as executory  contracts  with  various  expiration  dates  through  2033,  contain minimum energy purchase commitments. Total energy payments on those contracts were $149 million, $112 million and $102 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nIncluded  in  electric  fuel  and  purchased  power  expenses  for  PPAs accounted  for  as  executory  contracts  were  payments  for  capacity  of $69  million,  $75  million  and  $86  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively.\n\nCapacity  and  energy  payments  are  contingent  on  the  IPPs  meeting contract  obligations,  including  plant  availability  requirements.  Certain contractual payments are adjusted based on market indices. The effects of price  adjustments  on  financial  results  are  mitigated  through  purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms.\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2021, the estimated future payments for capacity and energy that  the  utility  subsidiaries  of  Xcel  Energy  are  obligated  to  purchase pursuant  to  these  executory  contracts,  subject  to  availability,  were  as follows:\n\n(a)\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)   | Capacity   | Energy   |\n|-------------------------|------------|----------|\n| 2022                    | $  75      | $  165   |\n| 2023                    | 77         | 169      |\n| 2024                    | 72         | 174      |\n| 2025                    | 29         | 53       |\n| 2026                    | 12         | 10       |\n| Thereafter              | 12         | 38       |\n| Total                   | $  277     | $  609   |\n\nFuel  Contracts -Xcel  Energy  has  entered  into  various  long-term commitments  for  the  purchase  and  delivery  of  a  significant  portion  of  its coal,  nuclear  fuel  and  natural  gas  requirements.

Xcel  Energy  has  determined  that  certain  IPPs  are  VIEs. Xcel  Energy  is  not  subject  to  risk  of  loss  from  the  operations  of  these entities,  and  no  significant  financial  support  is  required  other  than contractual payments for energy and capacity.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  solar  PPAs  provide  an  option  to  purchase  emission allowances or sharing provisions related to production credits generated by the  solar  facility  under  contract.  These  specific  PPAs  create  a  variable interest in the IPP.\n\nXcel  Energy  evaluated  each  of  these  VIEs  for  possible  consolidation, including review of qualitative factors such as the length and terms of the contract,  control  over  O&M,  control  over  dispatch  of  electricity,  historical and estimated future fuel and electricity prices, and financing activities. Xcel Energy concluded that these entities are not required to be consolidated in its consolidated financial statements because it does not have the power to direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  the  entities'  economic performance.",

These  agreements  have  expiration  dates through 2041.\n\nFuel  Contracts -  SPS  purchases  all  of  its  coal  requirements  for  its Harrington and Tolk plants from TUCO Inc. under contracts that will expire in December  2022.  TUCO  arranges  for  the  purchase,  receiving, transporting, unloading, handling, crushing, weighing and delivery of coal to meet  SPS'  requirements.  TUCO  is  responsible  for  negotiating  and administering contracts with coal suppliers, transporters and handlers.\n\nSPS has not provided any significant financial support to TUCO, other than contractual payments for delivered coal. However, the fuel contracts create a variable interest in TUCO due to SPS' reimbursement of fuel procurement costs.\n\nSPS has determined that TUCO is a VIE, however it has concluded that SPS is not the primary beneficiary of TUCO because it does not have the power  to  direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  TUCO's economic performance.\n\nLow-Income  Housing  Limited  Partnerships -  Eloigne  and  NSPWisconsin have entered into limited partnerships for the construction and operation of affordable rental housing developments which qualify for lowincome housing tax credits. Xcel Energy Inc. has determined Eloigne and NSP-Wisconsin's low-income housing partnerships to be VIEs primarily due to  contractual  arrangements within each limited partnership that establish sharing of ongoing voting control and profits and losses that does not align with the partners' proportional equity ownership.\n\nEloigne  and  NSP-Wisconsin  have  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  that most significantly impact these entities' economic performance. Therefore, Xcel Energy Inc. consolidates these limited partnerships in its consolidated financial  statements.  Xcel  Energy's  risk  of  loss  for  these  partnerships  is limited  to  its  capital  contributions,  adjusted  for  any  distributions  and  its share of undistributed profits and losses; no significant additional financial support has been, or is required to be, provided to the limited partnerships by Eloigne or NSP-Wisconsin.\n\nAmounts  reflected  in  Xcel  Energy's  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  the Eloigne and NSP-Wisconsin low-income housing limited partnerships:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                      | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Current assets                             | $  7            | $  7            |\n| Property, plant and equipment, net         | 37              | 38              |\n| Other noncurrent assets                    | 1               | 1               |\n| Total assets                               | $  45           | $  46           |\n| Current liabilities                        | $  7            | $  8            |\n| Mortgages and other long-term debt payable | 27              | 25              |\n| Other noncurrent liabilities               | 1               | 1               |\n| Total liabilities                          | $  35           | $  34           |\n\n## Other\n\nTechnology  Agreements -  Xcel  Energy  has  several  contracts  for information  technology  services  that  extend  through  2022.  The  contracts are cancelable, although there are financial penalties for early termination. Xcel  Energy  capitalized  or  expensed  $103  million,  $110  million  and $101  million  associated  with  these  contracts  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively.\n\nCommitted minimum payments under these obligations are $15 million in 2022.\n\nGuarantees  and  Bond  Indemnifications -Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries  provide  guarantees  and  bond  indemnities,  which  guarantee payment or performance. Xcel Energy Inc.'s exposure is based upon the net  liability  under  the  specified  agreements  or  transactions.  Most  of  the guarantees  and  bond  indemnities  issued  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries have a stated maximum amount.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries had no assets held as collateral related to their guarantees, bond indemnities and indemnification agreements. Guarantees and bond indemnities issued and outstanding for Xcel Energy were $60 million and $62 million at Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively.\n\nOther  Indemnification  Agreements -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries provide indemnifications through various contracts. These are primarily indemnifications against adverse litigation outcomes in connection with underwriting agreements, as well as breaches of representations and warranties,  including  corporate  existence,  transaction  authorization  and income tax matters with respect to assets sold. Xcel Energy Inc.'s and its subsidiaries' obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of duration and amount. Maximum future payments under these indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated as the dollar amounts are often not explicitly stated.\n\n## 13.

Segment Information\n\nXcel  Energy  evaluates  performance  by  each  utility  subsidiary  based  on profit or loss generated from the product or service provided, including the regulated electric utility operating results of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS, as well as the regulated natural gas utility operating  results  of  NSP-Minnesota,  NSP-Wisconsin  and  PSCo.  These segments  are  managed  separately  because  the  revenue  streams  are dependent  upon  regulated  rate  recovery,  which  is  separately  determined for each segment.\n\nXcel Energy has the following reportable segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulated  Electric -  The  regulated  electric  utility segment generates, transmits and distributes electricity in Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Michigan,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Colorado,  Texas and New Mexico. In addition, this segment includes sales for resale and provides wholesale transmission service to various entities in the United  States.  The  regulated  electric  utility  segment  also  includes wholesale commodity and trading operations.\n- \u00b7 Regulated Natural Gas - The regulated natural gas utility segment transports,  stores  and  distributes  natural  gas  primarily  in  portions  of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Michigan and Colorado.\n\nXcel  Energy  also  presents  All  Other,  which  includes  operating  segments with  revenues  below  the  necessary  quantitative  thresholds.  Those operating  segments  primarily  include  steam  revenue,  appliance  repair services,  non-utility  real  estate  activities,  revenues  associated  with processing  solid  waste  into  refuse-derived  fuel,  investments  in  rental housing  projects  that  qualify  for  low-income  housing  tax  credits  and  the operations of MEC until July 2020.\n\nXcel  Energy  had  equity  method  investments  of  $208  million  and $165 million  as  of  Dec.  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  included  in  the natural gas utility and all other segments.\n\nAsset and capital expenditure information is not provided for Xcel Energy's reportable segments. As an integrated electric and natural gas utility, Xcel Energy  operates  significant  assets  that  are  not  dedicated  to  a  specific business segment. Reporting assets and capital expenditures by business segment  would  require  arbitrary  and  potentially  misleading  allocations, which may not necessarily reflect the assets that would be required for the operation of the business segments on a stand-alone basis.\n\nCertain costs, such as common depreciation, common O&M expenses and interest  expense  are  allocated  based  on  cost  causation  allocators  across each segment. In addition, a general allocator is used for certain general and  administrative  expenses,  including  office  supplies,  rent,  property insurance and general advertising.\n\nXcel Energy's segment information:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                | 2021      | 2020      | 2019      |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Regulated Electric                   |           |           |           |\n| Operating revenues - external        | $  11,205 | $  9,802  | $  9,575  |\n| Intersegment revenue                 | 2         | 2         | 1         |\n| Total revenues                       | $  11,207 | $  9,804  | $  9,576  |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 1,855     | 1,673     | 1,535     |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 568       | 534       | 500       |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense         | (96)      | 1         | 125       |\n| Net income                           | 1,478     | 1,407     | 1,288     |\n| Regulated Natural Gas                |           |           |           |\n| Operating revenues - external        | $  2,132  | $  1,636  | $  1,868  |\n| Intersegment revenue                 | 2         | 1         | 2         |\n| Total revenues                       | $  2,134  | $  1,637  | $  1,870  |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 254       | 252       | 219       |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 75        | 71        | 69        |\n| Income tax expense                   | 54        | 17        | 48        |\n| Net income                           | 231       | 190       | 195       |\n| All Other                            |           |           |           |\n| Total revenues                       | $  94     | $  88     | $  86     |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 12        | 23        | 11        |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 173       | 193       | 167       |\n| Income tax benefit                   | (28)      | (24)      | (45)      |\n| Net loss                             | (112)     | (124)     | (111)     |\n| Consolidated Total                   |           |           |           |\n| Total revenues                       | $  13,435 | $  11,529 | $  11,532 |\n| Reconciling eliminations             | (4)       | (3)       | (3)       |\n| Total operating revenues             | $  13,431 | $  11,526 | $  11,529 |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 2,121     | 1,948     | 1,765     |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 816       | 798       | 736       |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense         | (70)      | (6)       | 128       |\n| Net income                           | 1,597     | 1,473     | 1,372     |\n\n## ITEM 9 - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nXcel  Energy  maintains  a  set  of  disclosure  controls  and  procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it  files  or  submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures ensure  that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  is  accumulated  and communicated  to  management,  including  the  CEO  and  CFO,  allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure.",

 The  condensed  financial  information  of  Xcel Energy Inc. is presented to comply with Rule 12-04 of Regulation S-X. Xcel Energy  Inc.'s  investments  in  subsidiaries  are  presented  under  the  equity method  of  accounting.  Under  this  method,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of subsidiaries  are  not  consolidated.  The  investments  in  net  assets  of  the subsidiaries  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheets.  The  income  from operations of the subsidiaries is reported on a net basis as equity in income of subsidiaries.\n\nAs  a  holding  company  with  no  business  operations,  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s assets consist primarily of investments in its utility subsidiaries. Xcel Energy Inc.'s  material  cash  inflows  are  only  from  dividends  and  other  payments received from its utility subsidiaries and the proceeds raised from the sale of  debt  and equity securities. The ability of its utility subsidiaries to make dividend  and  other  payments  is  subject  to  the  availability  of  funds  after taking into account their respective funding requirements, the terms of their respective  indebtedness,  the  regulations  of  the  FERC  under  the  Federal Power  Act,  and  applicable  state  laws.  Management  does  not  expect maintaining  these  requirements  to  have  an  impact  on  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future. Each of its utility subsidiaries, however, is legally distinct and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to Xcel Energy Inc.",

As  of  Dec.  31,  2021  and  2020, Xcel  Energy  Inc.  had  no  assets  held  as  collateral  related  to  guarantees, bond indemnities and indemnification agreements.\n\nGuarantees and bond indemnities issued and outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2021:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                                                 | Guarantor         | Guarantee Amount   | Current Exposure   | Triggering Event   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Guarantee of loan for  Hiawatha Collegiate High  School  (a)                                          | Xcel Energy  Inc. | $  1               | -                  | (c)                |\n| Guarantee performance and  payment of surety bonds for  Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility  subsidiaries  (b) | Xcel Energy  Inc. | 59                 | (e)                | (d)                |\n\n## Indemnification Agreements\n\nXcel Energy Inc. provides indemnifications through contracts entered into in the  normal  course  of  business.  Indemnifications  are  primarily  against adverse  litigation  outcomes  in  connection  with  underwriting  agreements, breaches of representations and warranties, including corporate existence, transaction authorization and certain income tax matters. Obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of duration or amount. Maximum future  payments  under  these  indemnifications  cannot  be  reasonably estimated as the dollar amounts are often not explicitly stated.\n\nRelated  Party  Transactions -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  presents  related  party receivables  net  of  payables.

The  utility  money  pool  allows  for  short-term investments in and borrowings between the utility subsidiaries. Xcel Energy Inc.  may  make  investments  in  the  utility  subsidiaries  at  market-based interest  rates;  however,  the  money  pool  arrangement  does  not  allow  the utility subsidiaries to make investments in Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nMoney pool lending for Xcel Energy Inc.:\n\n| (Amounts in Millions, Except Interest Rates)              | Three Months Ended  Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Loan outstanding at period end                            | $  -
