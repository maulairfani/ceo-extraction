The importance of that role has rarely been clearer than in recent weeks - a period marked by worldwide energy shortages, record prices and volatility. The causes are complex, but they include the disruptive legacy of the pandemic and Russia's act of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time as maintaining secure supplies, bp must pursue its emissions targets and aims, while continuing to increase its supply of energy from low carbon sources.\n\nI believe bp's strategy gets the balance right. But recent events have demonstrated why, alongside pursuing its strategy, bp must have the agility necessary to make adjustments. Following Russia's attack on Ukraine, the bp board undertook a thorough review of bp's involvement with Rosneft in Russia. After careful consideration, the board concluded that bp's continuing involvement would be inconsistent with our business and strategy. As we said at the time, the board believes that these decisions are in the best longterm interests of all our shareholders.\n\nImportantly, our decision to end bp's involvement with Rosneft in Russia did not mean that any changes to our strategy, financial frame or shareholder distributions guidance were required. We remain confident that the impact of this decision can be accommodated within the plans we have laid out and refined over the past two years.\n\nMeanwhile, global action on climate remains vitally important. Despite progress at last year's COP26 in Glasgow, the world remains on an unsustainable path and has yet to move decisively towards a net zero society. Doing so will require building a global energy system capable of delivering affordable, secure and increasingly clean energy, and with energy demand and supply moving in tandem. Building such a system will require collaboration, within the right policy framework, between business, government, academia and civil society.\n\nAchieving all of that will be complex. But that complexity is precisely why purposeful companies need to get involved. Climate change can be addressed more forcefully if the world is able to draw upon high-performing businesses' capacity to innovate, allocate capital, scale technology and drive efficiency.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic progress - performing while transforming\n\nAs we have said before, the energy transition will be a multi-decade process. It is unlikely always to proceed smoothly and may involve periods of turbulence for reasons that are outside of bp's control. But throughout the transition, our goal will be to maintain the high performance and steady progress we have shown since our transformation journey began in 2020.\n\nIndeed, in 2021 that progress allowed the company to further reduce debt, increase its dividend, and begin share buybacks - all in accordance with a considered financial frame. Most important of all is that safety performance improves, and bp's safety record is showing improvements. We continue the constant pursuit of our goal of no accidents, no harm to people, no damage to the environment.\n\n## Confidence in bp's team\n\nEvery one of bp's people deserves credit for the achievements of 2021, especially given the disruption imposed by the pandemic. On behalf of the board, I offer them all my sincere thanks.\n\nThe confidence I have in bp's people extends fully to its leadership. For what is still a relatively new team, it has achieved a lot - steadily leading bp through a period of volatility and change. I particularly thank Bernard for his commitment to bp and for his leadership.\n\n## Adjusted aims\n\nConfident in bp's strategy, performance and people, the board concluded in February 2022 that bp should accelerate its net zero ambition. I hope that these changes - set out in detail on page 51 - demonstrate that in a fast-moving, complex environment, bp is evolving in a responsive, dynamic way. And I am pleased that bp intends to provide shareholders with the opportunity of an advisory vote on its net zero ambition at its 2022 AGM.\n\n## Purposeful engagement\n\nEven ahead of that opportunity, we are pleased that shareholders increasingly express their support for the transition that bp is making - recognizing that the company is able to meet both the risks and the opportunities that the energy transition presents.\n\nIn fact, the board's engagement across all of bp's stakeholders is deeper and more extensive than ever before, whether through drop-in sessions with bp teams, consultation with governments, or meetings with shareholders.\n\nDuring these conversations, we often hear suggestions for how we can improve. I am always grateful for those suggestions; after all, bp began this transformation journey after listening to friends and critics who told us that bp needed to change. I am glad we listened. We will continue to do so as your constructive criticism makes bp better.\n\n## My thanks\n\nIn our complex world, bp's guiding light remains its purpose - reimagining energy for people and our planet. To succeed, we must continue to win and grow the trust of our stakeholders, including our shareholders.\n\nI am deeply grateful to everyone who has stood by bp - and equally grateful to the many new shareholders who have joined us on the journey. The past two years have shown that it won't always be easy, but I am confident that, with your support, bp will continue performing while transforming. The energy transition has already given bp a huge opportunity. Now, we are on our way. Thank you for your support.\n\nHelge Lund Chair 18 March 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Dear shareholders,\n\nThe desperate situation in Ukraine is dominating our thoughts at bp as I write to you. Our hearts go out to everyone affected, especially the people of Ukraine and in the wider region.\n\nAs Helge sets out in his letter, we already announced we will exit our involvement with Rosneft in Russia. Our ongoing priority continues to  be our employees and their families in Russia. Additionally we are supporting the humanitarian efforts in the region - for example, leveraging our businesses in neighbouring countries, leveraging our global employees' desire to help, as well as donations to charities.\n\nLike Helge, I am absolutely convinced that the decisions we have taken are in the best long-term interests of shareholders - and consistent with who we are as a company.\n\n## Strengthening and improving\n\nAgainst that backdrop - bp's finances are strong and resilient. We are making substantial progress on our strategy to pivot from an international oil company to an integrated energy company. To repeat words that you may have heard me use before, we are performing while transforming - delivering for you today while preparing bp for tomorrow.\n\nThe bedrock, as always, has been safe and reliable operations, day-in, day-out. Overall, we saw improvements in safety during 2021 across several areas. Tragically though, we lost a colleague in a fatal accident at our Castell\u00f3n refinery in Spain, and a cyclist in the UK died in an accident with one of our contractors' road tankers. We will remain constantly focused on eliminating accidents, particularly those that take or change lives - nothing is more important.\n\nWith this foundation we are building a track record of delivery. We met our target of $2.5 billion of cash cost \uf0ab savings (compared with 2019), reduced our net debt a \uf0ab by over $8 billion, and grew returns (ROACE) b \uf0ab to 13.3%. Our operating cash flow \uf0ab for the year was $23.6 billion and our underlying RC profit \uf0ab was $12.8 billion.\n\nThis performance enabled the board, in line with our disciplined financial frame, to make a number of decisions in relation to distributions. First, an increase of 4% to the dividend in the second quarter. Second, to return $4.15 billion to you through share buybacks from 2021 surplus cash flow \uf0ab . And third, an expectation that we can deliver buybacks of around $4 billion a year and will have the capacity to increase the dividend per ordinary share by 4% each year through to 2025\n\n- - based on our current forecasts at an oil price of around $60 and subject to the board's discretion.\n\n## Progressing our strategy\n\nI want to pay tribute to the bp team, not just for the strong performance delivered in 2021, but also the strong progress they have achieved across each of the three pillars of our strategy: resilient hydrocarbons, convenience and mobility, and low carbon energy.\n\n- \u00b7 Resilient hydrocarbons - we started up seven major projects \uf0ab in the year. These are part of a programme of 35 projects initiated in 2016, completed on schedule and, on average, around 15% under budget. We will continue to high-grade our portfolio with four more start-ups planned in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Convenience and mobility - we have grown margin share from convenience and electrification \uf0ab from 25% to 29% since 2019 c - demonstrating the strength of our customer offers; and we increased the number of EV charge points \uf0ab to over 13,000, installing 115 charging points a week at the end of 2021. We now aim to grow our EV charge points to more than 100,000 globally by 2030, up from our previous aim of 70,000.\n- \u00b7 Low carbon energy - our renewables pipeline \uf0ab quadrupled to over 23GW since the start of 2020, and now includes three offshore wind projects in two of the world's best regions. We have also built a portfolio of options in hydrogen.\n\nYou will find more information on our strategic progress throughout this report, including how our trading and shipping and regions, cities and solutions teams are helping to knit together integrated energy solutions for our customers.\n\n## Integration in action\n\nNowhere better illustrates the potential of an integrated energy company than our home market of the UK, where in the next few years we anticipate spending \u00a32 for every \u00a31 of profit we make. We plan to continue to invest in the North Sea, to produce much-needed oil and gas while lowering emissions through efficiencies, working to eliminate routine flaring and electrification of our operations. We're building a new renewables business with large-scale offshore wind projects in the Irish Sea and off the coast of Scotland. As these businesses grow, they can not only power millions of homes but also our growing network of electric vehicle chargers - an increasingly important part of our retail network, where customers come to fuel their vehicles as well as enjoy the growing number of M&S convenience stores on our forecourts.\n\nAnd looking further ahead, we are leading the industrial regeneration of the north-east of England. Here we have plans for a gas-fired power station connected with a carbon capture and storage system, which will safely lock away the vast majority of the CO 2 emissions. And at the same time - we are laying the foundations for a world-class hydrogen sector for the UK.\n\n## Opportunity and resilience\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties in a decadeslong energy transition, we developed bp's strategy for both responsiveness and resilience - responsiveness to opportunities and resilience to volatility.\n\nIn terms of opportunity - we see great potential for our company in five transition growth engines - bioenergy, convenience, electric vehicle charging, renewables and hydrogen. In each of these areas, our skills, networks, assets and brand give us real competitive advantage. There are all in growth sectors where the potential for returns is strong.\n\nIn terms of uncertainty, our strategy is designed to accommodate a range of scenarios for the energy transition. This also  gives us confidence that it is resilient to the heightened volatility in energy markets arising from the conflict in Ukraine. Exiting from bp's shareholding in Rosneft will result in some material non-cash charges in our financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Importantly, this does not mean any changes to our strategy or our financial frame, as detailed elsewhere in this report.\n\nIn 2020 we set a new direction for the company, with our new purpose, ambition and strategy. That is now done. In 2021 we reorganized the company from top to bottom through the most wide-ranging restructuring in bp's history. That is also done. We are now focused on one thing and one thing only - the safe delivery of our strategy. Delivering for you, our shareholders, today. Delivering the energy the world needs, today. All while transforming bp for tomorrow.\n\nThank you for your continued support for and belief in bp - especially through these unprecedented times of challenge and change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bernard Looney\n\nChief executive officer 18 March 2022\n\n- a Nearest equivalent GAAP measure is finance debt.

This is creating challenges and opportunities for our industry and influencing the way we operate. We monitor global trends closely, exploring and tracking the changes shaping our future.\n\n## Global economy\n\nAfter a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, global real GDP has rebounded and reached its pre-pandemic peak (of the fourth quarter of 2019) in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe global economy grew by an estimated 5.9% in 2021, its strongest post-recession pace in 80 years. However, the recovery was uneven amid unequal COVID-19 vaccine access and differences in policy support across the globe.\n\nGrowth in developed economies was 5.0% in 2021, driven by a strong recovery in the US, and GDP in emerging markets grew by 6.5%, driven by China. b\n\n## Oil\n\nThe oil market continued its rebalancing process in 2021. Oil demand rebounded with global oil consumption c increasing by 5.5mmb/d to 96.4mmb/d for the year (+6.0%) on the back of the economic recovery, supported by the increasing vaccination roll-out and gradual lifting of public health measures.\n\nOn the supply side, continued active supply management by OPEC+ countries also helped accelerate the rebalancing process, with global oil production d increasing by 1.5mmb/d to 95.3mmb/d.\n\nDated Brent \uf0ab prices averaged $70.91/bbl in 2021 - a 69% increase from 2020 levels d .\n\nPrices rose consistently during 2021, reaching a peak of $86/bbl in late October on the back of a positive macroeconomic outlook, which supported a strong rebound in oil demand. Other factors such as supply disruptions and OPEC+ supply restraint added further upside pressure on prices.\n\nUrals prices in north-west Europe (Rotterdam) averaged $68.65/bbl in 2021, up from $41.71/bbl in 2020 e .\n\n## Natural gas\n\nThe global economic recovery supported natural gas demand in 2021, and prices in all three key gas regions rebounded strongly. A series of compounding factors helped to push prices up, with record, unprecedented pricing levels seen in many regions.\n\nHenry Hub prices increased to $3.9/ mmBtu in 2021 from $2/mmBtu in 2020 f .\n\nUS LNG exports increased, driving demand for feedgas into LNG. Capital discipline constraints restrained gas production growth, and coal retirements limited gas-to-coal switching in the power sector, together reducing the gas market's flexibility to respond to higher prices.\n\nThe UK National Balancing Point \uf0ab hub price also rose significantly from 25 pence per therm ($3.2/mmBtu) in 2020, up to 116 pence per therm ($15.8/mmBtu) in 2021 g , due to exceptionally tight market conditions. An extended heating season in the first half of the year drove storage stocks well below historical average levels. Through the summer, strong competition for LNG supply as well as constraints from Russian pipeline gas supplies tightened the market and prevented stocks from being replenished. Thus, the winter heating season started with stocks at historical lows and prices increased to record levels to reflect significant market risk. Elevated coal and carbon prices further supported European gas prices in 2021.\n\nAsian LNG spot prices increased from $4.39/ mmBtu in 2020 to $18.6/mmBtu in 2021 amid a very tight LNG market, with prices rising to $56/mmBtu at their highest point h . China was the principal driver of LNG demand growth, as the country overtook Japan as the world's largest LNG importer. Strong LNG demand in South America, multiple LNG supply outages, and tight LNG shipping market conditions at times, compounded the market's tightness to drive higher prices.\n\n## Macroeconomic outlook March 2022\n\nThe energy markets are being impacted by the military action in Ukraine, which is adding significant upside pressure to prices. There remains, at this point in time, uncertainty, but price volatility is likely. On the macroeconomic side this is likely to have significant economic and financial consequences for the region and potentially globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nyear-on-year increase in global oil consumption in 2021\n\n6\u00b70%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nestimated increase in global gas demand in 2021 a\n\n4\n\n7%\n\n\u00b7",

Interest in CCS has been bolstered by the need to abate process emissions from heavy industries such as cement and steel manufacture, together with a growing recognition of the need for negative emissions to meet Paris climate goals.\n\n- i The RMM may not be representative of the margin achieved by bp in any period because of bp's particular refinery configurations and crude and product slates.

        "page_content": "## Scenarios for strategic decision making\n\nWe have been using scenarios at bp to inform strategy, manage risk and improve decision-making for many years.\n\nThe scenarios we used to inform our ambition and strategy, which we set out in 2020, were based on a collaborative approach between our economists, strategists and our senior management team and board.\n\nSome scenarios start from today and project forward over a timeframe in which the current structure of the energy system helps to inform the pace and nature of the transition path. Other scenarios start in the future, breaking free from the inherent inertia in the energy system (and potentially our thinking), and look back to the present from that new perspective.\n\nIn thinking about appropriate scenarios to inform our strategy, we used both approaches.\n\nThe scenarios chosen to explore the range of uncertainty surrounding the future of the global energy system span a broad range of energy transition paths. They consider the possible implications of different judgements and assumptions and so help to design a strategy which is resilient to the wide range of uncertainty we face.\n\nBy considering various time horizons, we can identify key milestones or signposts which might emerge over the next five, 10 or 30 years and inform our view of the key sources of uncertainty affecting the global energy system.\n\nWe actively monitor for changes in the external environment, and refresh or review our scenarios as needed in response to these signals, as we have done with our New Momentum scenario.\n\n## How we create scenarios\n\nWe quantify a range of scenarios in the bp Energy Outlook 2022 using our global energy modelling system. This comprises a suite of models developed over the past 10 years to help us understand supply and demand dynamics of the global energy system as well as production in intermediate sectors.\n\nThe modelling framework uses historical data based on the bp Statistical Review of World Energy , the IEA and a range of other data sets.\n\nEach scenario is determined by a set of key assumptions including population and economic growth, pace of technological change, resource constraints and government policies. These are informed by expert views from external organizations including United Nations, Oxford Economics, Rystad Energy and a proprietary integrated assessment model.\n\nPrices are used to balance supply and demand. The modelling techniques used vary by sector and include a combination of econometric modelling, least-cost optimization, adoption curves and consumer choice modelling.\n\nFor the bp Energy Outlook 2022 , the outputs have been expanded to capture 16 regions and 15 end-use sectors; in addition process emissions from key industrial sectors are included, for the first time.\n\nIn developing the scenarios, we benchmark our views against scenarios from external organizations including the IEA's World Energy Outlook , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and S&P Global's Energy and Climate Scenarios .\n\n## How scenarios inform our strategy\n\nThe use of scenarios described in the bp Energy Outlook 2022 and from other organizations aids our understanding of the energy transition and the global energy system. This helps us to think about different outcomes and how they might impact our strategy.\n\nThe use of a broad range of scenarios to inform our strategy supports our efforts to make it robust and resilient to the range of uncertainty we face. Given that, we believe that it is neither useful nor sensible to try to identify one scenario as being more or less likely than another.\n\n## How we use scenarios in resilience analysis\n\nFor the purposes of testing the resilience of our strategy to the range of uncertainty in the energy transition we have used scenarios drawn from the soon-to-be published World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 'Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach for Companies in the Energy System'. By using standard variables from this Scenario Catalogue we believe it will help enable comparability and consistency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on our resilience analysis and the outcome of that work, see page 55",

However, bp remains confident in the flexibility and resilience of its financial frame, underpinned by an average 2021-25 cash balance point of around $40 per barrel. This includes reaffirming the guidance regarding its financial frame out to 2025 that was given with its 2021 full-year results in February 2022.\n\n## #1 Resilient dividend\n\nA resilient dividend is our first priority within our financial frame. Reflecting the underlying performance of the business, an improving outlook for the environment, confidence in our balance sheet and commencement of the share buyback programme, the board announced a 4% increase in the second quarter 2021 dividend to 5.46 cents per ordinary share. This increase is accommodated within a 2021-25 average cash balance point \uf0ab of around $40 per barrel Brent, $11 per barrel RMM \uf0ab and $3 per mmBtu Henry Hub (all 2020 $ real).\n\nBased on our current forecasts, at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board's discretion each quarter, we expect to have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4%, through 2025.\n\n## #2 Strong investment grade credit rating\n\nFor the full year 2021 we reduced finance debt by $11.5 billion and net debt \uf0ab by $8.3 billion. During the first quarter of 2021 we reached our target of reducing net debt to below $35 billion around one year earlier than expected, with net debt reaching $30.6 billion at year end.\n\nWe intend to allocate 40% of 2022 surplus cash flow to further strengthen the balance sheet.\n\n## Disciplined investment allocation\n\nWe are focused on the disciplined allocation of capital to deliver on our strategic objectives. In 2021 capital expenditure was $12.8 billion. We expect capital expenditure to be in a range of $14-15 billion in 2022 and $14-16 billion per annum between 2023-25.\n\nInvestment is allocated across our businesses based on a set of criteria that balances strategic alignment, stringent hurdle rates, volatility, integration value, sustainability and risk.",

The Glasgow Climate Pact agreed by the Parties at COP26 in November 2021 reaffirmed the temperature goal set out in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe believe the world is on an unsustainable path - the carbon budget is running out and needs to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe believe there are a range of global pathways to achieve the Paris goals, with differing implications for regions, industries and sectors, so business strategies need to be flexible and resilient to this uncertainty.\n\nbp's strategy is informed by all these considerations. It is designed to create long-term value for shareholders, while enabling delivery of our net zero ambition - to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero. It is designed to be resilient to the uncertainty of the energy transition across many different potential pathways, including various Paris-consistent pathways.\n\nIn the 2020 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F we set out, based on three key principles, why the board considers our strategy to be consistent with the Paris goals.\n\nHere we set out, on the same three grounds, why the board continues to consider this to be the case, and why our progress over the last year has reinforced our confidence in this belief.\n\n## 1. Informed by Paris-consistent energy transition scenarios\n\nWe use scenarios described in the bp Energy Outlook and from other organizations to inform our core beliefs about the energy transition.\n\nWe believe that it is neither useful nor sensible to try to identify one scenario as being more or less likely than another, and therefore considering a broad range of scenarios from multiple sources to develop and test our strategic thinking helps to increase our confidence in the robustness and resilience of our strategy to the range of uncertainty we face.\n\nWe are confident that our approach is sciencebased. We see the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the most authoritative source of information on the evolving science of climate change and we use it and other sources to inform our strategy. The IPCC highlights that there are a range of global pathways by which the world can meet the Paris goals, with differing implications for regions, industry sectors and sources of energy.\n\n## In the last year\u2026\n\nThe bp Energy Outlook 2022 has been updated to reflect the significant developments in the pace and nature of the energy transition. It includes two Paris-consistent scenarios that we use to inform the company's strategy, specifically the Accelerated and Net Zero scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See Energy Outlook, page 10 and bp.com/energyoutlook\n\n## 2. Strategic resilience\n\nWe believe our strategy positions bp for success and resilience in a Paris-consistent world - a world that is progressing on one of the many global trajectories considered to be Paris consistent, and ultimately meets the Paris goals.\n\nIn setting the strategy, the board and management referred to a range of scenarios including those set out in the bp Energy Outlook 2022.\n\nThe strategy diversifies bp's portfolio and business interests, reducing the risk that challenges facing a single business area might adversely affect bp's strategic resilience. In addition, within the inevitable constraints associated with factors such as long-term capital investments, contractual commitments and organizational capabilities at any given time, part of the company's ability to maintain its strategic resilience rests on the governance by which the strategy can be kept under review as necessary in light of new information and changes in circumstances.\n\nIn our climate-related financial disclosures on page 55 we describe how we have conducted a scenario analysis to test our view of the resilience of our strategy to different climate-related scenarios, including those that are classified by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to be consistent with well below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C outcomes.\n\nAs we explain on page 61, for the purposes of the scenario analysis, the resilience of our strategy to climate-related transition risks and opportunities was considered through three lenses - our ability to continue to (i) deliver shareholder value, (ii) maintain a strong balance sheet and (iii) invest in the energy transition under a range of possible transition pathways, including those that are Paris-consistent. The scenario analysis and resilience test were designed to identify the most relevant transition risk variables for each in-scope business area, and the most extreme range in 2030 for each of those variables across all of the scenarios included in the WBCSD Catalogue as of January 2022.\n\nOil price was the only such variable we considered to have the potential to adversely affect the resilience of our strategy in the timeframe of the analysis. We therefore conducted a quantified test of the resilience of our strategy against the most extreme downside of that range for the oil price from 2023-2030.\n\nWhile the results of any such analysis must be treated with caution - because each is necessarily dependent on many assumptions and methodological choices, and each has its own limitations - overall, this resilience test reinforced our confidence in the resilience of our strategy to a wide range of ways in which the energy system could evolve throughout this decade, including in scenarios consistent with limiting temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThe analysis also reinforced our recognition that in a sustained very low oil price environment mitigating actions may be necessary, while highlighting that there is no clear-cut correspondence between oil price and the temperature goal with which a scenario is associated. Notably, while the lowest oil price was associated with a 1.5\u00b0C scenario, in four of the six 1.5\u00b0C scenarios we used - and in four of the six 2\u00b0C scenarios used - the oil price in 2030 was found to be higher than bp's own oil price planning assumption for 2030.\n\n## In the last year\u2026\n\nFor the purposes of the scenario analysis exercise referred to above, we used scenarios from the soon-to-be published WBCSD 'Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach for Companies in the Energy System', developed at the request of, and with support from, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Our approach to this scenario analysis, and the outputs from it, are discussed in detail in our TCFD Strategy disclosures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See Climate-related financial disclosures, page 55\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. Contributes to net zero\n\nWe believe that our strategy enables bp to make a positive contribution to the world achieving net zero GHG emissions and meeting the Paris temperature goals - outcomes which we believe to be in the best interests of bp as well as beneficial to society generally. We see huge opportunity in the energy transition - the transformation of the energy system that we believe to be a necessary feature of the world's efforts to meet the Paris goals.\n\nThere are many different ways in which a company at the heart of the energy sector can make a meaningful contribution to the world getting to net zero. These include: policy advocacy and seeking to use the company's influence with trade associations who also conduct climate-related policy advocacy, low carbon collaboration and support for others, such as cities and companies, in their own\n\ndecarbonization efforts, and investments in low carbon and technology development. bp seeks to advance these areas through our aims in support of our net zero ambition, including aims 6-10 which are focused on activities which can help the world get to net zero, see page 51.\n\nAnd as we pursue our strategy, our diversification and the growth of our low carbon businesses may also contribute to helping the world get to net zero. For example, in markets where we plan to scale our electric vehicle (EV) charging networks, this may contribute to reducing the 'range anxiety' which is one factor holding people back from purchasing electric vehicles.\n\nSome ways of contributing are more readily measured by quantitative metrics than others - but all can be important, whether or not they translate into GHG reductions for the company.\n\nTo illustrate this, in terms of low carbon investment, by 2030 we aim to increase our amount of developed renewables to final investment decision to 50GW, as part of our increased capital expenditure on low carbon businesses.\n\nThis aim supports the Paris goals by increasing the low carbon options available to energy consumers. However, it does not reduce our Scope 1, 2 or 3 emissions. And it may not result in a decrease in the overall intensity of bp's marketed products, because that is dependent on the extent to which we - rather than another party such as a buyer of the developed project - market the resulting renewable power, which\n\nis a commercial consideration. Where we do not sell that power, our development of the renewables is effectively 'invisible' in terms of our GHG metrics.\n\nUnder aim 6 we aim to more actively advocate for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing. Helping policymakers to design and put in place low carbon policies can help deliver our strategy and capitalize on the huge opportunities associated with achieving the Paris goals.\n\nWell-designed low carbon policies can advance the decarbonization of a whole economy something potentially of far greater impact than anything a single company can achieve through its own portfolio.\n\n## In the last year\u2026\n\nOur progress against our strategy and growing confidence in business opportunities associated with net zero value chains meant that in February 2022 we were able to announce some changes to our net zero aims 1 and 3 as part of an update on our strategic progress. For more information see page 51. This creates a package of net zero carbon aims across our operations, production and sales. These announcements also reinforce our belief that our strategy enables us to make a positive contribution to meeting the Paris goals.\n\nWe have also actively advocated for policy to support net zero, for some examples of this work, see page 52.\n\n## Responding to increased shareholder interest on Paris consistency\n\nIn 2019 the board recommended that shareholders support a special resolution requisitioned by Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) on climate change disclosures. The CA100+ resolution passed with more than 99% of the vote. This is the third year we have included responses throughout the annual report. We have adopted a similar approach to that taken in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 .\n\nThe CA100+ resolution, which includes safeguards such as protections for commercially confidential and competitively sensitive information, is on page 377. Key terms related to this resolution response are indicated with \uf0ab and defined in the glossary on page 377. These should be reviewed with the following information.\n\n| Element of the CA100+ resolution                                                                                                           | Related content                                                                              | Where       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Strategy that the board considers in good faith to be consistent  with the Paris goals.                                                    | Our strategy and business model  Pursuing a strategy that is consistent with the Paris goals | 12 30       |\n| How bp evaluates each new material capex investment \uf0ab  for consistency  with the Paris goals and other outcomes relevant to bp strategy.   | Our investment process                                                                       | 32          |\n| Disclosure of bp's principal metrics and relevant targets or goals over  the short, medium and long term, consistent with the Paris goals. | Key performance indicators                                                                   | 24          |\n|                                                                                                                                            | Sustainability: net zero targets and aims See 'TCFD metrics and targets' for an overview     | 51 66       |\n| Anticipated levels of investment in:  (i) Oil and gas resources and reserves.

        "page_content": "## Our investment process\n\n## How we use price assumptions\n\nOur price assumptions are determined for use in our investment appraisal processes. They are also used to inform decisions about internal planning and the value-in-use impairment testing of assets for financial reporting.\n\n## The role of price assumptions\n\nAs part of our strategy development, we review our portfolio and capital development plans. This work informs our view of the price environment and its balanced investment criteria. Together these create a framework that seeks to ensure investments align with our strategy and add shareholder value.\n\nWe attach increasing weight to the possibility that the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system could accelerate. While we increased our price assumption for Brent oil out to 2030 in the second quarter of 2021 to reflect near-term supply constraints, we also revised down our longterm Brent oil price assumptions to 2050.\n\nOver the next few years we expect to see continued periods of market volatility as demand recovers against a backdrop of reduced levels of investment. However the role of long-term price assumptions is to look through this near-term volatility and help us to confirm the resilience we expect of our future projects to the longer-term trends affecting our industry.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021 our investment appraisal long-term price assumptions were reviewed. For Brent oil and Henry Hub gas, they average around $56/bbl and $2.9/ mmBtu (2020 $ real) respectively, from 2022 to 2050, and we consider these long-term price assumptions to be in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the Paris goals. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario.\n\nWhere applicable, we also continue to use carbon prices rising to $100/tCO 2 e in 2030 and $250/tCO 2 e by 2050 (2020 $ real) for operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in certain investment cases, as explained on page 34.\n\n## Key investment appraisal assumptions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020 $ real\n\n|                            |   2022 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)          |     60 |     60 |     60 |     55 |  45    |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)    |      3 |      3 |      3 |      3 |   2.75 |\n| Refining marker margin a \uf0ab |     11 |     12 |     12 |     10 |  10    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Carbon price (US$/tCO e) T\n\n2 2020 $ real\n\n|   2022 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|     50 |     50 |    100 |    200 |    250 |\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nOur best estimate of future prices for use in value-in-use impairment testing continues to be based on the annual review of investment appraisal price assumptions, with quarterly review of near-term prices to confirm that the assumptions appropriately reflect any changes to expectations due to short-term market trends.\n\nAs a result of the revision made in the second quarter of 2021 to oil and gas price assumptions used for investment appraisal, we also revised the price assumptions we use in value-in-use impairment testing. Other than the 2022\n\nBrent and Henry Hub price assumptions, which are $70/bbl and $4.00/mmBtu (both 2020 $ real) respectively, for value-in-use impairment testing, these two price sets remain aligned, except that potential future emissions costs that could be borne by bp are included in investment appraisals as bp costs, generally without assuming incremental revenue, in order to incentivize engineering solutions to mitigate carbon emissions on projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment process price assumptions\n\nAll investments are evaluated against our long-term price assumptions across a range of alternative prices (central, upper and lower) for oil, natural gas and refining margins. In addition, all investment cases with anticipated annual GHG emissions (bp net basis) from operations above 20,000 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent must estimate those anticipated GHG emissions and include an associated carbon price in the investment economics.\n\nAll price assumptions place some weight on scenarios in which the transition to a low carbon energy system is sufficiently rapid to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as scenarios in which the transition is not, or may not be, sufficiently rapid. They also place some weight on a range of other factors, which can drive prices, and which are not related to the Paris goals.\n\nThese price ranges do not link to specific scenarios or outcomes, but instead try to capture the range of different possibilities surrounding the future path of the global energy system. The nature of the uncertainty means that these price ranges inevitably reflect considerable judgement. The ranges are reviewed and updated on an annual basis as our understanding and judgement about the energy transition evolves.\n\nIn addition to consideration of a range of price assumptions, investment cases are asked to assess the impact of alternative assumptions covering a range of other variables related to the economics of the investment, such as cost, resource, policy changes and schedule, to highlight the robustness of investment cases to a range of other factors.\n\nFor the treatment of emission cost assumptions in value-in-use impairment testing, see Financial statements Note 1\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Investment in non-oil and gas\n\nOur aim 5 is to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and gas activities. Over time, as investment goes up in low and no carbon, we see it going down in oil and gas.\n\nAs we continue towards our net zero ambition, we target increasing our low carbon investment \uf0ab to $3-4 billion per year in 2025, and aim to increase it to at least $5 billion per year in 2030.\n\nIn 2021, our investment in low carbon \uf0ab increased from around $750 million in 2020 to nearly $2.2 billion, the majority of which is related to investments in offshore wind, electric vehicle charging and solar.\n\nOffshore wind: we completed the formation of a 50:50 strategic US offshore wind partnership with Equinor to jointly develop up to 4.4GW of capacity in two major lease areas off the US east coast through projects Empire Wind and Beacon. In the UK, bp and 50:50 partner EnBW were jointly selected as the preferred bidder for two 60-year leases in the UK's first offshore wind leasing round in a decade, see page 23.\n\nSolar: Lightsource bp is further accelerating growth, now targeting up to 25GW of capacity by 2025 and has agreed to exclusively develop a 9GW solar pipeline for bp, following our 2021 acquisition of 7X Energy, see page 19.\n\nConvenience & mobility: we have increased investment in our EV charging business compared to 2020. This aligns with our aim to accelerate our EV charging ambition across key growth markets and to grow our network of around 13,100 charge points today, to more than 100,000 by 2030. In 2021, we acquired AMPLY Power, an EV charging and energy management provider for fleets in the US, accelerating our entry into one of the fastest growing fleet charging markets in the world. In Europe, we entered a strategic partnership with MercedesBenz and BMW with an investment in Digital Charging Solutions, a leading developer of digital charging software for automotive manufacturers and fleet operators, connecting EV drivers across Europe to our network of charge points.\n\nHydrogen is another key area where we expect significant future scale-up through our announced H2 Teesside (see page 14), Lingen and Oman projects, which are part of our highgraded hopper.\n\nAs announced in February 2022, going forward we expect to increase the proportion of capital expenditure invested in transition growth businesses to more than 40% of total spend by 2025 rising to around 50% by 2030.\n\nThis is underpinned by five transition growth engines: bioenergy, convenience, EV charging, renewables and hydrogen see page 16.\n\n## Investment governance and evaluating consistency with the Paris goals\n\n## Governance framework\n\nbp's investments fall within a governance framework. This seeks to ensure investments align with our strategy, fall within our prevailing financial frame, and add shareholder value. It also means that investments can be assessed consistently and against a range of outcomes relevant to our strategy, including a range of environmental and sustainability criteria.\n\nInvestments follow an integrated stage-gate process designed to enable our businesses to choose and develop the most attractive investment cases. A balanced set of investment criteria is used, see page 34. This allows for the comparison and prioritization of investments across an increasingly diverse range of business models.\n\nThe governance framework also specifies that proposed investments are tested against the relevant assumptions, including carbon prices for projected operational emissions where applicable, and are subject to assurance by functions independent of the business before a final investment decision (FID) is taken.\n\n## The role of the board\n\nThe board assesses capital allocation across the bp portfolio, including the level and mix of capital expenditures and divestments, strategic acquisitions, distribution choices and deleverage.\n\nThe board reviews and approves capital investments that are more than $3 billion for investments in resilient hydrocarbons projects, more than $1 billion for investments in all non-oil and gas investments and, in addition, any significant inorganic acquisition that is exceptional or unique in nature.\n\n## Resource commitment meeting\n\nFor capital investments above defined financial thresholds for organic or inorganic spend, investment approval is conducted through the executive-level resource commitment meeting (RCM), which is chaired by the chief executive officer.\n\nThe RCM reviews the merits of each investment case against a balanced set of criteria and considers any key issues raised in the assurance process.\n\nThe CA100+ resolution \uf0ab requires bp to disclose how we evaluate the consistency of new material capex investments \uf0ab with (i) the Paris goals and (ii) a range of other outcomes relevant to bp's strategy.\n\nbp's evaluation of consistency of such investments with the Paris goals was undertaken by the RCM for new material capex investments sanctioned in 2021, see page 36.\n\nbp's evaluation of an investment's consistency with 'a range of other relevant outcomes' is achieved by considering its merits against bp's balanced investment criteria, described on page 34.\n\n## bp board\n\nReviews and approves investment cases more than $3 billion for resilient hydrocarbons, more than $1 billion for all transition or low carbon investments \uf0ab and any significant inorganic acquisition that is exceptional or unique in nature.\n\n## Resource commitment meeting\n\nForum for approval of investments related to existing and new lines of business above $250 million organic and $25 million inorganic, or which exceed the relevant EVP financial authority, and any project considered strategically important such as a new market entry.\n\n## Investment allocation committees\n\nEVP-level forums to review investment cases within a business group as per individual EVP financial authority (up to $250 million organic, $25 million inorganic capital investment).\n\n## Business unit investment governance meetings\n\nSVP-level forums which review investment cases within a business group, enabler or integrator up to the individual SVP financial authority.\n\n## Cross-group meetings and forums\n\nMeetings and forums to allow cross-group discussions and integration. Includes country forums, regional energy plan forum, the production & operations carbon table and digital forum. The forums do not hold decision rights, but inform and underpin the decisionmaking process delivering integration opportunities across bp.",

        "page_content": "## Balanced investment criteria\n\nAll group-wide investment cases must set out their investment merits and are considered against a set of balanced investment criteria.\n\nThis standardized approach is intended to create a level playing field for decision-making and allows portfolio-wide comparisons of investment cases. Further, the decision to endorse an investment based on the information provided represents bp's evaluation that the investment is consistent with what the 2019 CA100+ resolution \uf0ab refers to as 'a range of other outcomes relevant to bp's strategy'.\n\n## Six investment criteria T\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nFor all investment cases, we consider whether the investment supports delivery of our strategy to become an integrated energy company and our net zero aims. We also assess if the investment case involves distinctive capability that bp has, or intends to develop, and whether it adds to an existing 'scale' business within the portfolio or could help us create one.\n\n## Safety and risks\n\nFor all investment cases, we provide an assessment of the key risks unique to the investment which have a significantly higher probability than usual or have a significantly greater impact (relative to the size of the project) were they to occur. Safety risk management at bp is underpinned by our operating management system \uf0ab , which is designed to sustainably deliver safe, reliable and compliant bp operations.\n\nIn 2021 the standardized approach for investment cases was reviewed to place more prominence on how the investment cases fit with our sustainability aims.\n\nThe intent is to facilitate the discussion of an investment case's consistency with the Paris goals, any significant sustainability issues that have been identified, and any impact on or contribution to our aims 1 to 3, in the context of the strategic rationale for the investment case. This helps to maintain the consistency of our investment framework with our strategy.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nFor all investment cases, we consider how any proposed business opportunity is connected to the energy transition and societal needs and the environment. This approach is underpinned by our sustainability frame and purpose. Investment cases above defined thresholds for anticipated annual GHG emissions from operations must estimate those anticipated emissions and factor carbon pricing for those emissions into the investment economics.\n\n## Investment economics\n\nFor all investment cases, we consider investment economics against a range of relevant measures, including internal rate of return, net present value, discounted payback, and profitability index, using relevant commodity prices, margins and carbon prices, see page 32.\n\nInvestments are considered against differentiated hurdle rates at different price assumptions.\n\n- 1.   For our resilient hydrocarbons portfolio, a payback of less than 10 years for upstream oil and refining and 15 years for upstream gas; together with an internal rate of return hurdle of 15-20%.\n- 2.  For our convenience and mobility business, we seek a portfolio-level return in excess of 15%.\n- 3.  For renewables, which typically receive debt financing, we seek levered internal rates of return of 8-10%.\n\nEach investment's expected internal rate of return in our lower-price case is also considered against a cost of capital hurdle rate.\n\nWhen taking investment decisions, decision makers in bp are expected to consider the six investment criteria outlined below, although their decisions may also take other factors into account as appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy and business model, see page 12\n\nOur net zero aims, see page 51\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Volatility and rateability\n\nOur investment economics metrics also consider the degree of uncertainty of the cash flows when considering investment cases. For example, some cases have more certainty of future costs and revenue projections. Variations in net present values for the key variables in an investment case are quantified by sensitivity analysis to give a range of potential outcomes against our key investment hurdles.\n\n## Optionality and integration\n\nOur assessments seek out integration along value chains. For example, we can integrate our US crude production with demand for refined products in Australia, Europe or China. We also look for integration across multiple products and services and multiple geographies and customers. For example, we explore ways to couple renewable power supply from wind and solar with gasfired generation and investments in green hydrogen \uf0ab to address intermittency, which can offer customers more reliable electricity.\n\nWe are also investing in technology companies with offerings designed to optimize energy use - these have the potential to leverage our trading activity and complement our own customer offers. Our investments from our natural climate solutions portfolio can offer credits to help offset carbon emissions associated with products offered to some of our customers.",

As a result, in the third quarter of 2021, we added a guide level for investment economics related to our lower-price case - that an investment's expected internal rate of return (IRR) exceeds the expected cost of capital even under our lower-price case. We have also lowered our operational carbon intensity guide in line with our decreasing portfolio average.\n\nAs our approach matures with experience, we may continue to adjust or supplement our methodology. There may be instances when new material capex investments are evaluated as consistent with the Paris goals despite either or both of these guide levels not being met.\n\nParis goals, a focus of the evaluation was on their competitiveness and financial robustness as the prices of different forms of energy and products adjust in response to the changing market environment.\n\nFor new material capex investment decisions, the evaluation used our central price assumptions, key elements of which are set out on page 32. Starting in the third quarter we also evaluated investments using our lower-price case.\n\nThe evaluation also used our carbon price assumptions when relevant, applied to the anticipated operational greenhouse gas emissions\n\n## Investment economics\n\nWe calculate economic indicators using our central and lower-price cases, and applying our carbon price assumptions to relevant operational GHG emissions. See page 32 for our key oil and natural gas price assumptions, which - as noted above - are in line with a range of scenarios consistent with the Paris goals. We then compare the economic indicators to the relevant economic hurdles, see page 34. We would typically target a minimum threshold of greater than 1.0x the relevant IRR guide levels, and less than 1.0x any relevant payback guide level.\n\nassociated with the investment, for the period to 2050. These include a price of $100/tCO 2 in 2030 which rises to $250/tCO 2 in 2050 (2020 $ real).\n\nIn addition to the quantitative evaluations described below, the RCM may also evaluate new material capex investments against the six balanced investment criteria (see page 34) using qualitative assessments.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWhere appropriate, we measure the operational carbon intensity \uf0ab of the investment relative to that of the 2021 portfolio average for the segment or the related business activity (upstream and refining). We would normally target a ratio of less than 100%, meaning that the investment is expected to reduce the average operational carbon intensity of that portfolio. The potential impact of new material capex investments on bp's net zero aims is a further consideration.",

All three of these investments were evaluated as being consistent with the Paris goals. Two out of the three new material capex investments were offshore wind projects in our low carbon portfolio.\n\n## Evaluation of investment performance against each of the quantitative guide levels a\n\nAll three investments met the relevant 'central-price case' IRR hurdle guide level as shown on the chart and are either low carbon investments \uf0ab (and therefore not evaluated against operational carbon intensity) or met the carbon intensity guide level.\n\nFor this reason, the two in-scope low carbon investments are not presented in the carbon intensity evaluation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a The 2021 investments have been compared to relevant guides (as applicable to the evaluation of each investment) and are presented here in order of the ratio to the relevant central-price case IRR guide level.

The location allows the partners to develop a fixed-bottom offshore wind project with a total generating capacity of around 2.9GW, sufficient to power more than three million homes. We also aim to accelerate Scotland's energy transition and create a new global offshore wind operations and maintenance centre of excellence in Aberdeen. bp has a 50% interest in this investment.\n\n## Irish Sea offshore wind\n\nbp and EnBW entered the UK's offshore wind power sector, forming a 50:50 joint venture to jointly develop and operate two projects (Morgan and Mona) in the Irish Sea that we expect to offer a combined potential generating capacity of 3GW, sufficient to power the equivalent of approximately 3.4 million UK households with clean electricity.\n\n## Mento gas development in Trinidad & Tobago\n\nbp and field operator EOG have approved gas development at the Mento project in Trinidad & Tobago. bp has a 50% working interest share of this investment.",

Adjusting for inventory holding gains, RC profit was $4.7 billion, compared with a loss of $18.1 billion in 2020.\n\nAfter adjusting RC profit for a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $8.1 billion (on a post-tax basis), underlying RC profit for the year ended 31 December 2021 was $12.8 billion. The result reflected higher oil and gas prices and refining margins, and strong trading results.\n\nFor 2020, after adjusting RC loss for a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $12.4 billion (on a post-tax basis), underlying RC loss was $5.7 billion. The result reflected low oil and gas prices, significant exploration write-offs, low refining margins and depressed demand.\n\nFor a discussion of bp's financial and operating performance for the year ending 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2020, see bp's Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020, pages 42-47 ; and bp's Report on Form 6-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 31 January 2022, pages 4-8, restated to effect the change in accounting policy related to the presentation of revenues and purchases relating to physically settled derivative contracts and the change in segmentation.

Under IFRS, reported earnings include the mark-to-market value of the hedges used to risk-manage LNG contracts, but not of the LNG contracts themselves. This mismatch at the end of 2021 is expected to unwind if prices decline and as the cargoes are delivered. See Financial statements - Note 3 for more information on impairments.\n\nIn 2020 the net adverse pre-tax impact of adjusting items was $16.6 billion, mainly related to impairment charges, a gain on the disposal of our petrochemicals business, certain exploration write-offs (reported within the 'other' category), and restructuring costs associated with the reinvent bp programme. The impairment charges mainly related to producing assets and principally arose as a result of changes to the group's oil and gas price assumptions. Impairment charges also included amounts relating to the disposal of the group's interests in its Alaska business.\n\nCumulative reinvent bp restructuring costs from the third quarter of 2020 to 31 December 2021 were $1.5 billion. The process is largely complete with the significant majority of restructuring charges booked by 30 June 2021.\n\nSee pages 339 and 340 for more information on adjusting items and fair value accounting effects.\n\n## Taxation\n\n%\n\n| Effective tax rate                                      |   2021 | 2020   |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Effective tax rate (ETR) on profit or loss for the year |     44 | 17     |     49 |\n| Underlying ETR \uf0ab                                        |     32 | (14)   |     36 |\n\nThe charge for corporate income taxes was $6,740 million in 2021 compared with a credit of $4,159 million in 2020. The increase mainly reflects the profit for 2021 compared with a loss in 2020. The effective tax rate (ETR) on the profit for the year in 2021 was impacted by fair value accounting effects. The ETR on the loss for the year in 2020 was impacted by impairment charges and exploration write-offs. Excluding inventory holding impacts and adjusting items, the underlying ETR in 2021 was higher than\n\nin 2020 due to the absence of the exploration write-offs with a limited deferred tax benefit and the reassessment of deferred tax asset recognition. The underlying ETR for 2022 is expected to be around 40% but is sensitive to the impact that volatility in the current price environment may have on the geographical mix of the group's profits and losses. Underlying ETR is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 386.",

        "page_content": "## Outlook for 2022\n\nMacro outlook\n\n- \u00b7 The energy markets are being impacted by the military action in Ukraine, which is adding significant upside pressure to prices. There remains, at this point in time, uncertainty, but price volatility is likely.\n- \u00b7 On the macroeconomic side this is likely to have significant economic and financial consequences for the region with global consequences.\n\n## 2022 guidance\n\n- \u00b7 For full year 2022 we expect both reported and underlying upstream \uf0ab production to be broadly flat compared with 2021. Within this, we expect production from oil production & operations to be slightly higher and production from gas & low carbon to be slightly lower. We expect the start-up of Mad Dog Phase 2 in the second half of the year and first gas from the Tangguh expansion project in 2023.\n- \u00b7 In our customer businesses we expect product demand to remain impacted by ongoing uncertainty around COVID-19 restrictions and continued additive supply shortages in Castrol in the first half of 2022.\n- \u00b7 In products we expect industry refining margins to return to pre-COVID historical levels as demand continues to rebound, further supported by elevated RIN prices. However we expect realized margins to remain impacted by high energy costs.\n- \u00b7 The other businesses & corporate underlying annual charge is expected to be in a range of $1.2-1.4 billion for 2022.

Compared with 2020, operating cash flows in 2021 reflected higher oil and gas realizations and higher refining margins partly offset by higher tax payments.\n\nMovements in working capital \uf0ab adversely impacted cash flow in the year by $0.6 billion, including an adverse impact on working capital from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of $1.4 billion. Other working capital effects were principally an increase in other current assets and inventory offset by an increase in other current liabilities. bp actively manages its working capital balances to optimize and reduce volatility in cash flow.\n\nOperating cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2020 was $12.2 billion, $13.6 billion lower than 2019. Operating cash flow in 2020 reflected $1.8 billion of pre-tax cash outflows related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Compared with 2019, operating cash flows in 2020 reflected lower oil and gas realizations, lower refining margins and lower fuels volumes partly offset by lower tax payments and lower working capital build.\n\nMovements in working capital adversely impacted cash flow in the year by $0.1 billion, including an adverse impact on working capital\n\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of $1.6 billion. Other working capital effects, principally a decrease in inventory and other current and non-current assets partially offset by a decrease in other current and non-current liabilities, had a favourable effect of $1.5 billion.\n\n## Net cash used in investing activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended 31 December 2021 decreased by $2.2 billion compared with 2020.\n\nThe decrease mainly reflected lower capital expenditure and an increase in divestment proceeds received.\n\nTotal capital expenditure for 2021 was $12.8 billion (2020 $14.1 billion), of which organic capital expenditure was $11.8 billion (2020 $12.0 billion). Sources of funding are fungible, but the majority of the group's funding requirements for new investment comes from cash generated by existing operations. We expect capital expenditure of $14-15 billion in 2022 and continue to expect a range of $14-16 billion per annum through 2025.\n\nTotal divestment and other proceeds for 2021 amounted to $7.6 billion, including $2.4 billion from the divestment of a 20% stake in Oman Block 61, $2.2 billion of proceeds relating to the 2020 divestment of bp's Alaska business to",

Other proceeds for 2021 include $675 million from the sale of a 49% interest in a controlled affiliate holding certain refined product and crude logistics assets onshore US and this transaction was reported within financing activities in the group cash flow statement.\n\nTotal divestment and other proceeds for 2020 amounted to $6.6 billion, including $3.9 billion of proceeds from the sale of the petrochemicals business. Other proceeds for 2020 include a loan repayment of $455 million relating to the TANAP pipeline refinancing; and $481 million from the sale of interests in bp's retail property portfolio in the UK and New Zealand. The other proceeds from the UK and New Zealand transactions were reported within financing activities in the group cash flow statement.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021 our target of $25 billion of divestment and other proceeds between the second half of 2020 and 2025 was underpinned by agreed or completed transactions of around $15.5 billion with almost $12.8 billion of proceeds received. We expect divestment and other proceeds of $2-3 billion in 2022.\n\n## Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended 31 December 2021 was $18.1 billion, compared with net cash provided of $4.0 billion in 2020. Financing cash flows in 2021 reflect higher net payments arising from actively managing the group's debt portfolio and lower receipts from the issue of perpetual hybrid bonds.\n\nIn 2021, 707 million of ordinary shares (2020 120 million) were repurchased for cancellation for a total cost of $3.2 billion (2020 $0.8 billion), including transaction costs of $17 million (2020 $4 million).\n\nTotal dividends distributed to shareholders in 2021 were 21.42 cents per share, 10.08 cents lower than 2020. This amounted to a total distribution to shareholders of $4.3 billion in 2021. In 2020 the total distribution to shareholders was $6.3 billion. The board decided not to offer a scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2021 and 2020 dividends.\n\n## Debt\n\nFinance debt at the end of 2021 decreased by $11.5 billion from the end of 2020. The finance debt ratio at the end of 2021 decreased to 40.3% from 45.9% at the end of 2020. Net debt at the end of 2021 decreased by $8.3 billion from the 2020 year-end position. Gearing at the end of 2021 decreased to 25.3% from 31.3% at the end of 2020. The decrease in net debt and gearing\n\nreflected strong performance and related cash flow generation during the year. Net debt and gearing are non-GAAP measures.

Natural gas represented about 40% (46% for subsidiaries and 36% for equity-accounted entities) of these reserves. The change includes a net decrease from acquisitions and disposals of 408mmboe (decrease of 282mmboe within our subsidiaries and decrease of 126mmboe within our equityaccounted entities). Acquisition and divestment activity occurred in our equity-accounted entities in the Southern Cone, the North Sea and Russia, and divestment activity in our subsidiaries in the US, the Middle East and the North Sea.\n\nTotal hydrocarbon production for the group was 4.5% lower compared with 2020.

The decrease in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily reflected lower gas and liquids realizations, lower gas marketing and trading revenues and were further impacted by lower sales volumes.\n\nRC profit before interest and tax for 2021 included a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $5,395 million, primarily relates to adverse fair value accounting effects \uf0ab of $7,662 million relative to management's view of performance, partly offset by the gain on the partial divestment in Oman and net impairment reversals.\n\nRC loss before interest and tax for 2020 included a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $7,757 million (including adverse fair value accounting effects of $738 million relative to management's view of performance). This primarily relates to impairments associated with revisions to the long-term price assumptions.\n\nRC loss before interest and tax for 2019 included a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $503 million (including favourable fair value accounting effects of $714 million relative to management's view of performance), primarily related to reclassification of accumulated foreign exchange losses from reserves to the income statement upon the contribution of our Brazilian biofuels business to bp Bunge Bioenergia.\n\nAfter excluding adjusting items, the underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax for 2021 reflects exceptionally strong gas marketing and trading results, as well as higher realizations and production offset by higher depreciation, depletion and amortization in the gas business.\n\nCompared with 2019, the 2020 underlying RC result before interest and tax reflected lower gas realizations and the impact of writing down certain exploration intangible carrying values.\n\nSee Financial statements - Note 4 for further information on segmental analysis.\n\n## Operational update\n\nReported production for 2021 was 912mboe/d, higher than the same period in 2020 mainly due to major project \uf0ab start-ups, partially offset by base decline and the partial divestment in Oman. Underlying production \uf0ab was also higher, by 9.0%, mainly due to major project start-ups, partially offset by base decline.\n\nRenewables pipeline \uf0ab at the end of the year was 23.1GW (bp net). In 2021 the pipeline grew by 12.2GW (bp net), due to growth in Lightsource bp, in which bp has a 50% share, and the acquisition of a 9GW development pipeline from 7X Energy.\n\nIn renewables by the end of 2021 we have brought 4.4GW solar and onshore wind projects to final investment decision (FID) and have 23GW project in our pipeline with a further hopper of options being evaluated.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\nGas\n\nThree major projects started during the year: the Matapal subsea gas development in Trinidad, the Raven field third stage of the West Nile Delta development in Egypt, and the Satellite cluster gas field in block KG D6 offshore India.",

Ltd. (SPIC) and Qianhai Foran Energy Co. Ltd., in China - for these three contracts bp will provide approximately 600,000 tonnes per year for 10 years starting in 2023 from the Guangdong Dapeng LNG receiving terminal, in which bp has a 30% stake.\n- \u00b7 Pavilion Energy trading & Supply Pte Ltd. in Singapore, bp will supply 800,000 tonnes per year for 10 years, starting in 2024.\n\nSee Oil and gas disclosures for the group on page 344 for more information on oil and gas operations in regions.\n\n## Low carbon energy Offshore wind\n\nIn offshore wind, in 2021 bp was one of the top developers in terms of acreage. We have built scale in two of the most attractive markets, US and UK. In Scotland for example, these positions in offshore will enable us to leverage integration opportunities with green hydrogen \uf0ab , EV mobility and power trading as we build the business. We are building a global leadership position in offshore wind.\n\n- \u00b7 In January 2021 bp and Equinor completed their strategic US offshore wind partnership to\n- develop four projects in two existing leases located offshore New York and Massachusetts, which together are expected to have a total generating capacity of 4.4GW (2.2GW net to bp). On 14 January 2022 this partnership signed a 25-year purchase and sale agreement with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority for 2.5GW of power offtake agreements for US projects Empire Wind II and Beacon Wind I, adding to the 0.8GW power offtake contract\n- secured for Empire Wind 1.\n- \u00b7 In February 2021 bp and partner EnBW were announced as the preferred bidder for two highly advantaged 60-year leases in the UK's first offshore wind leasing round in a decade. The leases, both located in the Irish Sea, offer a combined potential generating capacity of 3GW (1.5GW net to bp).\n- \u00b7 In January 2022 bp and its partner EnBW were awarded a lease option off the east coast of Scotland to develop a major offshore wind project. The partnership will develop it as a fixed-bottom offshore wind project with a total generating capacity of around 2.9GW (1.45GW bp net), sufficient to power more than three million homes. After this award bp offshore wind pipeline as of January 2022 stands at 5.2GW of secured projects.\n\n## Solar\n\nIn solar, we continue accelerating growth through our Lightsource bp partnership and developing our 9GW portfolio of US solar projects which was acquired in July 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 Since bp's investment in late 2017, Lightsource bp has brought 53 projects to FID at weighted average expected internal rate of return (levered) of 8-10% and entered 14 new countries.\n\nHydrogen and carbon capture and storage\n\nIn hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS), bp has created a hopper of 0.7mtpa of projects of which half have been announced such as H2 Teesside and Lingen. This hopper has the potential to grow further up to 1.3mtpa, as we continue to activate demand and scale up production.\n\nbp's growth in hydrogen is focused on growing scale in key regionally integrated markets, such as the UK, Europe, and the US. And as hydrogen markets develop, we aim to create a portfolio of globally advantaged supply hubs. These will deliver cost advantaged low carbon hydrogen for export to global customers. Our strategic partnerships with ADNOC and MASDAR and in Oman are examples of this.\n\n- \u00b7 In January 2022 bp and Oman formed a strategic partnership to progress world-class scale renewable energy and green hydrogen development in Oman. bp will capture and evaluate solar and wind data from 8,000km2 of land, to support the government of Oman in approving the future developments of renewable energy and green hydrogen hubs.\n- \u00b7 In October 2021, the East Coast Cluster was selected as one of the UK's first two CCS projects by the UK government, enabling our Teesside projects, creating UK's leading hydrogen hub to decarbonize industry /.notdefand heavy transport.\n- \u00b7 bp announced a blue hydrogen project (H2Teesside) in March 2021 and awarded the first engineering contracts for Northern Endurance Partnership and Net Zero Teesside power station.",

It is a key part of the integrated energy value chain and will play a core role in Oman's future development. We are committed to supporting the sustainable development of Oman's economy through our strategic partnership with the Sultanate - the production increase will generate value for both the Oman government and the Block 61 partnership.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decrease in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily reflected lower liquids and gas realizations and was further impacted by lower sales volumes.\n\nRC profit before interest and tax for 2021 included a net favourable impact of adjusting items of $209 million. This primarily relates to gains on sales of businesses and net impairment reversals, partly offset by updates to decommissioning provisions related to previously sold assets.\n\nRC loss before interest and tax for 2020 included a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $8,695 million. This primarily related to impairments associated with revisions to bp's long-term price assumptions. The 2019 result included a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $6,616 million (including adverse fair value accounting effects of $8 million), primarily related to impairment charges arising from disposal transactions.\n\nAfter excluding adjusting items, the underlying RC profit before interest and tax for 2021 primarily reflected higher liquids and gas realizations and significantly lower exploration write-downs, partially offset by lower volumes.\n\nCompared with 2019, the 2020 underlying RC result before interest and tax reflected lower liquids and gas realizations and the impact of writing down certain exploration intangible carrying values.\n\nSee Financial statements - Note 4 for further information on segmental analysis.\n\n## Operational update\n\nReported production for 2021 was 1,307mboe/d, 14.2% lower than the same period in 2020. This includes price impacts on PSA \uf0ab and TSC \uf0ab entitlement volumes and the impact of divestments in Alaska and bpx energy. Underlying production decreased by 3.8% mainly due to impacts from reduced capital investment and decline.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\n- \u00b7 Four major projects started up during 2021: Zinia Phase 2 in Block 17 and Platina in Block 18, Angola; and Manuel and Thunder Horse South Expansion Phase 2 in the US deepwater Gulf of Mexico.\n- \u00b7 We announced an oil discovery in a highquality Miocene reservoir at the Puma West prospect in the US deepwater Gulf of Mexico.\n- \u00b7 bp and PetroChina agreed to establish Basra Energy Company, an incorporated joint venture, intended to own and manage the companies' interests in the Rumaila field in Iraq.\n- \u00b7 bp sold shares representing a 2.1% stake in Aker BP ASA for a total of $273 million. Following the sale, bp holds a 27.9% interest, Subsequently, Aker BP announced its proposed acquisition of the oil and gas business of Lundin Energy, through a statutory merger. Following completion of the merger, which is subject to approvals, bp is expected to own 15.9% in the combined company.\n- \u00b7 In March 2022, bp and Eni signed an agreement to form a new 50:50 independent company, Azule Energy, a bp and Eni company, through the combination of the two companies' Angolan businesses. The agreement follows the memorandum of understanding between the companies agreed in May 2021. The creation of Azule Energy will be subject to customary governmental and other approvals, with the aim of completing the transaction in the second half of 2022.\n\nSee Oil and gas disclosures for the group on page 344 for more information on oil and gas operations in regions.",

The decrease in 2020 compared with 2019 was mainly due to lower crude and product prices and the demand impact of COVID-19.\n\nRC profit before interest and tax for 2021 included a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $1,044 million (including favourable fair value accounting effects of $436 million), which principally relate to impairment charges arising due to increased future expenditure and anticipated portfolio changes in the products business.\n\nRC profit before interest and tax for 2020 result included a net favourable impact of adjusting items of $330 million (including adverse fair value accounting effects of $149 million). The net favourable impact reflected a profit of $2.3 billion on the sale of our petrochemicals business,\n\nwhich was partially offset by restructuring costs and impairments. The 2019 result included a net favourable impact of adjusting items of $83 million (including favourable fair value accounting effects of $160 million).\n\nAfter excluding adjusting items, underlying RC profit before interest and tax for 2021 was $3,252 million (2020 $3,088 million, 2019 $6,419 million).\n\nThe customers & products results for 2021 reflect a stronger performance compared to 2020, despite the absence of earnings from our divested petrochemicals business and ongoing COVID-19 impacts.\n\nCustomers - convenience and mobility result, excluding Castrol , for the full year was similar to 2020 with the benefit of higher volumes offset by the impact of rising commodity costs and increased employee and digital and marketing expenditure in support of our strategic growth agenda. Convenience gross margin \uf0ab delivery for the year was a record.\n\nCastrol result was stronger, with volumes, revenues and growth markets earnings materially higher than 2020, despite the impact of significantly higher industry base oil prices, additive shortages and continued COVID-19 impacts.\n\nProducts - in refining, the result for the full year was higher due to improved refining margins, higher utilization and commercial optimization, compared to 2020. This was partially offset by a higher level of combined turnaround and maintenance activity and increased energy costs. The result for the year also reflected a weaker contribution from trading due to an exceptionally strong trading performance in the second quarter of 2020.\n\n## Operational update\n\nRefinery utilization for the full year was around 5 percentage points higher than in 2020 mainly due to lower COVID-19 related demand impacts. bp-operated refining availability \uf0ab for the full year was 94.8%, lower compared with 96.0% in 2020, due to a higher level of maintenance activity.",

Ltd. for Euro 3.5 billion.\n\nIn November, Rosneft announced that the Yermak Neftegaz LLC joint venture (Rosneft 51%, bp 49%) discovered a material new gas condensate field in the Taymyr Peninsula.\n\nIn December, Rosneft's Board of Directors approved a new Rosneft-2030 strategy, which incorporates an ambition to be net zero by 2050 for scope 1 and 2 operational emissions.\n\nSee Additional information for Rosneft on page 355 for more information on Rosneft.\n\n## bp to exit Rosneft shareholding\n\nOn 27 February 2022, bp announced it will exit its shareholding in Rosneft. bp's two nominated Rosneft directors, bp chief executive officer Bernard Looney and former bp group chief executive Bob Dudley, both stepped down from Rosneft's board on that date and have submitted letters of resignation.\n\nAs a result of bp's nominated directors stepping down from Rosneft's board, bp has determined that it no longer meets the criteria set out under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for having 'significant influence' over Rosneft. bp will therefore no longer equity account for its interest in Rosneft, treating it now as a financial asset measured at fair value. The change in accounting treatment also means that bp will no longer recognize a share in Rosneft's net income, production and reserves.\n\nbp will no longer report Rosneft as a separate segment from first quarter 2022 results.",

Compared with 2020, the underlying RC loss before interest and tax for 2021 included lower uplifts in valuation of ventures investments.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\nIn 2021, partnering with countries, cities and industries as they shape their own paths to net zero , we signed the following agreements:\n\n- \u00b7 Memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Qantas on 15 January, to collaborate on opportunities to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector.\n\n- \u00b7 MoU with CEMEX on 13 May, to explore solutions to help decarbonize the production and distribution of CEMEX's products and develop lower carbon offers for CEMEX and bp customers worldwide.\n- \u00b7 MoU with NYK Line on 24 August, to collaborate on future fuels and transportation solutions to help industrial sectors including shipping decarbonize.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n- \u00b7 We formed a joint venture with Aberdeen City Council to build and operate Scotland's first green hydrogen hub.\n- \u00b7 We agreed with Infosys to co-develop and pilot an energy as a service solution, which will aim to help businesses improve the energy efficiency of infrastructure, and help meet their decarbonization goals, on 28 October.\n\nbp also continued to invest in a portfolio of technology businesses, which we see as having the potential for high growth and to benefit and extend our core businesses, through bp ventures and Launchpad. Main investments in 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 IoTecha, an electric vehicle (EV) charging firm which uses Internet of Things technology to connect EV charge points with the electricity grid, homes, and buildings, on 25 May.\n- \u00b7 BluSmart, an all-electric ride hailing & EV charging start-up, India's first and largest integrated EV ride-hailing and charging service, on 24 September.\n- \u00b7 Acquisition of Open Energi, an advanced software technology company that uses AI algorithms to optimize distributed commercial and industrial power assets at scale, on 28 June.\n- \u00b7 Acquisition of Blue Print Power, a US-based company whose technology is focused on optimizing the power networks of buildings by connecting them to energy markets through cloud-based software, on 2 September.\n\nDuring the first quarter 2021 bp divested its holding in Palantir for $443 million.\n\nbp ventures portfolio company Lightning eMotors became a public listed company on the New York Stock Exchange on 7 May. Lightning eMotors designs and manufactures electric vehicles for commercial fleets, including school buses and ambulances, as well as offering charging technologies for commercial and government vehicles. bp, which has supported that company since 2014, owns approximately 30% of that company.",

Our sustainability frame links our strategy to our purpose - reimagining energy for people and our planet.\n\nOur frame focuses on three areas where we believe we can make the biggest difference getting to net zero, improving people's lives and caring for our planet - with aims and objectives linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWe report on our progress embedding and delivering our frame in our latest sustainability report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more at bp.com/sustainability\n\n## Reporting on sustainability\n\nWe updated our sustainability materiality assessment process in 2021 to take into account our sustainability frame as well as external developments related to sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. For the purposes of this section we have covered material issues, along with additional non-financial information in the following areas:\n\n## Our focus area: Getting to net zero\n\nOur ambition is to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero. In 2021 we continued to make progress against the five aims to help bp get to net zero that we announced in February 2020.\n\nIn February 2022 we announced that our strategic progress, combined with growing confidence in the business opportunities that the energy transition offers, has enabled us to update some of our net zero aims.\n\nWe now aim to be net zero across operations, production and sales.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 For aim 1, which encompasses our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations, we are accelerating our 2030 aim from 30-35% to 50%.\n- \u00b7 For aim 3, we are aiming to reduce to net zero the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2050 or sooner. Previously we had been aiming for a reduction of 50% in their carbon intensity. This aim now includes physical trades of energy products as well as marketing sales. For 2030 we are now aiming for a 15-20% reduction in the lifecycle carbon intensity of these products.\n\n| Aim                       | 2021  performance   | 2025 target   | 2030 aim        | 2050, or sooner,   aim   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| 1 Net zero operations \uf0ab   | 35% a               | 20% a         | 50% a,b         | Net zero \uf0ab               |\n| 2 Net zero production \uf0ab   | 16% a               | 20% a         | 35-40% a        | Net zero \uf0ab               |\n| 3 Net zero sales \uf0ab        | 0% c                | 5% d          | 15-20% d,e      | Net zero \uf0ab f             |\n| 4 Reducing methane        | 0.07% g             | 0.20% h       | 50% reduction h | 50% reduction h          |\n| 5 More $ for new energies | $2.2bn i            | $3-4bn        | ~$5bn           | ~$5bn                    |\n\n- a Cumulative reductions against the 2019 baseline on an absolute basis.\n- b Previously 30-35%.\n- c Cumulative impact on average emissions intensity of marketed energy products \uf0ab against the 2019 baseline\n- d Cumulative reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell \uf0ab against the 2019 baseline.\n- e Previously >15%.\n- f Previously 50% cumulative reduction in the average emissions intensity of marketed energy products \uf0ab against the 2019 baseline.\n- g The 2021 methane intensity is calculated using existing methodology and, while it reflects\n\nprogress in reducing methane emissions, will not directly correlate with progress towards delivering the 2025 target under aim 4.\n\n- h The 0.20% carbon intensity target is based on our new measurement approach, which we aim to have in place across the relevant operations by the end of 2023.

Scope 2 (indirect) emissions decreased by 1.4MtCO 2 e a , to 2.4MtCO 2 e a in 2021, a 37% reduction compared to 2020.\n\n## bp equity share reporting\n\nWe also report our Scope 1 and 2 emissions on an equity share basis c . In 2021, our combined Scope 1 and 2 equity share emissions decreased by around 14% to 39.1MtCO 2 e (2020 45.5MtCO 2 e). The reduction was associated with a number of factors such as divestments, including of our Alaska operations, sustainable emissions reductions (SERs) and turnarounds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind more data at bp.com/ESGdata\n\nAim 2 is to be net zero on an absolute basis across the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production \uf0ab by 2050 or sooner.\n\nThis is our Scope 3 aim and, based on bp's net share of production c , excluding bp's share of production in Rosneft. It is associated with the CO 2 emissions from the assumed combustion\n\nof upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). The estimated emissions from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production were 304MtCO 2 e a in 2021, a reduction of approximately 7% from 328MtCO 2 e a in 2020, mainly associated with portfolio changes, including divestments and existing field decline. This is in line with our aim to reduce our oil and gas production and was partially offset by major project start-ups and new well deliveries.\n\nWe are on track to meet our 2025 target of a 20% reduction against a 2019 baseline.\n\nAim 3 is to reduce to net zero the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell \uf0ab by 2050 or sooner.\n\nThis is a lifecycle carbon intensity approach, per unit of energy. This aim relates to the rate of GHG emissions estimated on a lifecycle basis from the use, production, and distribution of energy products per unit of energy (MJ) delivered. For the 2019 to 2021 reporting years, it covers marketing sales of energy products d .\n\nAs updated in February 2022, the scope of aim 3 for future reporting years is expanding to include physically traded energy products \uf0ab as well as marketed sales. In future, it may also cover certain other products, for example, those associated with land carbon projects. Compared to the 2019 baseline, the carbon intensity of bp's marketing sales of energy products e remained flat. This is because of a lower share in sales of gas and power products from 2019 to 2021, caused by a number of factors including a reduction in demand over the period and an increase in refined products demand postCOVID-19.\n\n## Average emissions intensity of marketed energy products efg (gCO2e/MJ)\n\n|                                                           | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Average emissions  intensity of marketed  energy products | 79 a   | 79 a   | 79 a   |\n| Refined energy  products                                  | 92     | 92     | 93     |\n| Gas products                                              | 72     | 71     | 71     |\n| Bio-products                                              | 27     | 28     | 29     |\n| Power products                                            | 38     | 43     | 44     |\n\n- a Deloitte has provided independent limited assurance, in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), on selected sustainability information (subject matter), for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. Their assurance statement will be made available in the bp sustainability report 2021 at bp.com/sustainability .\n- b Excluding bp's share of production in Rosneft. On 27 February 2022, following the military action in Ukraine, the bp board announced that bp intends to exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft).\n\n- d Please see the Basis of reporting for the list of energy products covered at bp.com/basisofreporting\n- e The weighted average GHG emissions per unit of energy delivered (in grams CO 2 e/MJ), estimated in respect of marketing sales of energy products. GHG emissions are estimated on a lifecycle basis covering production, distribution and use of the relevant products (assuming full stoichiometric combustion of the product to CO 2 ).\n\nAim 4 is to install methane measurement at all our existing major oil and gas processing sites by 2023, publish the data, and then drive a 50% reduction in methane intensity of our operations.\n\nAnd we will work to influence our joint ventures \uf0ab to set their own methane intensity targets of 0.2%.\n\nIn 2020 we set an intensity target of 0.20% by 2025, using a measurement approach. Our methane intensity in 2021 was 0.07% ah , down from 0.12% a in 2020. Methane emissions from upstream operations, used to calculate our intensity, decreased by 40% to around 43.0kt, from 71.6kt in 2020. Marketed gas volumes decreased by 1% from 3,075bcf in 2020 to 3,058bcf in 2021.\n\nAim 5 is to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and gas businesses.\n\nOur investment increased from around $750 million in 2020 to nearly $2.2 billion, the majority of which related to activities in offshore wind, solar and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Read more about aim 5 on page 33.\n\nAim 6 is to more actively advocate for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing.\n\nWe have stopped corporate reputation advertising campaigns and this is enabling us to redirect resources to promote well-designed climate policies.\n\nWe publish examples of our activity in support of aim 6 online.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See bp.com/advocacyactivities\n\nAim 7 is to incentivize our global workforce to deliver on our aims and mobilize them to become advocates for net zero.\n\nThis will include continuing to allocate a percentage of remuneration linked to emissions reductions for leadership and around 22,000 i employees.\n\nFollowing publication of the 2020 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F, bp sustainability report and ESG datasheet , we identified minor data reporting corrections and implemented methodological improvements which have impacted the previously reported aim 3 figures. Recognizing that amendments and methodological enhancements may continue to occur in the future, we believe that the rounding of aim 3 figures in this way provides a more reliable and consistent representation of our performance. Since this is the first year of reporting on this basis, our ESG datasheet on bp.com also includes carbon intensity on the prior basis of rounding to one decimal place.",

        "page_content": "## Streamlined energy and carbon reporting (SECR) information continued\n\n## Energy efficiency measures\n\nSince 2016 we have delivered 6.5MtCO 2 e of sustainable emissions reductions (SERs) \uf0ab across our operated sites. This is our key metric for tracking annual reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy efficiency savings and direct GHG emissions. A total of 120 SERs were delivered in 2021 leading to reductions of 1.6MtCO 2 e. This follows SERs of 1.0MtCO 2 e in 2020, which included reduced fuel use for water injection pumps through energy efficiency optimization in the Azerbaijan Georgia Turkey (AGT) region, and our US onshore operations, bpx energy, driving operational efficiencies and substantively reducing our methane emissions profile.\n\nEnergy efficiency projects delivered in 2021 include:\n\n- \u00b7 AGT region - waste heat recovery logic modification to ensure the reliable performance and constant use of hot oil heater with fuel gas consumption reduction.\n- \u00b7 bpx energy - multiple projects across bpx sites including electrification and removal of existing compressors reducing fuel use in the Permian basin.\n- \u00b7 bp shipping - reduced fuel consumption by introducing more frequent hull cleaning, which improves the efficiency of our ships.\n- \u00b7 Oman operations - the automation of gas turbine generators (power export optimization) through automating the manual set point and reducing exported power to a minimum.\n- \u00b7 Eastern Trough Area Project (ETAP) facility in the North Sea - reduced fuel consumption through delivering spinning reserve reduction by running just one gas turbine.\n\nWe take a portfolio-wide approach to assessing and prioritizing spinning reserve reduction opportunities. Spinning reserve involves running additional power generation machines to provide an excess of energy supply to protect production from plant vulnerabilities, including power generation reliability. Reducing spinning reserve can cause greater production exposure to power fluctuations. We use a risk-based appraisal of the benefit and impact of implementing reductions when considering reducing the number of running machines. This allows bp to realize the emissions and maintenance cost reductions from fewer running machines, while managing the associated production risk.\n\nIn 2021, we increased the size of the central energy efficiency team focusing on upstream and downstream assets. This team champions and builds knowledge within the energy efficiency discipline at bp by establishing energy best practices, benchmarking, and working on operational excellence. In 2021, several energy best practices were updated, and a scorecard was assembled to track key energy metrics for refineries.\n\nThe team is involved in several external groups working on energy efficiency including OGCI, IOGP, and Energy Star. bp runs an annual training course for new chemical engineers which includes energy efficiency and offers GHG & energy efficiency training for more experienced engineers and practitioners.\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nOur approach to reporting GHG emissions broadly follows the IPIECA/API/IOGP Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting GHG Emissions. We calculate CO 2 emissions based on the fuel consumption and fuel properties for major sources, such as flares. We report CO 2 and methane. We do not include nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride as they are not material to our operations and it is not practical to collect this data.\n\n## Ratio of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to gross production\n\nbp reports a ratio of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to gross production, see SECR table on page 53. This covers all our emissions and uses gross operated sales from our operated oil and gas facilities, refinery throughput and petrochemicals produced. The denominator uses output from production businesses, refineries and petrochemical facilities, which account for 95% of total operated emissions. The intensity ratio has improved due to our aim 1 reductions, as described on page 52.",

        "page_content": "## Climate-related financial disclosures\n\nWe support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which was established by the Financial Stability Board to improve the reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nConsistent with our aim 9 - to be a recognized industry leader in the transparency of reporting - we announced in 2020 that we would work constructively with the TCFD, and others, to develop good practices and standards for transparency. In 2021 we contributed to work requested by the TCFD of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to develop a 'Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach for Companies in the Energy System'. This work, due to be published in March 2022, is intended to provide business-relevant approaches to climate scenario analysis that support and inform disclosures about strategic resilience. Read more about how we have used the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue to inform our own scenario analysis under Strategy Recommended Disclosure a , page 61.\n\n## TCFD statement\n\nThis year we are reporting in line with the FCA listing rule for premium listed companies LR 9.8.6(8) b , which requires us to report on a 'comply or explain' basis against the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2021 c .\n\nWe consider our climate-related financial disclosures to be consistent with all of the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures and are therefore compliant with the requirements of Listing Rule 9.8.6(8). We have set out our disclosures against each TCFD Recommended Disclosure and in doing so have covered both the Recommended Disclosure and the related Recommendation d . Where applicable, therefore, we have made disclosures that take into consideration references made to the materiality of information in the Recommendations related to Strategy and Metrics & Targets.\n\nAlthough this is our first year of disclosing in compliance with the listing rule, our disclosures build on previous years. In preparing them\n\nwe have had to make several judgements, and while we are satisfied that they are consistent with the Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures, we will continue to evaluate our options for future TCFD disclosures. We plan to monitor TCFD guidance as it evolves and will consider opportunities to enhance our disclosures. We welcome feedback on our disclosures.\n\n## Governance\n\n## TCFD Recommendation:\n\nDisclose the organization's governance around climate-related issues and opportunities.\n\n## Recommended Disclosure:\n\n- a. Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nThe role of the board is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the company, generating value for our shareholders while having regard to the interests of our other stakeholders, the impact of our operations on the communities where we operate and the environment. In performing this role, the board sets and monitors bp's strategy and is responsible for monitoring bp's management and operations and obtaining assurance about the delivery of its strategy.\n\nAny changes to the company's purpose, strategy and values are reserved for the board for approval in accordance with the board-approved corporate governance framework.\n\nThe board considers that the strategy allows us to be flexible to adapt to market changes and scenarios to remain consistent with the Paris goals, see page 30.\n\nThe board's responsibilities extend to oversight of bp's internal control and risk management\n\nframeworks, including with respect to bp's climate-related risks and opportunities. This is set out in the terms of reference of the board, which are available online at bp.com/governance .\n\nThe board and its committees, including the safety and sustainability, audit, people and governance and remuneration committees, have oversight of climate-related issues e , which include climate-related risks and opportunities. The role of the committees in respect of climaterelated risks and opportunities is set out below.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities were discussed at every board meeting covering strategy, of which six were held in 2021. The board committees consider climate-related issues where they consider it appropriate to do so in the execution of their responsibilities. Oral reports from each of the committee chairs are included at the board meeting so that the board is kept appraised of relevant matters discussed in those committees including, where applicable, in respect of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nThe board continues to develop its knowledge and expertise on climate-related matters. For example, in 2021, it received a paper prepared by the chief economist to update them on key indicators which are used to track the energy transition, some of the key issues associated with these, and other developments shaping the political and societal trends affecting the energy transition. They also received training on Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to assist with their oversight of bp's net zero aims 1-3.\n\nThe board also reviewed corporate reporting documents containing climate-related disclosures.\n\nOur company secretary's office manages the process by which board and committee agendas are set and works closely with teams in bp to develop materials that assist the board to discharge its responsibilities, including in respect of climate-related issues where relevant.\n\n- a Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n- b https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/instrument/2020/FCA\\_2020\\_75.pdf\n- c In considering the consistency of our disclosures with the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures we have had regard to, among other things, the documents referred to in LR 9.8.6B and 6C, as applicable to the financial year 2021.\n- d In preparing the disclosures we have referred to the TCFD implementation guidance 'Annex: Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (June 2017)', available from fsb-tcfd.org/publication\n- e We interpret the term 'climate-related issues' to relate primarily to those climate-related risks and opportunities for bp which are relevant to the delivery of long-term shareholder value in the context of the low carbon transition.",

The CEO is responsible for proposing bp's strategy to the board for approval and leading the bp leadership team in delivering bp's strategy and annual plan.\n\nUnder their delegation, the CEO has the responsibility to oversee the implementation of a comprehensive system of internal controls that are designed to, among other things (a) identify and manage risks that are material to bp, (b) protect bp's assets, and (c) monitor the application of bp's resources in a manner which meets external regulatory standards. Risks, for these purposes, include the climate-related risks and opportunities for bp associated with the issue of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. This is set out in the CEO role profile at bp.com/board.\n\nThe assessment and management of climaterelated risks and opportunities is embedded across bp at various levels and delegated\n\nauthority flows down from the board, see page 74 for more information on risk governance and oversight.\n\n## EVP level\n\nWhere considered appropriate, climate-related risks and opportunities, were discussed at the bp leadership team meetings in 2021 as part of the regular business performance updates which are produced for these meetings.\n\nThe resource commitment meeting reviews and evaluates investment decisions, see page 33.\n\nThe bp leadership team provides oversight of risk, including climate-related risk, through the various committees described on page 74. The leadership team is informed about and monitors emerging risks via the 'emerging risk paper' produced by the SVP, finance, other businesses & corporate, which focuses primarily on short to medium term risk. They are also updated on the longer-term risks and opportunities associated with the energy transition via the 'tracking the energy transition paper' produced by our chief economist. These papers are shared with the board.\n\nThe executive-level group sustainability committee was established to provide oversight, challenge and support in the implementation of bp's sustainability frame and management of potentially significant non-operational\n\nsustainability (including climate-related) risks and opportunities. It met three times in 2021. During 2021 the committee considered entities' progress embedding sustainability, performance against targets and bp's position on certain strategic sustainability issues that present risks or opportunities to delivery. This committee is chaired by the EVP strategy, sustainability & ventures (SS&V) and comprises members of the bp leadership team.\n\nThe outputs from the committee are shared with the board and its committees, including the safety and sustainability committee, as appropriate.\n\nThe group operational risk committee provides oversight of safety and operational risk management performance for the group, where appropriate. Climate-related factors may affect certain sources of safety and operational risk such as severe weather events.\n\nThe group financial risk committee monitors the effectiveness of bp's financial reporting, systems of internal control and financial risk management, namely material group financial risks.\n\nIn 2021, in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities, they considered the proposed TCFD disclosures and planned approach to assurance and verification of non-financial reporting (including climate-related reporting) ahead of discussion with the audit committee.\n\nSafety and sustainability committee\n\n## Group sustainability committee\n\nChair: EVP SS&V Oversight of sustainability matters.\n\n## Resource commitment meeting\n\nChair: CEO\n\nAttended by CFO, EVP\n\nSS&V, EVP I&E.\n\nObserved by EVP legal\n\nand SVP internal audit.\n\nPeople and governance committee\n\n## Group financial risk committee Chair: CFO Oversight of finance, treasury, trading and cyber risks.",

Alignment between group, business and functional leaders is fostered through other meetings, for example, the C&P Sustainability Management Forum or the TCFD working group which leads the preparation of bp's TCFD disclosures.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## TCFD Recommendation:\n\nDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's business, strategy and financial planning where such information is material.\n\n## Recommended Disclosure:\n\na. Describe the climate-related risk and opportunities that the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term.\n\nIn setting and monitoring delivery of bp's strategy, the board and leadership team consider climate-related risks and opportunities across three time horizons:\n\n- \u00b7 Short term (to 2025): the next four years are defined by business and financial plans that are performance managed in order to deliver our 2025 targets.\n- \u00b7 Medium term (to 2030): looking out to the end of this decade enables us to think beyond our short-term targets and adjust course if appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Long term (to 2050): we use scenarios to help us explore the wide range of uncertainty surrounding the energy transition over the next 30 years. For more detail on our approach, see page 11.\n\nTCFD categorizes climate-related transition risk and opportunity as follows: policy and legal, market, reputation and technology. It also refers to climate-related acute and chronic physical risks and opportunities. Risks in each of these categories have been identified using a risk management process that our businesses, integrators and enablers are required to follow.\n\nFor more on how the relative significance of identified risks are evaluated, see Risk Management on page 65.\n\n## Climate-related transition risks and opportunities\n\nAt a group level, we have identified three broad, material climate-related transition risks, which are underpinned by underlying risks that are managed through the risk process outlined on page 65. These transition risks may cut across our short, medium and long-term time horizons, however we indicate below wherever there is a particular time horizon in which the risk has been considered. The transition risks are also global in nature, so we do not discuss specific geographies here, but the underlying risks refer to specific geographies where appropriate a .\n\nWe also recognize significant potential for upside - or opportunity - associated with some of these risks. These are discussed under each risk and in respect of Recommended Disclosure (b) below we also describe the potential impacts of both the risks and opportunities to bp.\n\n## #1 The value of our hydrocarbon business could be impacted by climate change and the energy transition.\n\nChanges in policy, legislation, consumer preferences or markets as a result of growing concerns about climate change and the energy transition could reduce demand for fossil fuels or lower their price relative to our financial planning assumptions, particularly in the medium to long term, negatively impacting returns from or the value of our hydrocarbon businesses. Alternatively, prices for oil and natural gas and refined products during the next decade could remain higher than our financial planning assumptions under certain transition pathways, including those that are aligned with 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThe energy transition could impact the demand for commodities such as oil, natural gas and refined products and their future prices relative to our financial planning assumptions, which in turn may affect the returns from our hydrocarbon businesses. Changes in regulations, including carbon pricing and fossil fuel policies, could also impact compliance and operating costs in our oil and natural gas production and refining businesses. If oil, natural gas and refined product prices are higher than our financial planning assumptions, this could strengthen returns from our hydrocarbon businesses (including securing higher proceeds from assets we choose to divest) which may enable us to deliver enhanced shareholder value, further strengthen our balance sheet and invest more in the transition, in line with our financial frame. Demand for oil, natural gas and/or refined products could\n\nalso remain higher for longer, which could support stronger and more sustained refining and trading margins - particularly as we focus our oil, natural gas and refining portfolios as part of our strategy (see page 12). We intend to reduce our hydrocarbon production over time.\n\n## #2 Our ability to grow or deliver expected returns from our transition growth businesses could be impacted by the energy transition.\n\nFactors including a lack of, or insufficient development and application of, policies, regulations and frameworks that support low carbon businesses; insufficient consumer demand for our low carbon offering; strong competition in the market; or the insufficiently rapid development of supporting technologies and supply chains for low carbon energies could restrict growth of, or returns from, our transition businesses. This could particularly impact bp in the short to medium term as we seek to grow our low carbon businesses but could also represent a longer-term risk. Alternatively, demand, policy support or enabling technology for renewables could support a more rapid portfolio shift with expansion of our low carbon businesses and higher returns from them.\n\nSome low carbon businesses, including renewable power, bioenergy and emerging technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS), rely on policy support to promote growth. Our aim 6 is to more actively advocate for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing (see page 52).\n\nChanges in customer preferences, pace of technology development and costs could also impact the markets for low carbon products and services. For example, the pace of adoption of electric vehicles (EV) could impact utilization rates, and consequently returns, from our EV charging networks - this is an area we are seeing an acceleration in growth in some regions, and hence are stepping up our strategic plans (see page 16).\n\nWe recognize that the pace of our transition relative to our core low carbon target sectors and regions is important. If we move more slowly than those markets, we may miss investment opportunities and customers may prefer different suppliers with potential negative consequences both to demand for our products and our reputation. If we move faster than these markets, we risk investing in technologies or low carbon products that are unsuccessful because there is insufficient demand for them - but our investment may also help to stimulate demand and provide us with a leading position in growth markets.",

        "page_content": "## #3 Our ability to implement our strategy could be impacted by evolving attitudes towards the energy sector, climate change and the energy transition.\n\nIf bp, or the energy sector more broadly, is perceived negatively by stakeholders, this could have a number of consequences, for example: adverse litigation; reputational impacts, including our ability to attract and retain talent; and shareholder action. These consequences could occur in the short, medium or long term. Alternatively, increased support from our stakeholders could enable access to additional capital and new investors, strengthening our ability to deliver our strategy and enabling faster growth of our low carbon businesses.\n\nWe see signs that the energy transition is accelerating, and along with the strategic progress we are already making, this gives us growing confidence in the opportunities of the energy transition, allowing us to accelerate our net zero ambition and aims, see page 51.\n\nPerceived inconsistencies between our business and the pace of our transition with policy and societal trends could have reputational and commercial impacts that impair our ability to deliver our strategy - but we also see potential for bp to be positively differentiated as a result of delivering against our strategy, ambition and aims.\n\n## Climate-related physical risks\n\nIn addition to transition risks, we have also identified potential climate-related physical risks. These primarily relate to severe weather and often represent potential for increased drivers for safety and operational risks to our operations, particularly process safety, personal safety, and environmental risks, see Risk factors page 76. In relation to our offshore facilities, climate change could create greater uncertainty around severe weather events, such as extreme waves, particularly in the medium to long term, which in turn could affect the future risk profile of an asset over its lifetime. We also recognize that we could face other forms of physical climate-related risk over the longer term, for example associated with sea level rise, extreme temperatures and flooding, which could impact our operations. Given the primarily operational, and locally specific, nature of the identified physical risks, they are not grouped in the same way as transition risks.\n\nWater resources are increasingly under pressure from various factors, including, climate change and those pose a potential risk to some of our operations that depend on the availability of freshwater. Based on analysis using the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas, four of our 17 major operating sites were located in regions with medium to\n\nextremely high water stress in 2021. See page 68 for more information on steps we are taking to improve water efficiency.\n\nIn common with other businesses around the world, in the longer term we could face adverse market conditions associated with large-scale cumulative impacts of physical climate change if global mitigation and adaptation efforts are insufficient or unsuccessful. The bp Energy Outlook 2022 used estimates that drew on available economic literature to explore the potential impact of climate change on GDP over the next 30 years. It assumed that in all scenarios, GDP is lower than in a hypothetical world where greenhouse gas concentrations do not rise any further. However, the analysis highlighted that estimating the potential size of these impacts is highly uncertain.\n\nWe support the goals of the Paris Agreement and believe that the best mitigation against these types of physical risk is to seek to contribute along with others, to the success of global climate mitigation efforts. Our strategy seeks to position us to make such a positive contribution. We do not currently foresee any material opportunities arising from changes in the physical environment as a result of climate change. However, the actions we are taking to make our operations more resilient, for example through improving efficiency of our freshwater use, may also bring about benefits such as reduced costs.\n\n## Recommended Disclosure:\n\nb. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n\nOur strategy to evolve from being an international oil company focused on producing resources to an integrated energy company focused on delivering solutions for customers, including our net zero ambition and aims (see page 51), has been informed by, among other inputs, the climate-related risks and opportunities associated with the energy transition described above; the same is true of our financial and business processes. We describe how we use scenarios to inform our strategy on page 11.\n\nThe opportunities presented by the energy transition have enabled us to go further with our net zero aims. In February 2022 we announced that we are now aiming to be net zero across operations, production and sales by 2050 or sooner. We believe our ambition is both good business and supports society's drive towards the Paris goals.\n\n- \u00b7 Resilient hydrocarbons: recognizing the risks that the energy transition could present to our hydrocarbons business, we are focusing our upstream portfolio to be smaller and more price resilient. In support of this,\n\nwe are also working to manage down both our costs and the operational GHG emissions associated with bp's hydrocarbon operations. In 2020 we raised the investment thresholds for new oil and natural gas projects (see page 32) to help our portfolio generate sustainable cash flows even in a lower price environment. We also adjusted our long-term oil and natural gas price assumptions downwards, and consequently recognized material impairment charges and exploration write-offs, totalling around $23 billion. In 2021 net impairment reversals of around $1 billion were recognized, see Financial statements - Note 3 and Note 7 for more information.\n\nAs a result of future investments and divestments, and the natural depletion of fields, we expect our net production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in 2030 to be around 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, or 40%, lower than in 2019 (see page 16), and the Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations (the majority of which are associated with the operating assets in our hydrocarbons portfolio) to be 50% lower in 2030 than in 2019.\n\nWe see cash flow from our hydrocarbon businesses, as well as proceeds from divestments, as helping to fund our investment into transition growth businesses as well as delivering shareholder value and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The energy transition may also impact demand for certain refined products in the future, which could reduce prices for these products leading to lower refinery margins and forcing less efficient refineries to be retired. Consequently, we are improving and high-grading our refining business - through conversion, consolidation of less advantaged units, or divestments - to provide resilience in a lower margin environment, while simultaneously transforming parts of our portfolio into low carbon fuel production hubs. As a result, we are aiming for our oil refining throughput to fall from 1.7 million barrels a day (mmb/d) in 2019 to around 1.2mmb/d by 2030, and for biofuels production to triple over the same period. We also aim to increase production of biogas 20-fold by 2030 through leveraging our existing position as the largest US biogas supplier to the road transportation sector and expansion in Europe.\n\nAccounting judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on our hydrocarbon assets, including consideration of potential impacts over the expected useful lives of upstream oil and gas and refining assets, are described further in Financial statements - Note 1.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\n- \u00b7 Convenience & mobility: recognizing the growing opportunities in low carbon mobility that the energy transition offers, we are accelerating our EV charging rollout and aim to have >100,000 charge points installed by 2030 and are further expanding our Castrol business into the EV market. We see these and other businesses being supported by our focus on 'on-the-go' charging and end-to-end integrated fleet offer. As the aviation industry also transitions, we are aiming to be a sector leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a 20% share of supply by 2030. We recognize the risk of a decline in demand for conventional vehicle fuels and products due to the energy transition and we are working to increase the efficiency and resiliency of our existing fuels and lubricants businesses through operating cost reductions and margin optimization. We are also leveraging digital solutions to deepen our customer-centricity and expand our customer and loyalty engagement platforms.\n- Integration of the customer-facing aspects of our strategy with our production of biofuels, hydrogen, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and electricity also helps to provide security of supply and access to higher margins in a potentially supply-constrained faster transition.\n- \u00b7 Low carbon energy: recognizing the opportunity to scale up our low carbon businesses over the next decade to meet growing demand and regulatory requirements, we aim to grow our renewables businesses and seek early positions in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). In renewable power, we aim to build a leadership position in offshore wind and accelerate our solar growth through Lightsource bp and bp's US solar pipeline. We seek levered returns of 8 to 10% for renewable power investments (see Financial frame, page 20). In hydrogen, we aim to leverage bp's existing refinery demand to build regional supply positions. As hydrogen markets develop, we aim to create a portfolio of globally advantaged supply hubs, and we are aiming to capture a 10% share of core markets. Increasingly, we will work to integrate CCS capability with our blue hydrogen \uf0ab and hydrocarbon projects. To help maintain resilience to the possibility of a slower transition, we continue to consider whether the necessary regulatory support is in place and seek to secure a customerbacked route to market for a reasonable share of energy produced by our renewable power and hydrogen projects prior to final investment.\n\na\n\n## Impact on technology\n\nWe are investing in technology that can help to generate value for bp and also help to accelerate the transition through focused scale-up and innovation. Over time, we expect bp's research and development spend to be increasingly oriented towards technologies with the potential for reducing carbon emissions and enabling our new low carbon businesses. See page 50 for examples of our technology investments in 2021.\n\nRecognizing the potential for disruptive technologies to impact our strategy, our bp ventures and Launchpad portfolios include investments in emerging technologies and business models that may help enable the transition to a low carbon economy. By investing in both our existing portfolio and new companies we can respond to both short-term and longerterm technology trends.\n\n## Physical risk\n\nThe potential impacts of the physical risks we have identified could include reduced production or throughput, supply chain disruption, damage to facilities, or in a most extreme case loss of life or an asset. Due to the uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change on severe weather events in the future, it is difficult to quantify the potential impacts associated with any increase in these risks as a result of climate change.\n\nHowever, where appropriate, depending on both the location and academic consensus on the ability of climate models to adequately represent future trends in the parameter of interest, we seek to take this uncertainty resulting from climate-related physical risk into account in our approach to design criteria for existing assets and new major projects \uf0ab . We have updated our metocean design criteria, where appropriate, to include consideration of additional models including climate and synthetic models and both forward-looking and historic models in an attempt to mitigate both model and extrapolation uncertainty. The particular models chosen will depend in part on geographic location. See Risk Management, page 65, for how we manage these uncertainties.\n\nWe are taking steps to improve the resilience of our operations to the physical changes that might occur as a result of climate change - including changes in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, and the potential for increased water scarcity, as described above. We have undertaken screening of present-day and future potential physical risk exposure for selected key assets and identified those sites with potential for heightened exposure to physical risks in order to prioritize these for further site-based assessment.\n\nAs part of this prioritized approach, in 2021 we began a detailed site-based study at our Whiting refinery in the US, where projected climate change may increase the frequency or severity of extreme heat, precipitation and storm surge events.\n\nRecognizing the potential impact of climate change on water resources, we are taking steps to be more efficient in operational freshwater use and effluent management. Our aim 17 is becoming water positive by 2035, see page 68.\n\n## Impacts on our financial planning\n\nCapital allocation: We plan to allocate sufficient capital to advance our energy transition strategy - both to mitigate the risks and capture the opportunities we have identified. This includes continuing to invest in resilient hydrocarbons while seeking to maximize value and scaling-up investment in our transition growth engines: bioenergy, convenience, EV charging, renewables and hydrogen, see page 16.\n\nOver time, as investment goes up in our transition growth businesses, we see it going down in oil and natural gas. Investment into our transition growth businesses described on page 16 is expected to represent over 40% of total capital expenditure by 2025, rising to around 50% by 2030. We expect that the capital employed a \uf0ab in those businesses will rise from over 20% in 2025 to around 40% by 2030.\n\nAccess to capital: Concerns about the energy transition could reduce the appetite of banks or debt investors to finance hydrocarbon activity. We do not anticipate any material change to funding in the short to medium term, and our financial frame includes working to reduce net debt and maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. In 2021 we reduced our net debt by over $8 billion. Since the end of 2019 we have repurchased around $15 billion of short-dated existing bonds and issued over $11 billion of new bonds with a duration of 20 years or longer, more than doubling the duration of our debt book to over nine years. Additionally we have continued to have good access to the commercial paper markets. Subject to maintaining an investment grade credit rating, we plan to allocate 40% of surplus cash flow to further strengthen the balance sheet in 2022.\n\nInvestment criteria: all investments are evaluated against our long-term price assumptions which we consider to be broadly in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the Paris goals, see page 32. In addition, all investment cases above defined thresholds for anticipated annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations include an associated carbon price into the investment economics, including $100/teCO 2 in 2030 (2020 $ real).",

        "page_content": "## Recommended Disclosure:\n\n- c. Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario\n\nOur strategy is designed to be resilient to a range of climate-related scenarios including those consistent with well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C outcomes (see page 30).\n\nThis year we used a scenario-based approach to test this resilience (see box - Scenarios and risks). We see this approach as having the potential to inform our strategy in the future.\n\nFor the purposes of our analysis we evaluated the potential financial impact that could occur on the majority of our businesses under business-asusual (BAU), well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C outcomes, based on the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue described on page 55, and assessed the possible impact on our 2030 group adjusted EBITDA in order to assess relative materiality of exposure. We then focused our resilience test on the most material downside scenario (lowest oil price) and assessed our resilience (as defined below) for the period from 2023 to 2030. We based these analyses on our reference group business outlook (see box: Our approach to testing resilience to transition risk, page 63) that aligns to our strategic aims and lies within the adjusted EBITDA range disclosed at our 4Q results and update on strategic progress on 8 February 2022.\n\nA core assumption of the analysis was necessarily that, aside from any implications of the external scenarios being used for the analysis, bp would deliver the assumed underlying strategic and planned financial outcomes for each in-scope business area out to 2030. We have not sought to mitigate the impact of the scenarios tested, for example through cost management or strategic adjustments, for the purpose of this assessment, but reflect that these remain potential future levers if required.\n\nIn order to undertake this exercise, we needed to identify criteria which could be modelled as proxies for strategic resilience, and we chose to do this through three lenses - our ability to continue to (i) deliver shareholder value, (ii) maintain a strong balance sheet and (iii) invest in the energy transition (see box: Our approach to testing resilience to transition risk, page 63). This was not intended to represent a 'definition' of resilience beyond the purposes of this exercise.\n\n## Scenarios and risks\n\nAs described on page 11, given the inherent uncertainty in the pace and direction of the energy transition, scenarios can play a useful role in describing a wide range of external economic, market, policy, technological and societal conditions in which our strategy might be executed, and the outcomes we might see as a result. These outcomes can help test a judgement about the financial resilience of our strategy to the uncertainty surrounding the transition.\n\nSuch scenarios do not and cannot represent all possible futures, however we value them as a simplified and schematic way to consider the potential implications of, and uncertainty inherent within, a range of possible energy transition pathways to a future bp portfolio mix.\n\nFor the scenario analysis exercise described here, we used the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue, see the table on page 64. We used all of the scenarios contained in a pre-publication version of the catalogue for our work. a Recognizing the inherent uncertainty in the transition, our analysis did not consider the likelihood of any specific scenario, rather took the full range of possible outcomes for specific transition variables from the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue.\n\nThe analysis we undertook is directly applicable to transition risks #1 and #2 - as well as their associated opportunities - as these lend themselves to a financially quantified scenario-based analysis. The scenario analysis did not directly address transition risk #3 - however, we believe that some of the potential drivers for transition risk #3 , namely policy and societal trends, may be implicit in these scenarios, and we believe that the successful execution of our strategy will, over time, help to mitigate this risk to bp as well as positioning us to take advantage of the potential associated opportunities. This scenario analysis exercise also does not specifically address climate-related physical risk, our strategic resilience to which is further discussed below.\n\n## Key insights from our scenario analysis and resilience test\n\n- \u00b7 There is significant uncertainty in the pace and nature of the transition to 2030.\n\nAcross, and often within, each WBCSD Scenario Catalogue family (BAU, well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C), the range of some of the variables\n\nselected for the scenario analysis is significant, reflecting the complexity and interdependencies of the energy transition, as shown in the table on page 64. Generally, we observed that the faster the pace of transition, the greater the uncertainty in the exact shape of the resulting energy system in 2030.\n\nAs an example, while the minimum 2030 oil price in the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue 1.5\u00b0C family is lower than in the well-below 2\u00b0C or BAU families, a wide range of prices are observed and the majority of the oil prices in both the 1.5\u00b0C and the well-below 2\u00b0C scenario families of oil prices are higher than our long-term planning price of $60/bbl (2020 $ real) - see chart below.\n\nAs explained above, while our resilience test was conducted against the most extreme low case oil price across all of these scenarios, it is observed that although some scenarios could result in a downside financial pressure, other scenarios, including several oil price scenarios consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C outcome, could offer financial upside relative to our reference group business outlook.\n\nRecognizing this complexity, we are cautious about placing too much weight on any one scenario or set of assumptions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Despite planning to grow the capital employed in the energy transition, we expect oil price to remain our primary climate-related uncertainty through 2030.\n\nOil price is likely to remain the main source of climate-related transition uncertainty for our strategy through to 2030, reflecting both the wide range of outcomes and the share of our expected total adjusted EBITDA over this period, that oil-price-linked businesses represent - note that for the purposes of our scenario analysis and resilience test, we have assessed the impact of oil price across both our oil production businesses and those natural gas businesses for which commercial outcomes are linked to oil price.\n\nAll of the oil prices in the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue BAU family offer upside opportunity in terms of group adjusted EBITDA, versus our",

In the 1.5\u00b0C family, the potential downside suggested by the lowest oil prices is around 26% of group adjusted EBITDA. However, oil price in several of the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios could offer a financial upside relative to our reference group business outlook.\n\nIn comparison, the potential scale of impact to our remaining natural gas and refining and fossil fuel retail businesses, based on the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue ranges, is smaller (<5% maximum exposure to 2030 expected group adjusted EBITDA across the BAU and 1.5\u00b0C scenarios). While we aim to significantly grow capital employed and adjusted EBITDA in our transition businesses over this period, the transition-related uncertainty to any particular business as a proportion of the group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 remains small (<3% for each business area). Our diversified portfolio helps mitigate exposure risk to any one sector.\n\n- \u00b7 As a direct result of our strategy, we expect to be less exposed to low oil price in 2030 than we are today.\n\nOur strategy to grow our transition growth businesses, together with our aim to reduce net upstream oil and gas production by 40% by 2030 through active portfolio management (see page 16), is expected to reduce our exposure to oil price over the decade. Though the relationship is complex, in a sustained low oil price scenario, we could see some natural offsetting of the resulting decline in revenues from hydrocarbons from faster growth or higher margins from our growth engines by 2030.\n\n- \u00b7 Our analysis supports our view that our strategy is resilient to a range of climaterelated oil price scenarios including those consistent with well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C outcomes. a\n\nHaving identified that oil price associated with the most extreme cases of the family of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios was the only variable with the potential to have financial impacts of sufficient materiality to potentially impact the resilience of our strategy, we then considered the resilience of our strategy to this potential downside.\n\nWhile the results of any such analysis must be treated with caution - each is necessarily dependent on numerous assumptions and methodological choices, and each has its own limitations - overall, this analysis and resilience test reinforced our confidence in the resilience of our strategy to a wide range of oil price scenarios throughout this decade, including in scenarios consistent with limiting temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nEven with the most extreme low oil price environment (as defined above) in any of the scenarios, sustained over the eight years from 2023-2030, in our analysis bp was found to be able to deliver shareholder value, maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in the energy transition, as defined below.\n\nIn a BAU scenario, we believe our transitioning strategy mitigates against the risk of a delayed and disorderly transition which might follow.\n\nShould the growth of any one of our in-scope transition business areas be challenged by the downside range in the relevant variable, our analysis suggests that the impact of this on group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 would not be sufficient to impact the resilience of our strategy in that timeframe. It is reasonable to consider each potential outcome in isolation since the outcomes for different business areas vary across scenarios.\n\n## Maintaining strategic resilience to the transition\n\nWithin the inevitable constraints associated with factors such as long-term capital investment, contractual commitments and organizational capabilities at any given time, part of bp's ability to maintain its strategic resilience rests in the governance by which the strategy can be kept under review as necessary in light of new information and changes in circumstances. To enable us to understand and respond to the changing pace of the energy transition, we monitor and assess key indicators and metrics, such as policy development, renewables installed capacity, electric vehicle sales, and low carbon technology costs. Our strategy as well as the associated risks, opportunities and our resilience, is also reviewed routinely by the bp leadership team and the board and updated where appropriate.\n\n## Resilience to physical risk\n\nAs described above, we have identified a number of physical risks which may affect our business and assets, the frequency or severity of which could be affected by climate change. We seek to manage these risks currently. We consider that our approach to managing these risks, described in Risk Management Recommended Disclosure (b) on page 65, supports our strategic resilience to them. For the purposes of this Recommended Disclosure, we have considered the potential for physical risks to bp operated assets to increase as a result of climate change (namely, increases in the potential frequency or intensity of extreme weather events) to such an extent as to have the potential to impact the resilience of our strategy.\n\nAs with our transition risk scenario analysis described above, we have considered our medium-term timeframe to 2030. This is because, given the nature of our strategic plans,\n\nbeyond that time horizon we do not consider it to be realistic or helpful to seek to present what would inevitably be an increasingly speculative view of the nature and potential location of assets we might expect to have in our operated portfolio; nor to seek to assess the impact of physical risk on them. Exposure to physical climate-related risk is highly dependent on geographical location and on factors such as asset design.\n\nWe have considered the potential scale of financial impact that might be required to potentially affect our strategic resilience. Our transition risk scenario analysis identified impacts on the earnings of our oil-priced businesses as having the most potential to impact the resilience of our strategy in 2030. Therefore, and viewing resilience through the same lenses that we describe above, we have considered the extent to which our oil and gas production business would need to be impacted by evolving physical risk for the scale of financial impact to be sufficient to jeopardise the resilience of our strategy in 2030. We concluded that a significant proportion of our combined oil and gas portfolio would need to be either permanently shut-in or temporarily shutdown to jeopardise our strategic resilience in this way.\n\nHistorically, severe weather risks to our operated assets have not manifested at a scale which could reduce earnings so significantly as to jeopardise the resilience of our strategy. As reflected in the latest science from the IPCC, it is in the nature of climate-induced severe weather events that their occurrence, intensity and severity are unpredictable and uncertain. Our own modelling work, undertaken on a subset of those bp-operated assets we consider to be potentially most exposed to present day physical risk, and which incorporated future projections of climate change, is consistent with this IPCC view. Despite this uncertainty, we have found no basis in either the IPCC report or the limited number of detailed studies we have undertaken, to conclude that climate change induced increases in the frequency or severity of severe weather events would be likely to result, at any point in time out to 2030, in disruption and shutdowns across our oil and gas portfolio on a scale that would reduce earnings so significantly as to jeopardise the resilience of our strategy.\n\nFor the purposes of this Recommended Disclosure, the resilience of our strategy was considered separately for the relevant transition and physical risks; accordingly, we did not seek to take account of any interdependencies or cumulative effects between the two types of climate-related risk, and the associated potential financial impact.",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to testing resilience to transition risk\n\nThe steps we took as part of our scenario analysis approach are outlined here at a high level.\n\n- 1. We focused our analysis on our medium-term time horizon (2030) which is far enough ahead to provide a divergent range of scenarios, while not being so far ahead that it is unrealistic to attempt to generate credible financial metrics for bp or for an individual business area within bp. For variables considered material (see below), we also assessed resilience over the period 2023-2030.\n- 2. Nine business areas, shown in the table on page 64, were included in the scope of the scenario analysis. These cover approximately three quarters of our expected 2030 adjusted EBITDA. Our analysis therefore covers the majority, though not all, of our expected 2030 portfolio.\n- 3. Our analysis sought to quantify the potential impact of a range of scenarios on bp's currently held (as at the time the analysis was completed) internal reference group business outlook to 2030. This outlook is used for internal corporate planning and holds a current deterministic view of our portfolio, activity set, cost and capital frame. The outlook used in our analysis aligned to the strategic direction shared in the 'bp update on strategic progress' announced on 8 February 2022, and the financials lie within the range of financial outcomes set out in that announcement. It also took into account a preliminary assessment of the revised adjusted EBITDA and cash flow, which bp may expect as a result of its decision to exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft as disclosed in bp's announcement on 27 February 2022.\n- 4. For each business area, we selected appropriate variables from the WBSCD Scenario Catalogue representing what we consider to be the primary area of exposure to the energy transition, and the full range of 2030 outcomes within each scenario 'family' (using the 'world' values in the Catalogue except for gas price, see table on page 64).\n- 5. By calibrating the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue 2030 scenarios to relevant business metrics underpinning our strategic planning (for example, oil price or EV demand/utilization), we were able to model the impact of each variable across the full range of scenarios and each scenario family, on associated 2030 expected earnings (adjusted EBITDA) for the business area(s) with which that variable was associated. For example, we applied an earnings rule of thumb appropriate to the period in question to the deviation of oil prices versus our reference case price. This analysis was unmitigated (see 'Other key considerations').\n- 6. This screening enabled us to assess the potential ability of each scenario to materially impact group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 (and by\n\nimplication associated cash flows), against the reference group business outlook. By modelling the specific business area within the reference group business outlook (described in step 3 above), both the relative contribution of the business area to group earnings at that point in time, and its exposure to the most extreme range of the respective scenario, could be assessed to identify which variables(s) and scenario(s) could have the potential to impact strategic resilience (as defined below) most materially, and as such should be carried forward into a multi-year resilience assessment. In this case, only oil price was assessed as sufficiently material and hence carried forward.\n\n- 7. Our multi-year (2023-30) oil price resilience test considered sustained low oil prices consistent with the most extreme WBCSD Scenario Catalogue 2025 and 2030 scenarios for 2025 the IEA (World Energy Model Net Zero Energy 2050) price at $36/bbl, and for 2030 the UN PRI (Inevitable Policy Response Required Policy Scenario) at $30/bbl (both 2019 $ real).\n- 8. For the purposes of this exercise, we considered the resilience of our strategy to climate-related transition risk through the three lenses described on page 61. We defined the following as proxy indicators for these lenses:\n- \u00b7 Positive group surplus cash flow \uf0ab , to confirm whether after funding, among other things, our disclosed capital frame (8 February 2022 investor update) and the dividend/share assumed in our reference group business outlook, sufficient surplus cash flow remains to maintain or reduce net debt and/or make share buybacks.\n- \u00b7 Healthy cash cover ratio as an indicator of the ability to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\n## Other key considerations\n\n- \u00b7 To aid transparency, we made the simplifying assumption that, aside from the oil price modelled, our strategy, operating model, cost basis, volumes, margins, sales proceeds and taxes would remain unchanged out to 2030. We have also used bp's internal view of potential shape of future distributions and uses of surplus cash as a basis for analysis. Hence, we do not consider actions which we might naturally expect to make in response to external trends, such as cost reductions, portfolio adjustments or capital reallocation. In reality, we keep our strategy under review and would seek to make use of opportunities to maintain our strategic flexibility in the face of the many uncertainties of the energy transition.\n\n- \u00b7 The design of a strategic resilience analysis involves numerous methodological choices and assumptions - any one of which could reasonably have been different, leading to different outcomes. We have found value in conducting this analysis; however, we are mindful of the limitations to any such exercise and the highly qualified nature of any conclusions which may be drawn from it. The disclosures provided here should be read in conjunction with the rest of our strategic report, where we discuss how we have developed, and continue to evolve, our strategic approach.\n- \u00b7 As outlined above, we have utilized our latest internal reference group business outlook as the basis against which resilience has been tested, as this is our latest deterministic view against which to model the transition sensitivities to 2030. Alongside disclosed elements such as the capital frame to 2030, this includes shaping assumptions such as future distribution and net debt management. Through conducting this analysis, we do not intend to imply or commit to a specific forward trajectory of usage of cash, beyond those disclosed in the full year and 4Q results update on 8 February 2022. While we cannot disclose, for confidentiality reasons, the detail of the deterministic case, the test assesses whether the resilience indicators in our reference group business outlook are impacted by the transition uncertainties tested. Further, by the nature of the timeframes considered, a variety of uncertainties exist around this deterministic case (including transition risk itself) as indicated by the range of adjusted EBITDA disclosed in the full year and 4Q results on 8 February 2022. It is not practical, and we have not attempted, to extend the analysis conducted here to any other potential outcomes within the disclosed range of group adjusted EBITDA.\n- \u00b7 Where rules of thumb have been applied, to convert variance in hydrocarbon price to variance in adjusted EBITDA, these are appropriate to the period in question - i.e. they reflect the respective 2025 and 2030 production portfolios and contract/price leverage for this period. Due to the evolution of bp's portfolio, these rules of thumb may diverge from any short-term rule of thumb that we publish.",

Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climaterelated risks.\n\nbp's risk management system and policy, described on page 73, are designed to address all types of risks including our principal risks and uncertainties described on page 76.\n\nAs part of this system our businesses, integrators and enablers are responsible for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks associated with their business or functional area. Risks are identified as outlined on page 74 and guidance to support consistency has been made available to our businesses, integrators and enablers and provides them with a climate-related framework and taxonomy, which they are able to use if they consider it helpful. Where risks are identified, businesses, integrators and enablers are required by our policies to assess them, including climate-related risks, in line with bp's risk management policy and this includes an impact and likelihood assessment which supports consideration of relative significance and risk prioritization of risk management activities.\n\nThe impact criteria outlined on page 74 include health and safety, environmental, financial and non-financial (such as regulatory impact) criteria and are to be used for assessing risks, including climate-related risks. This provides a consistent basis for assessment across bp.\n\nFor the purposes of our TCFD disclosures, we have made use of the TCFD's distinction between 'physical' and 'transition' climate-related risks.\n\n## Recommended Disclosures:\n\nb. Describe the organization's processes for managing climate-related risks. c. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization's overall Risk Management.\n\n## Risk Management process\n\nRisks which may be identified include potential effects on operations at asset level, performance at business level and developments at regional level from extreme weather or the transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\nAs part of our annual process the bp leadership team and board review the group's principal risks and uncertainties. Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy has been identified as a principal risk, see page 77. It covers various aspects of how risks associated with the energy transition could manifest. Similarly, physical risks such as extreme weather, which may be affected or intensified by climate change, are covered in our principal risks related to safety and operations.\n\n## Physical risk\n\nPhysical risks are typically identified at the asset or project level and are managed depending on the level of risk assessed.\n\nIn the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico, regions more prone to severe weather conditions, our offshore facilities monitor meteorological and oceanographic conditions through the collection of measurements. This data is collated and periodically compared against the 'Basis of Design' for the facility. If significant differences are observed, then this may trigger an update to the Basis of Design, prompting action to re-assess risks such as structural integrity and stationkeeping and if necessary, implement additional risk mitigations, for example updating procedures for shutting down and removing personnel from facilities ahead of severe weather events. Updates may also be made as a result of other new knowledge, analysis methods and data, including climate projections where appropriate.\n\nOur major projects are required to assess the potential impact of severe weather and projected climate-related physical impacts. Where relevant, potential changes in environmental conditions, such as sea level rise and ambient temperatures, over the expected lifetime of a project are to be considered as part of the design process.\n\nFor other assets, such as our retail sites, that are typically not exposed to a comparable level of severe weather risk, climate-related risks such as flooding or wind damage may be managed where appropriate through the emergency response plans and business continuity plans which are mandated through company-wide policies.\n\nAdditionally at a group level we recognize risk associated with the potential for increased water scarcity due to climate change and other factors and the impact this could have on our operations and in the catchments where we operate. The impact of this risk is assessed by looking at a combination of the water availability in the catchment area and the water needs of the relevant asset, see page 68.\n\n## Transition risk\n\nThe board establishes bp's strategy and monitors bp's management and operations to obtain assurance over the delivery of its strategy. This approach ensures the effective management of climate-related transition risks and opportunities facing bp associated with the energy transition.\n\nFor the purposes of our TCFD disclosures, we have grouped transition risks identified by our businesses, integrators and enablers, as described above, into the three broad material climate-related transition risks to bp, see page 58. However, we still assess and manage the component parts of those broad transition risks.\n\n## \u00b7 Policy and legal risks\n\nOur policy & partnerships team monitors and develops policy positions in line with bp's sustainability aims. This team works with bp's regional organization as well as corporate entities to discuss regional and global policy trends and support external positioning and interactions relating to policy and advocacy topics. Our group sustainability committee provides oversight of sustainability matters and our issues and advocacy meeting covers emerging advocacy issues.\n\nOur legal team manage bp's litigation, including climate-related litigation and advise on the management of associated risks. This includes the use of internal lawyers and, where appropriate, external counsel.\n\n## \u00b7 Market risks\n\nIn developing our business strategies, we consider market risks, controls and mitigations including future demand in the different geographies in which we might operate, the competitive landscape and the potential value proposition. We manage these risks through our investment decisions, our hedge trading and optimization activity, and through key business processes including the group investment assurance and approval process.\n\n## \u00b7 Reputational risks\n\nOur investor relations and communications & advocacy teams work to mitigate reputationrelated risks, which includes the risk of shareholder action. Our investor relations team co-ordinates engagement with key investors on both a bilateral basis and through investor initiatives to support understanding of bp's strategy and gain insights to inform feedback they provide to the group.\n\nOur communications & advocacy team manages corporate reputation through identification and monitoring of key issues and both proactive and reactive engagement with relevant stakeholder groups to communicate bp's positions. Under our aim 6, which is to actively advocate for policies that promote net zero, the team also leads advocacy campaigns for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing, see page 52.",

At bp we strive to conduct our business in a responsible way, respecting the human rights of our workers and everyone we come into contact with. Our human rights policy and our code of conduct help us do that. We respect internationally recognized human rights as set out in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, including the core Conventions.\n\nThese include the rights of our workforce and those living in communities potentially affected by our activities.\n\nWe incorporate the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which set out how companies should prevent, address and remedy human rights impacts, into our business processes. When working to remediate any impacts on the rights of local communities we are open to co-operating in good faith to agree remedial actions through state-led mechanisms such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development National Contact Points.\n\nWe recognize the importance of accessible and effective operational-level grievance mechanisms in addressing our impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was largely due to an improvement in the calculation of freshwater consumption across our retail sites and some measures of operational efficiency.\n\nAt major operating sites, 0.1% of our total freshwater withdrawals and 0.6% of freshwater consumption were from regions with high or extremely high water stress in 2021 (compared to 4% and 8% in 2020 respectively). This is mainly due to the divestment of Geel Chemicals and a downgrading of Kwinana refinery to low baseline water stress by the WRI.\n\n## Air emissions\n\nWe monitor our air emissions and, where relevant, put measures in place to reduce the potential impact of our operational activities on local communities and the environment.\n\nIn 2021 our total air emissions reduced by 38% from 2020 largely due to reductions in flaring at some of bp's operating facilities, including US onshore operations. bp's operated shipping fleet transitioned to very low or ultra-low sulphur fuels in 2020 to comply with the International Maritime Organization's 2020 MARPOL regulation.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nOur biodiversity position, published in 2020, builds on the robust practices we already had in place to manage biodiversity across bp projects up to that date. We expect that from 2022 all new bp projects in scope will have plans in place aiming to achieve net positive impact (NPI), with a target to deliver 90% of actions within five years of project approval. We also aim to enhance biodiversity at our major operating sites and support biodiversity restoration and sustainable use of natural resource projects in the countries where we have current or growing investments.",

        "page_content": "## Foundations\n\nOur sustainability frame is built on strong foundations: our values, our continued focus on safety, our commitment to ethics and compliance, our people, and the economic value we create.\n\n## Our values and code of conduct\n\nOur values of safety, respect, excellence, courage and one team represent the qualities and actions we wish to see at bp. They inform how we do business and the decisions we make. We use these values as part of our recruitment, promotion and individual performance management processes.\n\nOur code of conduct is based on our values and sets clear expectations for how we work at bp. It applies to all bp employees and members of the board.\n\nEmployees, contractors or other third parties who have a question about our code of conduct or see something that they feel is unethical or unsafe can discuss this with their managers, supporting teams, works councils (where relevant) or through OpenTalk, a confidential and anonymous helpline operated by an independent company.\n\nWe received more than 1,400 concerns or enquiries through these channels in 2021 (2020 1,600). We take steps to identify and correct areas of non-conformance and take disciplinary action where appropriate. In 2021 our businesses dismissed approximately 26 bp employees for non-conformance with our code of conduct or unethical behaviour (2020 50 c ). This excludes dismissals of contractors and vendors, and employees at our retail service stations.\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety is our core value and it is underpinned by our operating management system \uf0ab (OMS), which sets out how we aim to sustainably deliver safe, reliable and compliant operations.\n\nTragically, in July 2021 a contractor died in a pipe lifting incident at our Castell\u00f3n refinery in Spain. We deeply regret this loss. We are taking action to learn from this incident by codifying lessons into our OMS and sharing them internally and externally, so we can try to mitigate the potential for this kind of incident to happen again.\n\nOur safety goal is to eliminate tier 1 process safety events, fatalities and life-changing injuries and we have set out a bp-wide plan to help us achieve this. And in 2021, we continued work to strengthen our safety culture with the launch of a refreshed set of harmonized 'safety leadership principles', designed to guide behaviour and ways of working across bp - driving a robust, consistent safety culture.\n\n## Keeping people safe\n\nWe monitor and report on key workforce personal safety metrics in line with industry standards. We include both employees and contractors in our data.\n\nWe have seen gradual improvements in our personal safety metrics over the past five years, which we believe reflect our increasingly systematic approach and improvements in safety leadership and human performance. This work is ongoing with a continuing focus on our updated safety leadership principles and initiatives such as our roll-out of the IOGP Life Saving Rules. These safety rules guide our workers on staying safe while performing tasks with the potential to cause most harm. The rules are aligned with our operating management system (OMS) and focus on areas such as working at heights, lifting operations and driving safety.\n\nOur recordable injury frequency (RIF) increased by over 20% compared with 2020, where the unique impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on personal safety in 2020 was reflected in a lower RIF for that year. Compared with 2019, in 2021 our RIF slightly improved and, except for 2020, it was better than any time in the past 15 years.\n\nFor absolute injuries, there was a small increase in recordable injuries (RI) between 2021 and 2020, and a small decrease in days away from work cases (DAFWC) over the same period. In 2021, DAFWC were at their lowest ever recorded level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- e Incidents that result in an injury where a person is unable to work for a day (shift) or more per 200,000 hours worked.\n\n|                               | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Day away from  work case      |        |        |        |\n| frequency e                   | 0.051  | 0.044  | 0.047  |\n| Severe vehicle  accident rate | 0.034  | 0.009  | 0.050  |\n\n## Recordable injury frequency\n\nWorkforce incidents per 200,000 hours worked\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternational Association of Oil & Gas Producers benchmark*\n\n- *  IOGP 2021 data reports are not available until May 2022.\n\n## Our operating management system\n\nThe way our businesses around the world are expected to understand and manage their environmental and social impacts is set out in our OMS.

Our OMS also helps us improve the quality of our activities by setting a common framework that our operations must work to.\n\nWe review and amend these requirements from time to time to reflect our priorities. Any variations in the application of our OMS, in order to meet local regulations or circumstances, are subject to a governance process. Recently acquired operations need to transition to our OMS.\n\nIn planning our projects, we identify potential impacts from our activities and use the results to identify actions and mitigation measures and look to implement these in project design, construction and operations. Our OMS requires each of bp's operating businesses and functions to create and maintain its own OMS handbook, describing how it will carry out its local operating activities. Through self-verification, local business processes are reviewed and areas for improvement are prioritized, allowing focus on delivering safe, reliable and compliant operations.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nbp has a three lines of defence model to improve the effective management of all types of risk, including safety. The nature and extent of first, second and third lines of defence activities are based on the type and level of risk and comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 Businesses and functions the first line of defence: accountable for working to meet business objectives, including risk management, and for self-verifying the effectiveness of their own risk management.\n- \u00b7 Group functions the second line of defence: support the first line of defence in their management of risk and consider the effectiveness of their activities. Functions determine their activity set based on the type and level of risk which may include defining requirements, providing expertise (systems, tools and processes), building capability and conducting monitoring independent of the first line. The second line reports outside the line conducting the first line activity.\n\n- \u00b7 Internal audit the third line of defence: considers whether the group's system of internal control is adequately designed and operating effectively. Internal audit also tests the management of significant risks in the first and second lines of defence across the organization over time. The third line is independent of the first and second lines of defence.\n\n## Preventing incidents\n\nWe carefully plan our operations, with the aim of identifying potential hazards and having rigorous operating and maintenance practices applied by capable people to manage risks at every stage. We design our new facilities in line with process safety, good design and engineering principles. We track our safety performance using industryaligned metrics such as those found in the American Petroleum Institute recommended practice 754 and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers recommended practice 456.\n\nThe overall downward trend in tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events (PSEs) continued into 2021. Our combined PSEs have generally decreased over the last 10 years, apart from 2019. Our performance improved in 2021 with one fewer tier 1 PSEs and seven fewer tier 2 PSEs, compared with 2020. The combined tier 1 and tier 2 PSEs were down 11% in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nWe investigate incidents including near misses, and we also use leading indicators, such as inspections and equipment tests, to monitor the strength of controls to prevent incidents.\n\n|                                           |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Tier 1 and tier 2  process safety  events |     62 |     70 |     98 |\n| Oil spills - number                       |    121 |    121 |    152 |\n| Oil spills contained                      |     73 |     70 |     90 |\n| Oil spills reaching  land and water       |     47 |     46 |     58 |\n| Oil spilled -  volume (thousand  litres)  |    655 |    784 |    710 |\n| Oil unrecovered  (thousand litres)        |    308 |    494 |    300 |\n\n## Emergency preparedness\n\nThe scale and spread of bp's operations means we must be prepared to respond to a range of possible disruptions and emergency events. We maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans and work to build day-to-day response capabilities to support local management of incidents.\n\n## Security\n\nWe monitor for hostile actions that could harm our people or disrupt our operations. These actions might be connected to political or social unrest, terrorism, armed conflict or criminal activity. We take these potential threats seriously and assess them continuously. Our 24-hour response information centre in the UK uses state-of-the-art technology to monitor evolving high-risk situations in real time. It helps us to assess the safety of our people and provide them with practical advice if there is an emergency.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nThe severity, sophistication and scale of cyber attacks continues to evolve. The increasing digitalization and reliance on IT systems and cloud platforms makes managing cyber risk an even greater priority for many industries, including our own. The risk comes from a variety of cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders.\n\nAs with previous years, we've experienced threats to the security of our digital infrastructure, but none of these had a significant impact on our business in 2021.\n\nWe have a range of measures to manage this risk, including the use of cyber-security policies and procedures, security protection tools, continuous threat monitoring and event detection capabilities, and incident response plans. We also conduct exercises to test our response to and recovery from cyber attacks. To encourage vigilance among our employees, our cyber security training and awareness programme covers topics such as phishing and the correct classification and handling of our information. We collaborate closely with governments, law enforcement and industry peers to understand and respond to new and emerging threats.",

For our contractors facing the most serious risks, we conduct quality, technical, health, safety and security audits before awarding contracts. Once they start work, we continue to monitor their safety performance. Our OMS includes requirements and practices for working with contractors. Our standard model contracts include health, safety and security requirements. We expect and encourage our contractors and their employees to act in a way that is consistent with our code of conduct and take appropriate action if those expectations, or their contractual obligations, are not met.\n\n## Our partners in joint arrangements\n\nIn joint arrangements where we are the operator, our OMS, code of conduct and other policies apply. We aim to report on aspects of our business where we are the operator - as we directly manage the performance of these operations. We monitor performance and how risk is managed in our joint arrangements, whether we are the operator or not. Where we are not the operator, our OMS is available as a reference point for bp businesses when engaging with operators and co-venturers. We have a group framework to assess and manage bp's exposure related to safety, operational and bribery and corruption risk from our participation in these types of arrangements.\n\nWhere appropriate, we may seek to influence how risk is managed in arrangements where we are not the operator.\n\nOur people are the most important element of our success. We need a motivated, engaged, and diverse workforce to deliver our purpose and strategy. We promote a culture that generates the diversity of thought, approach and ideas needed to reimagine energy and move to a low carbon environment.\n\nThe people and governance committee reviews workforce policies and practices and their alignment with bp's strategy, purpose, values and culture and conducts workforce engagement measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on the people and governance committee, see page 106\n\n## Our people\n\n## Workforce by gender a\n\n|                        | Male   | Male   | Female   | Female   |   Female % |   Female % |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|----------|----------|------------|------------|\n| As at 31 December 2021 | 2021   | 2020   | 2021     | 2020     |       2021 |       2020 |\n| Board directors        | 6      | 6      | 4        | 5        |         40 |         45 |\n| Leadership team        | 7      | 8      | 4        | 4        |         36 |         33 |\n| Group leaders          | 192    | 193    | 89       | 77       |         32 |         29 |\n| Subsidiary directors   | 674    | 1,351  | 303      | 284      |         31 |         17 |\n| All employees          | 39,912 | 38,826 | 25,933   | 24,719   |         39 |         39 |\n\n## Number of employees at 31 December b\n\n|                                 | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gas & low carbon  energy        | 4,000  | -      | -      |\n| Oil production &  operations    | 8,800  | -      | -      |\n| Customers &  products           | 43,600 | -      | -      |\n| Other businesses  and corporate | 9,500  | -      | -      |\n| Total                           | 65,900 | 63,600 | 70,100 |\n\n## Attraction, retention and development\n\nWe aim to recruit talented people from diverse backgrounds, and invest in training, development and competitive rewards for all our people. We invest in employee development - with a focus on driving safe, reliable and compliant operations, and on building technical, functional and leadership capability. This includes a range of development opportunities for our people through a mix of on-the-job learning, developmental relationships with mentors, managers and peers, and training delivered face-to-face, virtually and through simulation or e-learning.\n\n## Diversity, equity & inclusion\n\nOur DE&I ambition is for bp to reflect the world around us.\n\n## Gender equality\n\nOverall, the proportion of women employed across bp remained at 39% of our global workforce in 2021 (39% in 2020). 41% of our 120 extended leadership team are women and our goal is to increase this. At the end of 2021 we had four female directors (2020 5) on our board. Our people and governance committee remains mindful of diversity when considering potential candidates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our gender pay gap report at bp.com/ukgenderpaygap\n\n## Ethnic diversity\n\nOur global, US and UK frameworks for action guide how we aim to improve DE&I in bp.\n\nIn 2021 we published a comprehensive global DE&I report, embedding expectations and metrics on DE&I delivery in our operating plans. In 2022 we reported on our UK ethnicity pay gap for the first time. We also aim to double our spend with US-based diverse suppliers by 2023.\n\nIn 2021, 31% of our group leaders came from countries other than the UK and the US (2020 30%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See our DE&I report at bp.com/diversity For more on the composition of our board, see page 84\n\n## Inclusion\n\nTo promote an inclusive culture we provide leadership training and support employee-run advocacy groups in areas such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability. As well as bringing employees together, these groups support our recruitment programmes and provide feedback on the potential impact of policy changes. Each group is sponsored by a senior executive.\n\nWe aim to provide equal opportunity in recruitment, career development, promotion, training and reward for all employees - regardless of ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws.\n\nWhere existing employees become disabled, our policy is to engage and use reasonable accommodations or adjustments to enable continued employment.\n\nIn 2021 bp joined the Valuable 500 - a global business collective made up of 500 CEOs and their companies, to drive lasting change for people around the world living with a disability.\n\n- a The number of subsidiary directors is lower than prior years following a change in the way that the data is collated for subsidiary companies, with associated undertakings no longer included in the data set.\n- b We do not report number of employees data against our new financial reporting segments for 2020 and 2019 as the numbers are not comparable following our reorganization in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\nWe are making progress in the areas of recruitment, workspaces and assistive technology. We have also formed partnerships to help source talent, assist with research and training and support students with disabilities build the skills they need to access the workplace.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nOur managers hold team and one-to-one meetings with their team members, complemented by formal processes through works councils in parts of Europe.\n\nWe regularly communicate with employees on factors that affect bp's performance, and seek to maintain constructive relationships with labour unions formally representing our employees.\n\nTo understand what our employees think and feel about bp, we run an annual 'Pulse' survey as well as 'Pulse Live' surveys, which enable us to monitor changes in employee sentiment on a weekly basis. We introduced a new overall engagement metric in 2021, which scored 64%. Pride in working for bp remained strong at 73%, but has declined by two percentage points since 2019.\n\nEmployees participating in the 2021 'Pulse' survey told us that their trust in our senior leadership had increased and more employees believe we are making progress on transformation with a simplified organizational structure. Some employees told us they do not fully understand our strategy.\n\nbp has committed to centrally focus and direct action planning in four key areas to strengthen engagement: connecting with purpose and strategy, future excitement, career development and inclusion.\n\n## Mental health and wellbeing\n\nIn 2021 we continued to offer employees access to a range of mental health support services. This included support from our well-established 24/7 Employee Assistance Programme, which saw increased usage in most regions. We also enabled employees to share access to the Headspace meditation app with two family members.\n\n## Share ownership\n\nWe continue to encourage employee share ownership and have a number of employee share plans in place. For example, we operate a ShareMatch plan in more than 50 countries, matching bp shares purchased by our employees. We also make annual share awards as part of our total reward package all for senior and mid-level employees globally, and a portion of our more junior professional grade employees.\n\nIn February 2021, we introduced the Reinvent bp share award to incentivize our employees in meeting our aims. All individuals employed by the bp group at the grant date will receive a one-off grant of either share units or share options, depending on employee level, that will become available to keep, sell or transfer in the first quarter of 2025, provided the employee remains in employment to this date.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nWe operate in parts of the world where bribery and corruption present a high risk. We have a responsibility to our employees, our shareholders and the countries and communities in which we do business to be ethical and lawful in all our work.\n\nOur code of conduct explicitly prohibits engaging in bribery or corruption in any form. Our group-wide anti-bribery and corruption policy and procedures include measures and guidance to assess risks, understand relevant laws and report concerns. They apply to all bp-operated businesses.\n\nWe provide training to employees appropriate to the nature or location of their role. In 2021, over 12,700 employees completed anti-bribery and corruption training (2020 7,700). We assess any exposure to bribery and corruption risk when working with suppliers and business partners. Where appropriate, we put in place a risk mitigation plan or we reject them if we conclude that risks are too high.\n\nWe also conduct anti-bribery compliance audits on selected suppliers to assess their conformance with our anti-bribery and corruption contractual requirements. We take corrective action with suppliers and business partners that fail to meet our expectations, which may include terminating contracts. In 2021 we issued 4 a audit reports (2020 35).\n\n## Political donations and activity\n\nWe prohibit the use of bp funds or resources to support any political candidate or party. We recognize the rights of our employees to participate in the political process and these rights are governed by the applicable laws in the countries where we operate. The way in which we interact with those governments depends on the legal and regulatory framework in each country. Our stance on political activity is defined in our code of conduct.\n\nIn the US we provide administrative support for the bp employee political action committee (PAC), which is a non-partisan committee that encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All bp employee PAC contributions are reviewed for compliance with federal and state law and are publicly reported in accordance with US election laws.\n\nThe PAC paused all contributions beginning in January 2021 and we expect to restart them in 2022. During this time PAC re-evaluated its criteria for candidate support.\n\n## Tax transparency\n\nOur code of conduct informs the responsible approach we take to managing taxes. We endorse the B Team responsible tax principles and we engage in open and constructive dialogue with governments and tax authorities. We do not tolerate the facilitation of tax evasion by people who act for or on behalf of bp.\n\nWe are committed to transparency around our tax principles and the taxes we pay. We paid $5.4 billion in corporate income and production taxes to governments in 2021 (2020 $3.3 billion).\n\nIn 2021 we published the latest bp tax report, providing more detailed information on how we approach tax matters and the tax payments we make.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The system seeks to avoid incidents and enhance business outcomes by allowing us to:\n\n- \u00b7 Understand the risk environment, identify the specific risks and assess the potential exposure for bp.\n- \u00b7 Determine how best to deal with these risks to manage overall potential exposure.\n- \u00b7 Manage the identified risks in appropriate ways.\n- \u00b7 Monitor and seek assurance of the effectiveness of the management of these risks and intervene for improvement where necessary.\n- \u00b7 Report up the management chain and to the board on a periodic basis on how principal risks are being managed, monitored, assured and the improvements that are being made.\n\n## Our risk management activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Day-to-day risk management\n\nManagement and employees at our facilities, assets, and within our businesses, integrators and enablers (see page 12) seek to identify and manage risk, promoting safe, compliant and reliable operations. bp requirements, which take into account applicable laws and regulations, underpin the practical plans developed to help reduce risk and deliver safe, compliant and reliable operations as well as greater efficiency and sustainable financial results.\n\n## Business and strategic risk management\n\nOur businesses, integrators and enablers integrate risk management into key business processes such as strategy, planning, performance management, resource and capital allocation and project appraisal. We do this by using a standard framework for collating risk data, assessing risk management activities, making further improvements and in connection with planning new activities.\n\n## Oversight and governance\n\nThroughout the year, management, the leadership team, the board and relevant committees provide oversight of how principal risks to bp are identified, assessed and managed. They support appropriate governance of risk management including having relevant policies in place to help manage risks. Such oversight may include internal audit reports, group risk reports and reviews of the outcomes of business processes including strategy, planning and resource and capital allocation.\n\nbp's group risk team analyses the group's risk profile and maintains the group's risk management system.

This aims to provide a consistent basis for the evaluation of potential impact and likelihood, facilitating a comparison across risks.\n\nRisk management and monitoring risk management activities can be prioritized where improvements are needed based on a number of factors, including the risk assessment, strength of existing risk management measures, strategy and plans and legal and regulatory requirements. Risk management measures, including mitigations, are to be identified for each risk and monitored to the extent considered appropriate. To support leadership oversight of decisions relating to the risk assessment and management measures, risks are to be notified to, and the business's risk management measures are subject to endorsement at, the appropriate organizational level (EVP, SVP, VP) depending on the assessed potential impact and likelihood.\n\nAs part of bp's annual planning process, the leadership team and the board review the group's principal risks and uncertainties and determine risks for particular oversight by the leadership team, the board and their respective committees. These may be updated\n\nduring the year in response to changes in internal and external circumstances.\n\nThere can be no certainty that our risk management activities will mitigate or prevent these, or other risks, from occurring. Further details of the principal risks and uncertainties we face are set out in Risk factors on page 74.\n\n## Our risk profile\n\nThe nature of our business operations is long term, resulting in many of our risks being enduring in nature. Nonetheless, risks can develop and evolve over time and their potential impact or likelihood may vary in response to internal and external events. These may include emerging risks which are considered through existing processes, including an emerging risk paper considered at board meetings, bp's risk management system, the bp Energy Outlook , bp's Technology Insights Radar and ongoing emerging technology scanning and group strategic reviews.\n\nWe identify risks for particular oversight by the board and its various committees in the coming year.\n\n## Risks for particular oversight by the leadership team, the board and their committees in 2022\n\nAreas of risk for particular oversight in 2022 have been reviewed and are listed below. These may be updated during the year in response to changes in internal and external circumstances. The oversight of other risks is undertaken in the\n\nnormal course of business.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nRisks associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy impact many elements of our strategy and, as such, these risks are considered through key business processes including agreeing the strategy, annual plan, capital allocation and investment decisions. The outputs of these key business processes are reviewed in line with the cadence of these activities.

Our financial frame is designed to be robust to periods of low price, whether or not due to COVID-19, with flexibility to reduce cost and capital expenditure if required. COVID-19 can also have operational impacts. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our employees and operations and have instigated and maintained mitigation plans where the business considers them necessary.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nBoth targeted and indiscriminate threats to the security of our digital infrastructure and those of third parties continue to evolve rapidly and are increasingly prevalent across industries worldwide.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through a range of measures, which include cyber security standards, security protection tools, ongoing detection and monitoring of threats and testing of cyber response and recovery procedures. We collaborate with governments, law enforcement agencies and industry peers to understand and respond to new and emerging cyber threats. We build awareness with our employees, share information on incidents with leadership for continuous learning and conduct regular exercises including with the leadership team to test response and recovery procedures.\n\n## Geopolitical\n\nThe diverse locations of our business activities and operations around the world expose us to a wide range of political developments and consequent changes to the economic and operating environment. Geopolitical risk is inherent to many regions in which we operate, and heightened political or social tensions or changes in key relationships could adversely affect the group.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through development and maintenance of relationships with governments and stakeholders and by being trusted partners in each country and region. In addition, we closely monitor events and implement risk mitigation plans where deemed appropriate.\n\n## bp's exit from its businesses in Russia\n\nbp announced it will exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft in Russia. This decision was approved by the bp board on 27 February 2022. In response to the conflict in Ukraine, bp's business continuity plans have been activated and executive, country and business support teams have been established. We continue to monitor impacts to our people and our operations, and mitigation plans are being implemented where needed. For further information see the segmental overviews on pages 3, 48 and 49.\n\n## Safety and operational risks\n\nProcess safety, personal safety and environmental risks\n\nThe nature of the group's operating activities exposes us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks such as incidents associated with releases of hydrocarbons when drilling wells, operating facilities and transporting hydrocarbons.\n\nOur operating management system \uf0ab helps us manage these risks and drive performance improvements. It sets out the standards and requirements which govern key risk management activities such as inspection, maintenance, testing, business continuity and crisis response planning and competency development. In addition, we conduct our drilling activity through a wells organization in\n\norder to promote a consistent approach for designing, constructing and managing wells.\n\n## Security\n\nHostile acts such as terrorism or piracy could harm our people and disrupt our operations. We monitor for emerging threats and vulnerabilities to manage our physical and information security.\n\nOur intelligence, security and crisis management teams provide strategic and operational risk management to our businesses through a network of regional security managers who provide front line risk management as well as conduct assurance activities through a team independent of the business. We continue to monitor threats globally and maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans.\n\n## Compliance and control risks\n\nEthical misconduct and legal or regulatory non-compliance\n\nEthical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws or regulations could damage our reputation, result in litigation, regulatory action and penalties, adversely affect results and shareholder value, and potentially affect our licence to operate.\n\nOur code of conduct and our values and behaviours, applicable to all employees, are central to managing this risk. Additionally, we have various group requirements and training covering areas such as anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, competition/ anti-trust law and international trade regulations. We seek to keep abreast of new regulations and legislation that could materially affect the implementation of our strategy or business and plan our response to them. We offer an independent confidential helpline, OpenTalk, for employees, contractors and other third parties.\n\n## Trading non-compliance\n\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to risks around our trading activities which could arise from shortcomings or failures in our systems, risk management methodology, internal control processes or employee conduct.\n\nWe have specific operating standards and control processes to manage these risks, including guidelines specific to trading, and seek to monitor compliance through our dedicated compliance teams. We also seek to maintain a positive and collaborative relationship with regulators and the industry at large.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\nThe risks discussed below, separately or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the implementation of our strategy, our business, financial performance, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, prospects, shareholder value and returns and reputation.\n\n## Strategic and commercial risks\n\n## Prices and markets\n\n- - our financial performance is impacted by fluctuating prices of oil, gas and refined products, technological change, exchange rate fluctuations, and the general macroeconomic outlook.\n\nOil, gas and product prices are subject to international supply and demand and margins can be volatile.\n\nPolitical developments, increased supply from new oil and gas or alternative low carbon energy sources, technological change, global economic conditions, public health situations (including the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future epidemic or pandemic), the introduction of new carbon costs and the influence of OPEC+ can impact supply and demand and prices for our products.\n\nDecreases in oil, gas or product prices could have an adverse effect on revenue, margins, profitability and cash flows. If these reductions are significant or for a prolonged period, we may have to write down assets and reassess the viability of certain projects, which may impact future cash flows, profit, capital expenditure, the ability to work within our financial frame and maintain our long-term investment programme. Conversely, an increase in oil, gas and product prices may not improve margin performance as there could be increased fiscal take, cost inflation and more onerous terms for access to resources. The profitability of our refining activities can be volatile, with periodic over-supply or supply tightness in regional markets and fluctuations in demand.\n\nExchange rate fluctuations can create currency exposures and impact underlying costs and revenues. Crude oil prices are generally set in US dollars, while products vary in currency. Many of our major project \uf0ab development costs are denominated in local currencies, which may be subject to fluctuations against the US dollar.\n\n## Accessing and progressing hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities\n\n- - inability to access and progress hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities could adversely affect delivery of our strategy.\n\nDelivery of our strategy depends partly on our ability to progress hydrocarbon resources from our existing portfolio and access new resources in our existing core regions. Our ability to progress upstream resources and develop technologies at a level in line with our strategic outlook for hydrocarbon production could impact our future production and financial performance. Furthermore, our ability to access low carbon opportunities and the commercial terms associated with those opportunities could impact our financial performance and the pace of our transition to an integrated energy company in line with our strategy.\n\n## Major project delivery\n\n- - failure to invest in the best opportunities or deliver major projects successfully could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nWe face challenges in developing major projects, particularly in geographically and technically challenging areas. Poor investment choice, efficiency or delivery, or operational challenges at any major project that underpins production or production growth, could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## Geopolitical\n\n- exposure to a range of political developments and consequent changes to the operating and regulatory environment could cause business disruption.\n\nWe operate and may seek new opportunities in countries, regions and cities where political, economic and social transition may take place. Political instability, changes to the regulatory environment or taxation, international trade disputes and barriers to free trade, international sanctions, expropriation or nationalization of property, civil strife, strikes, insurrections,\n\nacts of terrorism, acts of war and public health situations (including the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future epidemic or pandemic) may disrupt or curtail our operations, business activities or investments. These may in turn cause production to decline, limit our ability to pursue new opportunities, affect the recoverability of our assets and our related earnings and cash flow or cause us to incur additional costs, particularly due to the long-term nature of many of our projects and significant capital expenditure required.\n\nEvents in, or relating to Russia and the conflict in Ukraine, including trade restrictions, international sanctions or any other actions taken by governmental authorities or other relevant persons will adversely impact our income and investment in or relating to Russia and could impact our ability to exit our interests in Rosneft and our other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, and the value we can realise for those interests.\n\n## Liquidity, financial capacity and financial, including credit, exposure\n\n- - failure to work within our financial framework could impact our ability to operate and result in financial loss.\n\nFailure to accurately forecast or work within our financial framework could impact our ability to operate and result in financial loss. Trade and other receivables, including overdue receivables, may not be recovered, divestments may not be successfully completed and a substantial and unexpected cash call or funding request could disrupt our financial framework or overwhelm our ability to meet our obligations.\n\nAn event such as a significant operational incident, legal proceedings or a geopolitical event in an area where we have significant activities, could reduce our financial liquidity and our credit ratings. Credit rating downgrades could potentially increase financing costs and limit access to financing or engagement in our trading activities on acceptable terms, which could put pressure on the group's liquidity.",

        "page_content": "They could also potentially require the company to review the funding arrangements with the bp pension trustees. In the event of extended constraints on our ability to obtain financing, we could be required to reduce capital expenditure or increase asset disposals in order to provide additional liquidity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee Liquidity and capital resources, page 342 and Financial statements Note 28\n\n## Joint arrangements and contractors\n\n- varying levels of control over the standards, operations and compliance of our partners, contractors and sub-contractors could result in legal liability and reputational damage.\n\nWe conduct many of our activities through joint arrangements, associates or with contractors and sub-contractors where we may have limited influence and control over the performance of such operations.\n\nOur partners and contractors are responsible for the adequacy of their resources and capabilities. If these are found to be lacking, there may be financial, operational or safety exposures for bp. Should an incident occur in an operation that bp participates in, our partners and contractors may be unable or unwilling to fully compensate us against costs we may incur on their behalf or on behalf of the arrangement. Where we do not have operational control of a venture or direct oversight of contractor activity, we may still be pursued by regulators or claimants in the event of an incident.\n\n## Digital infrastructure, cyber security and data protection\n\n- breach or failure of our or third parties' digital infrastructure or cyber security, including loss or misuse of sensitive information could damage our operations, increase costs and damage our reputation.\n\nThe energy industry is subject to fast-evolving risks, including ransomware, from cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. Current geopolitical factors have increased these risks. There is also growing regulation around data protection and data privacy. A breach or failure of our or third parties' digital infrastructure including control systems - due to breaches of our cyber defences, or those of third parties, negligence, intentional misconduct or other reasons, could seriously disrupt our operations. This could result in the loss or misuse of data or\n\nsensitive information, including employees' and customers' personal data, injury to people, disruption to our business, harm to the environment or our assets, legal or regulatory breaches, legal liability and significant costs including fines, cost of remediation or reputational consequences. Furthermore, the rapid detection of attempts to gain unauthorized access to our digital infrastructure, often through the use of sophisticated and co-ordinated means, is a challenge and any delay or failure to detect could compound these potential harms.\n\n## Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\n- developments in policy, law, regulation, technology and markets, including societal and investor sentiment, related to the issue of climate change could increase costs, reduce revenues, constrain our operations and affect our business plans and financial performance.\n\nLaws, regulations, policies, obligations, government actions, social attitudes and customer preferences relating to climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy, including the pace of change to any of these factors, and also the pace of the transition itself, could have adverse impacts on our business including on our access to and realization of competitive opportunities in any of our strategic focus areas, a decline in demand for, or constraints on our ability to sell certain products, constraints on production and supply, adverse litigation and regulatory or litigation outcomes, increased costs from compliance and increased provisions for environmental and legal liabilities.\n\nInvestor preferences and sentiment are influenced by environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) considerations including climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. Changes in those preferences and sentiment could affect our access to capital markets and our attractiveness to potential investors, potentially resulting in reduced access to financing, increased financing costs and impacts upon our business plans and financial performance.\n\nTechnological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lower carbon economy, and customer preferences or regulatory incentives that alter fuel or power choices, could impact demand for oil and gas.\n\nDepending on the nature and speed of any such changes and our response, these changes\n\ncould increase costs, reduce our profitability, reduce demand for certain products, limit our access to new opportunities, require us to write down certain assets or curtail or cease certain operations, and affect investor sentiment, our access to capital markets, our competitiveness and financial performance.\n\nPolicy, legal regulatory, technological and market developments related to climate change could also affect future price assumptions used in the assessment of recoverability of asset carrying values including goodwill, the judgement as to whether there is continued intent to develop exploration and appraisal intangible assets, the timing of decommissioning of assets and the useful economic lives of assets used for the calculation of depreciation and amortization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee Climate-related financial disclosures, page 55 and Financial statements Note 1\n\n## Competition\n\n- inability to remain efficient, maintain a high-quality portfolio of assets and innovate could negatively impact delivery of our strategy in a highly competitive market.\n\nOur strategic progress and performance could be impeded if we are unable to control our development and operating costs and margins, if we fail to scale our businesses at pace, or to sustain, develop and operate a high-quality portfolio of assets efficiently. Furthermore, as we transition from an international oil company to an integrated energy company, we face an expanded and rapidly evolving range of competitors in the sectors in which we operate. We could be adversely affected if competitors offer superior terms for access rights or licences, or if our innovation in areas such as new low carbon technologies, digital, customer offer, exploration, production, refining, manufacturing or renewable energy lags behind those of our competitors. Our performance could also be negatively impacted if we fail to protect our intellectual property.\n\n## Talent and capability\n\n- inability to attract, develop and retain people with necessary skills and capabilities could negatively impact delivery of our strategy.\n\nThe sectors in which we operate face increasing challenges to attract and retain diverse, skilled and capable talent. An inability to successfully recruit, develop and retain core skills and capabilities and to reskill existing talent could negatively impact delivery of our strategy.",

        "page_content": "## How we manage risk and risk factors continued\n\n## Crisis management and business continuity\n\n- - failure to address an incident effectively could potentially disrupt our business.\n\nOur business activities could be disrupted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any major crisis or if we are not able to restore or replace critical operational capacity.\n\n## Insurance\n\n- - our insurance strategy could expose the group to material uninsured losses.\n\nbp generally purchases insurance only in situations where this is legally and contractually required. Some risks are insured with third parties and reinsured by group insurance companies. Uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, particularly if they arise at a time when we are facing material costs as a result of a significant operational event which could put pressure on our liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## Safety and operational risks\n\n## Process safety, personal safety, and environmental risks\n\n- - exposure to a wide range of health, safety, security and environmental risks could cause harm to people, the environment and our assets and result in regulatory action, legal liability, business interruption, increased costs, damage to our reputation and potentially denial of our licence to operate.\n\nTechnical integrity failure, natural disasters, extreme weather or a change in its frequency or severity, human error and other adverse events or conditions, including breach of digital security, could lead to loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials. This could also lead to constrained availability of resources used in our operating activities, as well as fires, explosions or other personal and process safety incidents, including when drilling wells, operating facilities and those associated with transportation by road, sea or pipeline. There can be no certainty that our operating management system \uf0ab or other policies and procedures will adequately identify all process safety, personal safety and environmental risks or that all our operating activities, including acquired businesses, will be conducted in conformance with these systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See Safety, page 69\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuch events or conditions, including a marine incident, or inability to provide safe environments for our workforce and the public while at our facilities, premises or during transportation, could lead to injuries, loss of life or environmental damage. As a result we could face regulatory action and legal liability, including penalties and remediation obligations, increased costs and potentially denial of our licence to operate. Our activities are sometimes conducted in hazardous, remote or environmentally sensitive locations, where the consequences of such events or conditions could be greater than in other locations.\n\n## Drilling and production\n\n- challenging operational environments and other uncertainties could impact drilling and production activities.\n\nOur activities require high levels of investment and are sometimes conducted in challenging environments such as those prone to natural disasters and extreme weather, which heightens the risks of technical integrity failure. The physical characteristics of an oil or natural gas field, and cost of drilling, completing or operating wells is often uncertain. We may be required to curtail, delay or cancel drilling operations or stop production because of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in geological formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions and compliance with governmental requirements.\n\n## Security\n\n- - hostile acts against our employees and activities could cause harm to people and disrupt our operations.\n\nActs of terrorism, piracy, sabotage and similar activities directed against our operations and facilities, pipelines, transportation or digital infrastructure could cause harm to people and severely disrupt operations. Our activities could also be severely affected by conflict, civil strife or political unrest.\n\n## Product quality\n\n- - supplying customers with off-specification products could damage our reputation, lead to regulatory action and legal liability, and impact our financial performance.\n\nFailure to meet product quality specifications could cause harm to people and the environment, damage our reputation, result in regulatory action and legal liability, and impact financial performance.",

In relation to trade restrictions or other sanctions, current geopolitical factors have increased these risks.\n\n## Regulation\n\n- changes in the law and regulation could increase costs, constrain our operations and affect our business plans and financial performance.\n\nOur businesses and operations are subject to the laws and regulations applicable in each country, state or other regional or local area in which they occur. These laws and regulations result in an often complex, uncertain and changing legal and regulatory environment for our global businesses and operations. Changes in laws or regulations, including how they are interpreted and enforced, can and does impact all aspects of our business.\n\nRoyalties and taxes, particularly those applied to our hydrocarbon activities, tend to be high compared with those imposed on similar commercial activities. In certain jurisdictions there is also a degree of uncertainty relating to tax law interpretation and changes. Governments may change their fiscal and regulatory frameworks in response to public pressure on finances, resulting in increased\n\namounts payable to them or their agencies.\n\nChanges in law or regulation could increase the compliance and litigation risk and costs, reduce our profitability, reduce demand for or constrain our ability to sell certain products, limit our access to new opportunities, require us to divest or write down certain assets or curtail or cease certain operations, or affect the adequacy of our provisions for pensions, tax, decommissioning, environmental and legal liabilities. Changes in laws or regulations could result in the nationalization, expropriation, cancellation, nonrenewal or renegotiation of our interests, assets and related rights. Potential changes to pension or financial market regulation could also impact funding requirements of the group. Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, we may be subjected to a higher level of fines or penalties imposed in relation to any alleged breaches of laws or regulations, which could result in increased costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee Regulation of the group's business, page 356\n\n## Trading and treasury trading activities\n\n- ineffective oversight of trading and treasury trading activities could lead to business disruption, financial loss, regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation and affect our permissions to trade.\n\nWe are subject to operational risk around our trading and treasury trading activities in financial and commodity markets, some of which are regulated. Failure to process, manage and monitor a large number of complex transactions across many markets and currencies while complying with all regulatory requirements could hinder profitable trading opportunities. There is a risk that a single trader or a group of traders could act outside of our delegations and controls, leading to regulatory intervention and resulting in financial loss, fines and potentially damaging our reputation, and could affect our permissions to trade.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting\n\n- failure to accurately report our data could lead to regulatory action, legal liability and reputational damage.\n\nExternal reporting of financial and non-financial data, including reserves estimates, relies on the integrity of the control environment, our systems and people operating them. Failure to report data accurately and in compliance with applicable standards could result in regulatory action, legal liability and damage to our reputation.",

Within just a few weeks of bp launching its new direction, the world was struck by a global pandemic. As we said in last year's annual report, it was a period in which the board felt especially keenly its responsibilities for overseeing the delivery of the new strategy and for monitoring the performance of the new organization.\n\nTurning to 2021, this was a year of further change - the reinvention of bp, helping to ensure that we have the right skills and capabilities in support of the energy transition, while delivering on our investor proposition and increasing distributions to shareholders. At the beginning of the year, we put in place a new governance framework underpinning the board's role and its responsibilities to its shareholders. Founded upon four pillars - Strategy, People, Performance, and Governance - this new framework has stood up well against the challenges of the pandemic and a rapidly evolving and increasingly complex external environment.\n\nCommissioning an independent effectiveness review of the board in 2021 provided an objective view of the performance of the board operating against that framework. It proposed some areas for focus as we seek to continue modernizing our approach. Details are set out on page 104.\n\nIn February 2022, bp's governance was tested once again, this time by Russia's attack on Ukraine. Within days of military action, the board had met, undertaken a thorough process of review, and after careful consideration announced bp's decision to exit from its shareholding of Rosneft in Russia. bp's governance framework provided the clarity and flexibility we needed to act decisively and promptly, having satisfied ourselves that to do so was in the long-term interests of the company's shareholders.\n\n## Extensive engagement\n\nOne of the privileges of serving on bp's board is being able to meet such a variety of people, with different roles, backgrounds and experiences, and in so many places around the world - inside and outside bp.\n\nOur formal engagement programme allowed the board to meet people based in the tropical rainforests of West Papua, the Abu Dhabi desert, our US retail stations, a refinery in Spain, and our Indian offices - to highlight just a fraction. These were mostly digital meetings, but the gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions opened opportunities to visit bp's new EV charging infrastructure on London's Park Lane, colleagues in front-line roles during a visit to Aberdeen, and representatives from the local community surrounding our proposed low carbon hydrogen projects on Teesside in England.\n\nOur investors are also a vital part of bp's community. We have spent a great deal of time with them, seeking their views on matters ranging from our climate strategy to board governance, diversity and to remuneration. Discussion with our investors ultimately helped to inform the adjustments we announced to some of our net zero aims on 8 February 2022, and our decision to offer shareholders a vote on bp Net zero ambition report . We are hugely grateful for these important engagement opportunities.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nOne of the most striking conversations we had in 2021 was with a range of UK and US colleagues representing ethnic minority groups. Hearing people, some of whom had worked with bp for more than 20 years, reflect on changing attitudes over that period was enlightening, but also encouraging. It was clear that there is still work to do in improving diversity and promoting inclusion across bp.",

I believe board diversity matters; it sets the tone for the rest of the organization and allows us to draw upon a variety of experiences and perspectives.\n\nI am pleased that bp's board already meets the FTSE Women Leaders Review targets of 40% for representation of women and a female appointed to the position of senior independent director. We have also met the Parker Review's target for black and minority ethnic directors. But I believe bp should consider all dimensions of diversity. Our new diversity policy sets a standard from which we will build. It will see the board encouraging an inclusive environment and overseeing a diverse succession pipeline - among other important commitments.\n\nIn addition, bp has expanded its gender ambition to cover all levels of the business and the board will oversee bp's progress.\n\nThe board has also increased its focus on the talent management and development of all bp's people.\n\n## Evolution of board\n\nDuring 2021, we said goodbye to two longstanding board members who served bp and its shareholders with distinction. Professor Dame Ann Dowling and Brendan Nelson stood down after nine and 11 dedicated years' service, respectively. We are grateful to Brendan for continuing beyond the nine-year tenure to properly hand over his role as chair of the audit committee to Tushar Morzaria.\n\nWe were pleased to welcome Karen Richardson and Johannes Teyssen to the board. Karen has brought exceptional knowledge of technology, start-ups and cybersecurity, and a digital mindset honed during a career in Silicon Valley. Johannes's long experience leading one of Europe's largest energy companies means he brings deep and valued knowledge of our sector and its continuing transformation.\n\n## Closing thanks\n\nMany people contributed to bp's success in 2021 - our suppliers, our strategic partners, and, of course, our customers. It would be impossible to thank everyone, but I do want to mention three groups.\n\nFirst, I am deeply grateful to bp's investors, especially those of you who in 2021 shared your views on bp's direction, whether through voting, in writing, or in conversation with the board. We look forward to repaying the faith you have placed in this company. Second, my fellow directors. They have made a strong contribution to bp through a challenging period. Third, Bernard and his leadership team, for all they have achieved so far, and for how they have achieved it - with characteristic determination. But perhaps the greatest thanks should go to bp's people. I could not hope for a better team to entrust the challenge of reimagining energy for people and our planet. Thank you for all you do for bp.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nChair\n\n18 March 2022",

Despite these benefits, board members recognized that the optimum meeting format was in-person, as this maximized opportunities for interaction among board members, and also with the bp leadership team and the workforce more generally.\n\nThe ways of working we put in place in 2020 also carried on through 2021. Board meeting agendas continued to be structured along four distinct pillars: strategy, performance, people and governance, with the overarching focus being on monitoring strategic progress and performance as bp transforms into an integrated energy company.\n\nPrimary tasks of the board during 2021 included:\n\n## \u00b7 Oversight of strategic progress:\n\nThe board continued to monitor and oversee the activities and performance of bp's leadership team in delivering against the targets and aims that we communicated to the market in 2020. This was the second year of strategy execution since bp announced its transformative net zero ambition.\n\n## \u00b7 People:\n\nThroughout the year, the board reflected on key reinvent bp activities delivered in 2020 and 2021, including design and selection, health and wellbeing, management of change and employee engagement. The board was also consulted in the development of bp's new leadership framework, which seeks to enhance leaders' understanding of bp's expectations of them.\n\n## \u00b7 Value generation for shareholders:\n\nIn the second quarter, the board approved an increase in the resilient dividend of 4% per ordinary share and in addition, the commencement of share buybacks from first half surplus cash flow, taking into account factors including the cumulative level of and outlook for surplus cash flow, the cash balance point and maintenance of a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nBuilding on work undertaken to establish bp's purpose and strategy in 2020, the board's approach was informed by output from the 2020 board effectiveness review. This was underpinned by the strength of relationship with the CEO and his leadership team to monitor and oversee progress against the targets and aims set out in 2020. This was undertaken through a comprehensive schedule of thematic deep-dives and business reviews including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Convenience & mobility, with particular focus on electrification and next generation mobility.\n- \u00b7 Resilient hydrocarbons and options to high-grade the portfolio while lowering emissions.\n- \u00b7 The value of integration in creating value as bp participates across the value chain, de-risking cash flows and customer success.\n- \u00b7 Low carbon energy and the acceleration of bp's participation in the renewables sector, with particular focus on wind and solar.\n- \u00b7 Other strategic reflections since the September 2020 capital markets day.\n\nThrough these engagements, the board supported and provided guidance to management. For more information see Decision-making by the board on page 97.\n\nSustainability continued to be a key area of focus for the board in 2021. The board reviewed the environment, social and governance landscape, noting the importance of steps that management was taking to deliver the sustainability framework, announced in September 2020. The importance of defining what bp stands for in sustainability and embedding this across the organization, while engaging with stakeholders was underscored. It was against this backdrop that the board approved an update to our sustainability framework, with five further aims to help improve people's lives and another five aims to care for our planet. Early in 2022, following on from board discussions during the fourth quarter of 2021, the board approved changes to bp's aims. Further information on these changes can be found on page 51.\n\nEarly in 2021, demonstrating the new governance framework in action, the board supported a request from management to bid for up to 3GW (1.5GW net to bp) of offshore wind capacity in the UK's Offshore Wind Round 4, together with EnBW (through a 50/50 joint venture). This project aligns with bp's net zero ambitions, including bp's aims to have increased its annual low carbon investment to around $5 billion a year by 2030, as well as achieving 50GW of developed renewables to final investment decision by 2030, contributing 1.5GW.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance\n\nThe board reviewed project, operational and safety performance throughout the year, as well as a retrospective look at the full-year delivery against plan. The company's financial performance, liquidity, credit position and associated financial risks were closely and regularly monitored by the board.\n\nInputs that assisted the board in discharging its oversight of performance included reports from the CEO and CFO, quarterly and full-year results, and the annual plan and associated capital allocation commitments.",

The board also approved at the time of our third quarter results that, based on bp's current forecasts, at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board's discretion each quarter, bp expected to be able to deliver buybacks of around $1.0 billion per quarter and have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4% through 2025.\n\nAs required under the UK Corporate Governance Code, the board carried out a robust assessment of bp's emerging and principal risks. Following this assessment, the board approved a new framework for the oversight of principal risks by the board and its committees. The new approach creates a clearer linkage between bp's underlying risk profile and its principal risks.\n\nOn internal controls, the board assessed the effectiveness of the group's system of internal control and risk management as part of the process through which it reviews and ultimately, approves the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F . No specific areas were identified in this assessment. The board concluded that the\n\ngroup's system of internal control continued to be resilient. The board also concluded that the overall design of the group's system of internal control generally meets external expectations of components to be included in internal control frameworks. In arriving at these conclusions, the board took into account reports from group risk and internal audit, as well as deep-dives and business reviews undertaken by the board and its committees during the year. For more information on bp's system of risk management see How we manage risk on page 73. Information about bp's system of internal control is on page 142.\n\n## People\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout 2021, the board, through its people & governance committee, discussed key people priorities. This included bp's journey to reinvent bp, a continued focus on employee engagement and management's early thinking on how bp will develop high performing, inspiring leaders under a proposed leadership framework that is being developed by management.\n\nThe board received direct updates during the year on reinvent bp as well as leadership development and succession planning. It was recognized that bp's talent management arrangements would need to evolve as the organization continues to deliver against its stated net zero ambitions and aims. This included the recruitment of new talent from outside the organization, to drive growth and innovation in pivotal areas such as digital, mobility and convenience and low carbon energy.\n\nThe board considered and approved the adoption of the 'alternative arrangements' method as its workforce engagement mechanism for 2021. To help inform board discussions and decisions and in line with these arrangements, board members engaged directly with the workforce in various events as set out on page 95.\n\nDiversity continued to be a key area of focus during 2021. As stated in the board's terms of reference which became effective in January 2021, the board developed and approved a new board diversity, equity and inclusion policy. The policy contains statements which align to the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code alongside aspirational targets for board diversity. A copy of the policy is available on our website, bp.com/governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Governance\n\nDuring 2021, the board embedded the governance framework that it established in 2020. For more information on this framework, see page 92. Under the leadership of the board chair and the people & governance committee, an externally facilitated evaluation of the board was conducted in 2021. For more information on the board evaluation, see page 102.",

These are the safety and sustainability committee, audit committee, people and governance committee and remuneration committee.\n\nThe terms of reference for the board (including matters reserved for the board) and the board committees together with the role profiles of the chair, CEO and senior independent director can be found on bp.com/investors .\n\n## Delegation and matters reserved\n\nThe board delegates day-to-day management of the business of the company to the CEO, save for those matters which are reserved for the board's approval and cannot be delegated. The matters reserved include:\n\n- \u00b7 Entry into new countries\n- \u00b7 Cessation of all or any material part of bp's operating activities in a country\n- \u00b7 Changes to the company's capital structure\n- \u00b7 Distributions\n- \u00b7 Changes to the company's code of conduct.\n\nThe board reviews and approves capital expenditure over $3 billion for resilient hydrocarbons and over $1 billion for all transition or low carbon investments \uf0ab . In addition, it reviews any significant inorganic acquisition that is exceptional or unique in nature.\n\n## Annual review\n\nFollowing an annual review of the governance framework, amendments were made to reflect evolving trends externally as well as bp's own governance needs.\n\nThe main amendment was to make clear reference to climate-related risks and opportunities in light of the increasing profile and significance of such risks and opportunities in bp's strategy and the formal introduction of requirements to make climate related financial disclosures consistent with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations and recommended disclosures on a 'comply or explain' basis. The amendments enhance bp's corporate governance framework addressing such risks and opportunities explicitly rather than implicitly. This transparency of the complementary accountabilities of the board, its committees and the CEO is in line with bp's aim 9 to be recognized as an industry leader for the transparency of our reporting.\n\n## Governance framework\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## How the board has engaged with shareholders, the workforce and other stakeholders\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nWe regularly engage with our institutional shareholders through an active investor relations programme including face-to-face or virtual meetings.\n\nThe board receives feedback from shareholders in many ways, including through the executive engagement led by the CEO and CFO, as well as other members of the leadership team. From a non-executive perspective, this engagement is primarily led by the chair. In 2021, he hosted several one-to-one meetings with major institutional investors and proxy advisory groups. These engagements generated valuable and insightful feedback which was shared with other board members and committees, as well as the executive management, and has helped to inform the formulation and execution of our strategy.\n\nDuring 2021, investor engagement by executive management focused on financial and business performance and the execution of the new strategy and its associated targets and aims. For the chair, this engagement covered board, governance, strategy (including bp's climate strategy), financial frame and people and succession topics. Additional information on investor engagement activity following the 2021 AGM is set out below.\n\n## Retail investors\n\nIn May we held our annual event for retail investors in conjunction with the UK Shareholders' Association (UKSA) and the UK Individual Shareholders Society. The chair, company secretary and SVP investor relations gave presentations on bp's annual results, strategy and the work of the board. Shareholder questions primarily focused on bp's sustainability strategy, financial frame and performance, as well as the resolutions proposed at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## AGM\n\nThe 2021 AGM was a hybrid meeting. In line with government rules at the time, attendance in person was limited to the directors and support staff only. Shareholders were able to submit questions before or during the meeting and\n\nparticipate by telephone to speak with the directors. The event was broadcast on bp.com , enabling non-bp shareholders to view the meeting. Shareholders who were not able to attend the meeting electronically were able to vote by proxy in the usual way.\n\nThe overall turnout was 58.7% of the total voting rights, including voting rights cast as withheld by the shareholder. This compares to 62.1% in 2020 and 67.1% in 2019. All resolutions were passed at the meeting in line with the board's recommendations.\n\nWe anticipate that the 2022 AGM will be a hybrid meeting, building on the successful format introduced in 2021 and allowing for wider shareholder participation. Shareholders will be able to attend the meeting via bp's electronic meeting platform or in person. Further details on how to join and participate in the meeting are set out in the notice of meeting, available on bp.com/agm .\n\n## Response to resolution 13 at the 2021 AGM\n\nResolution 13, a shareholder resolution on climate change targets, was not supported by the board. Shareholders strongly supported the board's recommendation to reject this resolution, but 20.65% of the votes cast still supported it. Despite the low level of shareholder support, bp recognizes that some shareholders chose to support the resolution.\n\nOn 2 December 2021 bp published its response to the vote on resolution 13 in accordance with Provision 4 of the UK Corporate Governance Code ('Code').\n\nThe response explained that extensive engagement with shareholders had been undertaken prior to the AGM and that this dialogue continued after the vote to better understand shareholders' views on bp's climate plans. Through the consultation bp gained valuable insights on the evolution of shareholders' views on strategy, targets and aims - irrespective of how they voted on resolution 13. The response was published a few weeks later than the 6 month period set out in the Code to allow for the extensive engagement process to be concluded.\n\nOverall, through our engagement activity, we heard clear support for our strategy. Shareholders told us they recognize the importance of maintaining a strategy that remains resilient to the risks and opportunities of the evolving energy transition and are encouraging bp to continue focusing on value-generating activities to fulfil our ambition to get to net zero by 2050 or sooner and to help the world get to net zero.\n\n## Net zero: from ambition to action\n\nSince the 2021 AGM, bp has seen the world's ambition accelerating. This, coupled with the insights gained from the consultation and our wider engagement with investors, has created an opportunity for us to raise our low carbon ambitions and we now aim to be net zero across operations, production and sales by 2050 or sooner. In addition, as announced on 8 February 2022, we intend to provide shareholders with the opportunity of an advisory vote on our net zero ambition report at the 2022 AGM. Further information, including the notice of meeting for the 2022 AGM, can be found on bp.com/agm.\n\n## Other stakeholders\n\nThe board received regular updates from the CEO and CFO and other members of the leadership team on engagements with other stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and governments and regulators.\n\nThe regular updates were considered as part of the board's formulation of bp's strategy. For example, as part of the decision-making process for the UK Offshore Wind Round 4 bid, the board received updates on community and environmental matters. For more information see page 97.\n\nThe board also received a report from ethics and compliance where any matters raised by external stakeholders were reported to the board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on our stakeholders see Business model, page 12\n\n<!-- image -->",

This programme was successfully delivered during 2021 allowing all board members to participate and hear the views of a wide range of workforce members. Further details of the programme are set out below.\n\nTo complement the programme, a range of other activities were undertaken throughout the year for the board to engage with members of the workforce. These included:\n\n- \u00b7 Receiving reports on key performance indicators on employee engagement, including voluntary attrition rates and engagement scores as measured by employee 'Pulse' surveys.\n\n- \u00b7 Receiving reports on Speak up, bp's anonymous whistleblowing service.\n- \u00b7 Site visits undertaken by the whole board as well as individual board members or small groups of directors e.g. the audit committee visit to the trading team at the Canary Wharf office, London and S&SC virtual site visit to Angola\n- \u00b7 CEO 'Keeping Connected' webcasts with approximately 3,000 colleagues joining each live webcast.\n- \u00b7 Town hall events hosted by bp chair Helge Lund including during his visit to Aberdeen.",

These individuals are spread across multiple jurisdictions and carry out a range of different roles, from our retail sites to our refineries to our offshore wind teams.\n\n## Board of directors\n\n## People and governance committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nall non-executive directors individually participate in the programme\n\n## Representation areas\n\n## Strategically relevant position e.g.\n\n- \u00b7  Digital/cyber security colleagues\n- \u00b7  Low carbon business representatives\n\n## Key features of the workforce engagement programme:\n\n## Rotating across different representation areas\n\nThe broad coverage achieved in hearing views from members of the workforce with diversity in representation of seniority, tenure with bp, business sector and geographic location to promote balance across the full range of bp's activities.\n\n## Involving every board member\n\nAllowing each board member to participate directly rather than first-hand insights being concentrated in one individual\n\n## 1 or 2 board members present\n\nMaximizes directors' time by allowing for the whole board to benefit from a greater number of sessions being held across the year.\n\n## Small group sessions with 10-12 participants\n\nProvides for a focused discussion with the opportunity for all voices present to be heard in a meaningful way.\n\n## Open and honest views encouraged\n\nSessions are 'unsupervised' i.e. without line managers/function leaders present in order to allow an unconstrained exchange of views.\n\n## Wide variety of topics covered\n\nEach session has a specific engagement purpose but not a set agenda in order to encourage free flowing discussion and the opportunity to explore specific points that may arise during the discussion itself.\n\n## Special interest groups e.g.\n\n- \u00b7  Graduate programme trainees\n- \u00b7  Business resource group representatives\n\n## Front-line workers e.g.\n\n- \u00b7  Retail convenience store managers\n- \u00b7  Refinery operations colleagues\n\n## Sessions are held throughout the year\n\nTakes account of different cycles of workstreams and provides a consistent flow of employee feedback for the board.\n\n## Focus on virtual attendance\n\nHaving a focus on sessions being held virtually allows colleagues to be drawn from across our global operations including remote locations with a parity of engagement exposure for all attendees.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nGiven the breadth and geographic diversity of our workforce, having this bespoke mechanism provides an effective way for directors to hear from a broad cross-section of our colleagues.\n\nThe programme is overseen by the people & governance committee which monitors the effectiveness of the programme and also undertakes an annual review to determine the optimum engagement mechanism for the board to use.",

        "page_content": "## Stakeholder engagement continued\n\n## Outcome of 2021 programme\n\nDuring 2021, all eight non-executive directors attended at least one session, engaging in meaningful dialogue with over 90 colleagues representing ten different jurisdictions. These colleagues were drawn from business areas covering all three of our strategic focus areas (resilient hydrocarbons, convenience & mobility and low carbon energy) as well as our integrator and enabler functions. Participants ranged in tenure from a few months to over 20 years' service including recent graduates as well as senior leaders.\n\nDespite the broad range of perspectives represented, it was clear from the feedback that there were common themes impacting individuals from across different business areas and locations, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 a sense of excitement about bp's new purpose of reimagining energy. Colleagues reported that this was helping to attract new talent that would not previously have considered joining our sector. Board members gained valuable insights into how, given the scale of the change across bp, some participants experienced challenges as the new strategy was being implemented;\n- \u00b7 the significance of supporting remote working arrangements following the COVID-19 pandemic and how this will impact our ongoing ability to retain and attract individuals;\n- \u00b7 front-line retail colleagues expressed pride in the way that bp enabled them to support local communities during the COVID-19 pandemic but highlighted how their depth of knowledge of local retail markets could be better\n\nleveraged when broad marketing campaigns were developed;\n\n- \u00b7 motivation levels among our low carbon colleagues are high with a recognition that building strong relationships with our partners will help accelerate this business area.\n\n## Linkage to board decisions\n\nThe board recognizes the value of having workforce views in advance of making decisions. In 2021, the board engaged with colleagues to gain a more holistic perspective of the impact of decisions taken. This helps inform the approach for future board decisions and places directors in a stronger position to constructively challenge management on the decisions that they take, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 the decision in 2020 to adopt a new strategy and purpose through the Reinvent bp programme. Board members heard from representatives of European Works Councils as well a cross-section of senior leaders to hear about the impact of this transition on delivery, workload and mental wellbeing. Given the open discussion approach used, the impact of the Reinvent bp programme was raised by colleagues at almost every session held in 2021 regardless of the topic of the session. This provided a broad view of the impact of the new strategy and purpose upon many different business areas from retail sites to offshore wind;\n- \u00b7 a session was held with members of our business resource groups that focus on ethnic diversity. These are employee-led groups offering support and networking opportunities to particular under-represented groups.\n\n## 2021 Workforce engagement programme\n\nImpact of the Reinvent bp programme: tier 2 leaders\n\nMelody Meyer held a session with a crosssection of our senior leadership group to learn about the impact of the transition to bp's new strategy and purpose on the functions they lead. Views were heard from leaders of our hydrocarbons businesses as well as our new low carbon areas and key enabler functions such as strategy, finance and digital. Among the topics discussed were:\n\n- \u00b7 How Reinvent bp has strengthened the ability to deliver with a renewed 'one team' mindset.\n- \u00b7 How Reinvent bp has amplified opportunities to offer diverse careers which harness our global capability.\n- \u00b7 Reflections on what has been learned through the Reinvent bp transition.\n\n- \u00b7 Opportunities to improve retention and also the attraction of new colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\njurisdictions (including Australia, Poland, Oman, Azerbaijan, Singapore and the US)\n\n10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsessions held\n\n9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncolleagues participated\n\n>90\n\nGroups from the UK and US joined a session in the same period that directors approved and published the board diversity policy. Feedback from this session highlighted how bp's support for under-represented groups had improved over the years but that there are more opportunities to continue to promote inclusion for all colleagues. These principles are reflected in the board diversity policy which seeks to improve diversity both at board level and also the pipeline of succession to the board;\n\n- \u00b7 the decisions taken to support retail customers and colleagues through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Review of engagement mechanism\n\nAfter the 2021 programme was completed, the P&GC reflected on its outcomes and effectiveness. A review was undertaken of the approach of other companies including a consideration of alternative options for engagement set out under the Code of a:\n\n- \u00b7 director appointed from the workforce;\n- \u00b7 formal workforce advisory panel; or,\n- \u00b7 designated non-executive director.\n\nIt was determined that the current approach remained best suited to the broad range of bp's workforce and was an effective alternative to the options set out in the Code.\n\n## Opportunities to refine:\n\nLooking ahead to the 2022 programme, a schedule has been developed which targets additional employee groups with a particular focus on understanding bp's culture. As set out on page 99, this will complement other measures to enhance the board's assessment of culture.\n\nHosting virtual sessions allowed for participants from different jurisdictions to be brought together so that they could benefit from hearing each other's views on specific topics. It is expected that the programme will continue on a predominantly virtual basis although some in-person sessions may also be arranged where there are recognized benefits.\n\nConsideration will be given to opportunities for engagement with non-English speakers e.g. through the use of interpreters.\n\nWhen new directors join the board, consideration will be given to the use of introductory profiles or videos to be placed on bp's intranet site so employees can learn more about the director and their role.",

Independence of non-executive directors (NEDs) is a crucial in bringing constructive challenge to the CEO and the leadership team at board meetings, while providing support and guidance to promote meaningful discussion and, ultimately, informed and effective decision-making. In addition, each director has a statutory duty to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIn accordance with the criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code), the chair was considered independent at the time he was appointed. NEDs are required to provide sufficient information to allow the board to evaluate their independence prior to and following their appointment.\n\n## Appointment and time commitment\n\nThe chair, senior independent director and other NEDs each have letters of appointment with BP p.l.c. and do not serve, nor are they employed, in any executive capacity by bp.\n\nNEDs are generally appointed for three-year fixed terms; however, in line with what is considered good governance practice, bp proposes all directors for annual re-election by shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM) where letters of appointment for each NED are available for inspection.\n\nDetails on the skills and experience of each director seeking re-election, as well as their individual contributions to the long-term success of the company, are set out in the notice of meeting. In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, NEDs would not be expected to serve beyond nine years unless there are exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Attendance\n\n|                            | Board   | Audit committee   | Safety and  sustainability  committee   | Remuneration  committee   | People and  governance  committee   |\n|----------------------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Non-executive directors    |         |                   |                                         |                           |                                     |\n| Helge Lund                 | 11/11\u00b7  |                   |                                         |                           | 4/4\u00b7                                |\n| Pamela Daley               | 11/11   | 9/9               |                                         | 6/6                       |                                     |\n| Professor Dame Ann Dowling | 5/5     |                   | 2/2                                     |                           |                                     |\n| Melody Meyer               | 11/11   |                   | 6/6\u00b7                                    | 6/6                       |                                     |\n| Tushar Morzaria            | 11/11   | 9/9\u00b7              |                                         | 6/6                       |                                     |\n| Brendan Nelson             | 5/5     | 3/3\u00b7              |                                         | 3/3                       | 2/2                                 |\n| Paula Reynolds             | 11/11   | 9/9               |                                         | 6/6\u00b7                      | 4/4                                 |\n| Karen Richardson           | 10/11   | 5/6               |                                         |                           |                                     |\n| Sir John Sawers            | 11/11   |                   | 6/6                                     |                           | 4/4                                 |\n| Johannes Teyssen           | 10/11   |                   | 6/6                                     |                           |                                     |\n| Executive directors        |         |                   |                                         |                           |                                     |\n| Murray Auchincloss         | 11/11   |                   |                                         |                           |                                     |\n| Bernard Looney             | 11/11   |                   |                                         |                           |                                     |\n\nAttended meetings/possible meetings \u2022  Chair of board/committee\n\nOf the 11 board meetings held in 2021, six were board meetings covering a full agenda across strategy, performance, people and governance. Four board meetings were focused on the quarterly results and one board meeting was solely focused on discussing the board evaluation.\n\nKaren and Johannes were unable to attend one board meeting each due to commitments made prior to their appointments to bp's board.\n\nDuring 2021, the board reviewed the process for declaration, review and authorization of conflicts of interest for directors. Formal procedures are in place for new potential conflicts to be reported and recorded during the year.\n\nAs a consequence of regular reviews in 2021, the board is satisfied that there were no matters giving rise to conflicts of interest which could not be authorized by the board. It has therefore concluded that all bp NEDs are independent.",

        "page_content": "On behalf of the board, the people and governance committee reviews the formal appointment process and succession plan. Appointments and succession plans are both based on merit and assessed against objective criteria with the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion as central considerations. This includes diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds as well as cognitive and personal strengths. In reviewing appointments and succession plans, due consideration is given to ensure smooth transition of board members with specific responsibilities (e.g. committee chair roles) by allowing sufficient time for a detailed handover. This is balanced by the need to have new board members join at regular intervals such that over time there is a controlled approach to board members reaching the end of their tenure. This was reflected in the handover from Brendan Nelson as chair of the audit committee to Tushar Morzaria. Notwithstanding that Brendan had reached the end of nine years' service as a bp director, it was deemed appropriate for Brendan to extend his tenure in order to have a thorough handover with Tushar.\n\nFurther details on succession and tenure are set out in the people and governance committee report on page 104.\n\nThe expectation regarding time commitment for board members to effectively discharge their duties is set out in the directors' letters of appointment. The time commitment varies with the demands of bp business and other events. In practice, in 2020 and 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company, as well as the need for the board to oversee the execution of bp's new strategy, resulted in the NEDs spending additional time fulfilling their responsibilities.\n\nThe NEDs' external time commitments whether through executive, non-executive, advisory or other roles - are regularly reviewed by the company secretary to ensure that, even in the exceptional circumstances of a global pandemic, they are able to allocate appropriate time to bp. The review process takes into account outside appointments and other external commitments, factoring in the complexity of the company in question and the industry, in particular regulated and potentially competing sectors.\n\nNEDs are also required to consult with the company secretary and chair before accepting any other role that may impact their ability to commit appropriate time to bp. During 2021, the process for approval of all new external appointments of existing directors was refreshed. In addition to reviewing the time commitment required for the new external appointments to ensure the director has sufficient capacity for their role with bp, a review of independence and potential conflicts of interest is now also undertaken at the same time.\n\nThe board has concluded that, notwithstanding the NEDs' other appointments, they are each able to dedicate sufficient time to fulfil their bp duties.\n\nAs recommended by the Code, neither of the executive directors hold more than one nonexecutive directorship in a FTSE 100 company or other significant appointments, as set out on pages 84-87.\n\n## Diversity and culture\n\nThe board is fully supportive of bp's UK, US and global frameworks for action which set out how we will advance and integrate diversity, equity and inclusion across our regions and the global businesses. These frameworks include three pillars -transparency, accountability and the development and attraction of diverse talent.\n\nThe board believes that better decision-making and better overall outcomes can be achieved when people from different backgrounds with different perspectives come together with a common ambition. The board supports a culture of inclusion where everyone is valued and able to play their part in building the success of our company.\n\nFurther details on our approach to diversity and the board's diversity, equity and inclusion policy can be found on bp.com and in the people and governance committee report on page 106.\n\nCulture is monitored by the board through a number of mechanisms. These include reviews by the people and governance committee of bp's ways of working, regular updates from the EVP people and culture, information from employee pulse surveys and feedback from both the NED workforce engagement sessions and the global engagement sessions led by the CEO, such as 'Keeping Connected'. Alongside these mechanisms there are formal and informal channels for employees to raise concerns and significant concerns and insights are shared as part of the ethics and compliance update at the safety and sustainability committee.\n\nThe board considers all these measures alongside the implementation of our DE&I policies to help satisfy itself that bp's culture is and remains aligned to its purpose, strategy and values.\n\nTo further enhance the board's assessment of culture, plans are being developed for the various data points and reporting measures to be brought together in one place. It is expected that this will complement the approach for workforce engagement in 2022 where a specific focus on culture has been introduced.\n\nOur workforce engagement programme (further details set out on pages 95-96 already provides our directors with valued insights directly from our colleagues through small group sessions across the organization. Questions can also be tailored to each engagement session for directors to raise with participants. These questions will be aimed at stimulating discussion and drawing out individuals' own experience of bp's culture in their particular part of the business. In this way, the board will have the opportunity to gain a perspective beyond the facts and figures, which provide a useful statistical view of cultural measures, and hear how bp's culture is operating in practice.",

        "page_content": "## Induction of new directors, continuing learning and development\n\nFollowing the announcement of a new director's appointment to the board, a structured and wide-ranging induction programme is compiled. This reflects their individual needs, to help ensure that they are best placed to maximize their contribution to and effectiveness on the board. In 2021, following their appointment to the board, tailored induction programmes were put together for Karen Richardson and Johannes Teyssen (see opposite).\n\nFollowing appointment, the skills and experience of individual board members are routinely reviewed to ensure that they continue to be well placed to assess and inform the evolution of bp's strategy and purpose, while scrutinizing and holding to account the performance of the leadership team against agreed performance objectives. This review process is also informed by the chair's individual meetings with the directors and the outputs from the annual effectiveness review process. Together, these steps help to identify learning and development opportunities to plug identified gaps or to provide deeper educational dives into new and evolving business areas.\n\n## Activities during the year\n\nLearning and development activity is divided between developmental and educational needs, mandatory training (being training that all bp employees undertake such as code of conduct and cyber risk, among others) and site visits.\n\nDuring 2021, the board participated in several developmental briefings hosted by subject matter experts to deepen their understanding of their areas of focus. A deep-dive was held on the opportunity presented by growing momentum in the development of renewable energy sources, and how bp is positioned to play an increasingly significant role in this space through its ongoing transformation to become an integrated energy company.\n\n## Board induction programme\n\nA formal and comprehensive induction is provided to all directors following their appointment. Karen Richardson and Dr Johannes Teyssen, appointed on 1 January 2021, undertook robust and tailored inductions including meetings with a wide range of senior management within bp and key external advisors. The importance of the induction\n\ncannot be overstated: it is one of the key mechanisms to support directors in meeting their statutory duties, embedding their understanding of bp's strategic priorities and bringing the board closer to decision-makers and those tasked with the day-to-day management of the business. A selection of these activities is outlined below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Before arrival and within the first month\n\n- \u00b7 Introductory meetings with the chair and group company secretary, covering an overview of board and committee matters, priority areas for the board, the governance framework and bp's corporate structure\n- \u00b7 Pre-read of board and relevant committee papers from the previous 12 months\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Within the first three months\n\n- \u00b7 Introductions with leadership team members, providing an overview of their business unit and subject matter expertise\n- \u00b7 Meetings with relevant committee chairs and members to understand ways of working and priority areas\n- \u00b7 Teach-ins on topics of strategic importance\n- \u00b7 Briefings from key external advisors on legal, regulatory, audit, finance and other matters\n\nMandatory training sessions were provided on sustainability, ethics and compliance, and directors undertook site visits and meetings with key colleagues to develop their knowledge of bp's strategy and operations.\n\nDespite the challenges of the global pandemic, creative approaches were taken to provide immersive training for board members without the need to travel to the site in question.\n\nFurther details are set out below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## developmental briefings\n\n10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsite visits (in person and virtual)\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Employee engagement session to enable direct feedback opportunities from the workforce to the board\n- \u00b7 Visit to a bp site, which is facilitated virtually where an in-person visit is not possible",

It hasn't been without challenge: the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic meant in-person meetings weren't always possible, though the digital solutions deployed throughout the process to facilitate meaningful engagement were excellent. I was delighted to be able to visit bp's security operations centre in Houston, Texas during 2021 and look forward to further site visits during 2022 and beyond to continue developing my understanding of bp's operations.\n\n## Karen Richardson\n\nIndependent non-executive director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe digital skills programme has successfully raised the profile of bp's digital strategy. Deep-dives with subject matter experts created rich two-way discussions which, alongside comprehensive e-learning content, helped to develop board members' understanding of key digital topic areas.

Each quarter, directors were offered virtual learning content and invited to participate in a discussion with a relevant subject matter experts across four distinct topic areas: digital foundations, digital mindset, emerging digital technology and transformational digital technology.\n\nIn addition, board members were provided reverse mentoring opportunities with finalyear graduates from bp's innovation & engineering team. In these sessions, digital topics were explored further in order to gain a fresh perspective on digital fluency.\n\nCorporate governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

There have been improvements in the quality and cadence of information flows from management to the board, a risk governance review has been completed and board education sessions have been directed at strategic priorities, such as the emerging renewables and low carbon energy businesses, climate change risk and how bp is mitigating it consistent with its financial and sustainability aims. Board and committee time has been optimized and co-ordinated through board roadmaps and the board and committees' terms of reference.\n\nEvery third year, recommended practice is for the board evaluation to be externally facilitated. Having completed two annual cycles of internallyfacilitated reviews, the people and governance committee oversaw the review process for 2021, including the appointment of an independent provider of board review services.\n\nGiven the significant strategic progress by bp since 2020, the new leadership and organization that is now in place and the roll-out of bp's new corporate governance framework, a specialist board review firm was considered the best option to provide an objective perspective on the progress made by the board over this period.\n\nFollowing a request for proposal process, bp selected Independent Board Evaluation to complete an external board evaluation. There is no connection between Independent Board Evaluation and either bp or the directors. The process followed in the evaluation is set out in the graphic to the right.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The evaluation supported an overall view that the board performs at a high level. It is focused and engaged, takes effectiveness in governance very seriously and works well with the leadership team. The recommendations made aim to help the board towards optimal effectiveness.\n\nThe board agreed to implement actions across three areas:\n\nStrategy and performance: The board's overarching focus through 2021 has been on monitoring strategic progress and performance as bp transforms into an integrated energy company. As we move from setting a new strategic direction in 2020, to our re-invention in 2021, 2022 will be about delivery of that strategy. Accordingly, there will be an increasing focus at board meetings on the journey of each of the businesses to deliver the targets and aims that have been set. The leadership team is being encouraged to engage with the board, to take soundings, to build credible and enduring relationships and to use time with the board to bring ideas before they are fully developed. This will help provide greater awareness of the risks and opportunities that are considered, alternative options, while also bringing their experience to the decision-making process.\n\nPeople and culture: Throughout 2021 we have made significant progress on employee engagement with our NEDs, through the structured workforce programme. The chair has also attended drop-ins with the business and other teams.\n\nComplementing this will be a gradual return to the board's (and committees') practice of in-person site visits to allow for more in person engagement opportunities. In addition to the reverse digital mentoring, we will evaluate other relationship and networking opportunities outside the formality of the boardroom such as informal breakfasts/dinners with some of the leadership team and those employees identified as having the talent to become part of the leadership team over time.\n\nGovernance and reporting: Recommendations to improve the end-to-end board experience and flow of information are being progressed. In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Further improving the information flows between the board and management through a common frame for board papers.\n- \u00b7 Adjusting the timing and allocation of time to the CEO and CFO's report, the committee sessions and the committee feedback so that those matters which are of most importance to bp are raised.\n\nFeedback from the evaluation for the committees was considered at each of the committees and the chair held sessions with each director to discuss their individual feedback.\n\nIn February 2022, the senior independent director led a meeting with the NEDs without the chair present to provide board members with an opportunity to provide any feedback regarding his performance. Strong support for the continued leadership shown by the chair and his engagement with the CEO, CFO and other members of the bp leadership team was provided and relayed by the senior independent director.",

Our focus in 2021 has been across three areas: Overseeing the organizational change resulting from the Reinvent bp programme; providing guidance around a new leadership frame for bp and progressing the design and roll-out of a robust framework for talent management; and the continuing refresh of the board, ensuring we have the right skills, experience, and diversity around the board table to deliver our strategy.\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nCommittee chair\n\n## Activities during the year\n\n## Overseeing organizational change\n\nAs part of our oversight responsibility on work force engagement and culture we put in place new ground rules for engagement in line with applicable corporate governance rules. We also took a retrospective look at bp's reinvent journey to ensure that the organization had maintained its focus on safety in its successful delivery of a new structure, a new leadership team, and new ways of working (with the committee reviewing the processes and procedures in place for the adoption of agile working).\n\n## New leadership frame\n\nWe provided guidance on the new leadership frame further to an assessment of the core leadership principles and provided oversight on its submission to the board and implementation with a detailed section on page 90. We reviewed the new board governance framework to ensure that bp continues to maintain the highest standards of board and committee governance. Additionally, and as part of this work, we engaged an external provider to complete a detailed board effectiveness review with a detailed summary together with recommendations on page 102.",

The new board members bring extensive financial, technological, transformation and energy industry experience to the board and ensure that a strong focus on strategic execution, safety and sustainability and connectivity to bp's core businesses and markets continues.\n\nUnder its new terms of reference, the committee has responsibility for identifying and articulating the objectives and criteria of any board appointment process. This is based upon requirements identified from a review of the experience, skills and diversity of background of the board and its committees. For executive directors, the committee gives consideration to existing succession plans.\n\nThe committee is responsible for engaging an independent executive search consultant, who assists in preparing shortlists of candidates, co-ordinating interviews and seeking references. In accordance with the board diversity, equity and inclusion policy (DE&I policy), the committee engages with external search firms who are able to align with bp's approach to diversity, equity and inclusion in identifying suitable individuals from diverse pools of candidates.\n\nDuring 2021, the committee engaged with Egon Zehnder, MWM Consulting and Spencer Stuart in support of its ongoing search for new board candidates.  Egon Zehnder and Spencer Stuart also provide advice and support on executive recruitment matters to bp.\n\nIt is expected that all members of the committee meet or speak with the shortlisted candidates and agree upon a recommendation which is put to the board for review, taking account of matters such as the candidate's existing appointments and associated time commitments as well as any actual or potential conflicts of interest.\n\n## Diversity: board\n\nIn line with the transparency and accountability arms of the global framework, in July 2021 further to a recommendation by the people and governance committee, the board approved a DE&I policy which complements bp's wider diversity policies and which embraces the group's values, code of conduct and sustainability frame. The full DE&I policy is available on online at bp.com/corporategovernance.\n\nUnder the DE&I policy, the board commits to:\n\n- \u00b7 Encourage a diverse and inclusive working environment in the boardroom, where everyone is accepted, valued and receives fair treatment according to their different needs and situations without discrimination or prejudice.\n\n- \u00b7 Continue our journey towards greater diversity on the board across all dimensions, aspiring to achieve gender parity and greater representation of those with an ethnic minority background over time.\n- \u00b7 Consider all aspects of diversity when reviewing the board's composition, its skills, experience and overall balance, including when conducting the annual board effectiveness review.\n- \u00b7 Oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession to the board and monitor that all board appointments are subject to a formal, rigorous, and transparent procedure and that such appointments are based on merit and objective criteria taking into account (among other things) factors such as diversity of gender, age, educational and professional background, social, ethnic and geographical background and cognitive and personal strengths. Engage search firms who understand bp's values and approach to diversity, equity and inclusion and agree to comply with those values and approach in identifying suitable board candidates from diverse candidate pools.\n\nGiven changes to the composition of the board during 2021, bp currently has a board that is smaller than in previous years. Although work to add new and suitably qualified skills and experience to refresh its composition continues, at the end of 2021 the board had 10 members.\n\n## Skills matrix\n\n|                         | Background and experience a   | Background and experience a                   | Background and experience a                 | Background and experience a          | Background and experience a         | Background and experience a                           | Background and experience a        | Background and experience a   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                         | Energy   markets              | Operational  excellence  and risk  management | Global business  leadership and  governance | Technology,  digital and  innovation | Climate  change and  sustainability | People leadership  and organizational  transformation | Society, politics  and geopolitics | Finance, risk  and trading    |\n| Non-executive directors |                               |                                               |                                             |                                      |                                     |                                                       |                                    |                               |\n| Helge Lund              |                               |                                               |                                             |                                      |                                     |                                                       |                                    |                               |\n| Paula Rosput Reynolds   |                               |                                               |                                             |                                      |                                     |                                                       |                                    |                               |\n| Tushar Morzaria         |                               |                                               |                                             |                                      |                                     |                                                       |                                    |                               |\n| Melody Meyer            |                               |                                               |                                             |                                      |                                     |                                                       |                                    |                               |\n| Sir John Sawers         |                               |                                               |                                             |                                      |                                     |                                                       |                                    |                               |\n| Karen Richardson        |                               |                                               |                                             |                                      |                                     |                                                       |                                    |                               |\n| Pamela Daley            |                               |                                               |                                             |                                      |                                     |                                                       |                                    |                               |\n| Johannes Teyssen        |                               |                                               |                                             |                                      |                                     |                                                       |                                    |                               |\n\n- a The skills set out here are defined based on bp's internal assessment.",

        "page_content": "## People and governance committee continued\n\nThrough these 10 members, a range of personal strengths, industry expertise and nationalities is represented and further details on the skills and backgrounds of individual board members is set out in the board biography section on pages 84-87. From a gender perspective, the board is comprised of four female directors and six male directors, representing 40% female representation (2020 45%, 2019 42%). Two of the four main board committees are chaired by a female director, one of whom holds the position of senior independent director.\n\nWhile the board aspires to achieve gender parity, progress against diversity targets is sensitive to the size of the board. In respect of other forms of diversity, one member of the board self-identifies as being from a non-white ethnic minority background. In accordance with the board's policy, the board as a whole aspires to have greater representation of those from an ethnic minority over time.\n\n## Diversity: senior leaders\n\nOur senior management, as defined in the Corporate Governance Code 2018 and their direct reports comprise 49% women (2020 43%) and 26% Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME individuals (2020 25%).\n\nIn reviewing the succession pipeline, the committee recognizes the challenges faced by women and those from minority groups, and particularly the additional issues they face in progressing to senior roles. The committee supports the work undertaken by management to support career progression of under-represented groups in a sector that has historically been male-dominated with limited diversity in other forms. Specifically, this includes the ambition to have females in 50% of the top 120 leader roles by 2025, our US minority ambition to have 20% of our group and senior leader roles held by minorities by 2025 and our UK ethnicity ambition to achieve 15% of our senior leader roles to be held by minorities.\n\n## Diversity: employees\n\nThe committee recognizes that improving the diversity of senior leaders cannot be achieved without promoting diversity throughout the whole workforce. Diversity, equity and inclusion considerations remain key to the group's people strategy with a commitment to ensure that talented individuals are able to access fulfilling careers across all of bp's areas of operations regardless of their background.\n\nThe board, as a whole, is supportive of the group's employee-led business resource groups (BRGs) which centre around specific themes including, among others, ethnicity, sexual orientation, working parents and people with disabilities. BRGs provide support and networking opportunities for their members and are open for all employees to join in order to support the group's diversity and inclusion initiatives. The board is also supportive of awareness training sessions and 'huddles' including those hosted this year on neurodiversity and mental wellbeing.\n\nDuring 2021, the chair of the committee held a feedback session with members of two BRGs focused on ethnic minority groups, the USAAN (US-based 'African American Network') and the PEN (UK-based 'Positively Ethnic Network'). This session formed part of the broader workforce engagement programme (details of which are set out on page 95) and brought together ethnic minority colleagues from across bp's operations and with a range of tenure from over 20 years' service to those who had recently joined through the graduate programme. A broad range of topics were discussed including how opportunities for ethnic minorities had improved over recent years. The feedback from this session was received by the people and governance committee and later reported to the whole board to deepen directors' insights into employees' views and experiences.\n\n## Succession\n\nKaren Richardson and Johannes Teyssen joined the board on 1 January 2021. Dame Alison Carnwath stepped down from the board on 14 January 2021 and Brendan Nelson and Dame Ann Dowling stepped down on 12 May 2021 following the AGM. The new board members bring extensive financial, technological, transformation and energy industry experience to the board and will ensure that a strong focus on strategic execution, safety and sustainability and connectivity to bp's core businesses and markets continues.\n\nUnder its terms of reference, the committee has responsibility for identifying and articulating the objectives and criteria of any board appointment process. This is based upon requirements identified from a review of the experience, skills and diversity of background of the board and its committees. For executive directors, the committee gives consideration to existing succession plans. The committee is responsible for engaging an independent executive search consultant, who assists in preparing shortlists of candidates, co-ordinating interviews and seeking references. In accordance with the DE&I policy, the committee engages with external search firms who are able to align with bp's approach to diversity, equity and inclusion in identifying suitable individuals from diverse pools of candidates. It is expected that all members of the committee meet or speak with the shortlisted candidates and agree upon a recommendation which is put to the board for review, taking account of matters such as the candidate's existing appointments and associated time commitments as well as any actual or potential conflicts of interest.",

All members attended each meeting with the exception of Karen Richardson who was unable to attend one of the meetings. Regular attendees include the chief financial officer, SVP accounting reporting control, SVP internal audit, EVP legal and the external auditor.\n\n## Membership\n\nTushar Morzaria\n\nMember since September 2020 and chair since May 2021\n\nPamela Daley\n\nMember\n\nPaula Reynolds\n\nMember\n\nKaren Richardson\n\nMember since May 2021\n\nBrendan Nelson\n\nMember and chair - resigned from the board May 2021\n\nAlison Carnwath\n\nMember - resigned from the board January 2021\n\nTushar Morzaria is chair of the audit committee. See page 86 for his biography. The board is satisfied that he is the audit committee member with recent and relevant financial experience as provided for by the UK Corporate Governance Code and that he is competent in accounting and auditing in accordance with the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules. It considers that the committee as a whole has an appropriate and experienced blend of commercial, financial and audit expertise to assess the issues it is required to address, as well as competence in the oil and gas sector. The board has also determined that, as bp is a foreign private issuer, the audit committee meets the independence criteria provisions of Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that Mr Morzaria can be regarded as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F.\n\n## Chair's introduction\n\nI am pleased to introduce my first report as audit committee chair. The committee has continued to assist the board in fulfilling its responsibilities, by monitoring the integrity of the group's financial reporting and risk management systems and challenging management and the external auditor across a number of areas, including key accounting judgements and control matters.\n\nKaren Richardson joined the committee following the AGM in May 2021. She brings broad financial and commercial experience to the committee. Brendan Nelson stepped down from the committee and the board at the AGM. I would like to thank him for his diligent leadership, constructive challenge and contribution to the committee over the last 11 years. Prior to standing down, a thorough handover was completed and I held meetings with the committee's key stakeholders which, among other things, sought to identify possible areas for improvement. The outcome of these meetings was overwhelmingly positive, with stakeholders noting that the committee was working well. Some small improvements were implemented, including the quality of materials presented to the committee and placing additional emphasis on risk and control matters.\n\nThe committee spent considerable time reviewing trading activities, including how this 'integrator' supports bp's strategy and execution. The committee also considered energy price volatility and how this risk was managed by the business, particularly in the US in February and in Europe and Asia in the latter half of the year.\n\nFollowing the board's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft, the committee has undertaken a preliminary review with the external auditor of the accounting implications arising from that decision. This included consideration of the implications for the going concern assumption, longer-term viability and resilience statements in the context of the current economic and geopolitical environment and to ensure the consistency of the disclosures in the annual report with this decision.\n\nIn 2022, the committee will monitor the progress in the UK of audit and corporate governance reform proposals by the UK government as well as the work being undertaken by the new International Sustainability Standards Board announced at COP26.\n\n## Tushar Morzaria\n\nCommittee chair",

        "page_content": "## Activities during the year\n\n## How the committee reviewed financial disclosure\n\nThe committee reviewed the quarterly, half-year and annual financial statements with management, focusing on the:\n\n- \u00b7 Integrity of the group's financial reporting process.\n- \u00b7 Clarity of disclosure.\n- \u00b7 Compliance with relevant legal and financial reporting standards.\n- \u00b7 Application of accounting policies and judgements.\n\nAs part of its review, the committee received regular updates from management and the external auditor in relation to accounting judgements and estimates, including those relating to recoverability of asset carrying values and the impact of climate risk and opportunities.\n\nIn considering the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 , the committee assessed whether the report was fair, balanced and understandable and also whether it provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position and performance, business model and strategy. In making this assessment, the committee examined disclosures during the year, discussed the requirements with senior management, confirmed that representations to the external auditor had been evidenced and reviewed reports relating to internal control over financial reporting. The committee reviewed the consistency of the narrative disclosures and financial statements with climate risks and opportunities. It received a report from management on the verification\n\nprocess undertaken in respect of the annual report, including TCFD disclosures. The committee made a recommendation to the board, which in turn reviewed the report as a whole, confirmed the assessment and approved the report's publication.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 110 for how the committee considered climate risks and opportunities in reviewing financial disclosure.\n\n## How accounting judgements and estimates were considered and addressed\n\nThe committee was briefed on a quarterly basis in 2021 on the group's key accounting judgements and estimates during the preparation of these financial statements, which were discussed with management and the external auditor.\n\nThe key accounting judgements and estimates are set out on pages 178-196. The committee also considered and addressed key accounting estimates and judgements relating to exploration and appraisal intangibles and pensions and other post-retirement benefits. See Financial statements - Note 1 for further information.\n\nThe committee is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately address the key accounting judgements and estimates in respect of both the amounts reported and disclosures made and in particular that they reflect the impact of the group's transition strategy.\n\n## How risks were reviewed\n\nThe principal risks allocated to the audit committee for monitoring in 2021 included those associated with:\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable (FBU) reporting\n\n## Regular audit committee review\n\nThe committee received updates on key sections of the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 early in the drafting process to provide sufficient time for comment and review.\n\n## Report on the financial control environment\n\nThe committee received updates on the control environment and integrity of the financial reporting process.\n\n## Verification and management assurance\n\nThe committee reviewed the assurance process in place for non-financial reporting (incorporating TCFD disclosures) and received\n\nreports from internal audit and risk on the system of internal controls and risk management.\n\n## External auditor report\n\nThe committee received a report from the external auditor on the outcome of its audit work, highlighting the key audit matters set out in the independent auditor's report on pages 146-165.\n\n## Recommendation to the board\n\nThe committee made a recommendation to the board, which in turn reviewed the report as a whole and confirmed the assessment. The directors' statement can be found on page 142.\n\nTrading and shipping activities: including risks arising from shortcomings or failures in systems, risk management methodology, internal control processes or employees.\n\nIn reviewing this risk, the committee focused on external market developments and how bp's trading and shipping integrator had continued to enhance its control environment and policies to strengthen its compliance and control culture. This was particularly important in relation to the price volatility seen during 2021.\n\nThe committee further considered updates in trading and shipping's risk management programme, including compliance with regulatory developments, activities in response to cyber threats and efficiencies derived from more collaborative ways of working across bp and the use of digital technologies.\n\nThe committee also reviewed the continued impact of COVID-19 on operations and the control environment associated with trading activities, with particular reference to operational considerations associated with increased remote working.\n\nCompliance with business and regulations: including ethical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws or regulations that could damage bp's reputation, adversely affect operational results and/or shareholder value and potentially affect bp's licence to operate.\n\nThe committee reviewed the group's programme of controls and contingencies for managing this risk, including enhanced approaches to monitor the risk in light of business evolution (such as an increase in venturing), as well as other internal and external trends.\n\nDigital and cyber security risk: including user access controls, misuse of information and systems and disruption of business activity.\n\nThe committee reviewed ongoing developments in bp's digital environment, incorporating aspects of cyber security related to user access controls, the optimization of core services and the modernization of bp.\n\nFinancial liquidity: including the risk associated with external market conditions, supply and demand and prices achieved for bp's products which could impact financial performance.\n\nThe committee reviewed the key assumptions and underlying judgements used to manage the group's liquidity and capital investments (including appraisal, effectiveness and efficiency) and considered the impact of price volatility on available liquidity.",

The SVP internal audit attends the meetings of the committee.\n\n## Site visit during the year\n\nIn October 2021, the committee conducted a visit to the trading & shipping integrator in London, UK, including presentations from the trading floor covering low carbon trading, European power and global biofuels.\n\nKey areas of discussion during this site visit included the impacts of oil and gas price volatility, business development of global power trading and opportunities and risks associated with the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nInternal audit has a five-year strategy setting out the goals and vision for the function and an update on progress was provided to the committee during the year. The committee also reviewed and approved the internal audit charter, which sets out the expectations for the function in accordance with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors' (IIA) guidelines.\n\nThe committee received quarterly reports on the findings of internal audit in 2021, setting out progress against the internal audit plan for the year, adaptations made to the plan as the year progressed and key audit findings, together with management's response.\n\nThe committee continued to monitor and review the effectiveness and capabilities of internal audit during the year. In assessing its effectiveness, the committee followed the guidance included in the Financial Reporting Council Guidance on Audit Committees which, in addition to approving the annual plan and reviewing reports on the same as mentioned above, included meeting privately with the SVP internal audit, and receiving feedback from other key stakeholders on the effectiveness of the function.\n\nThe committee concluded that internal audit had unrestricted scope, together with access to information and sufficient resources to fulfil its mandate.\n\nSeparately, the committee reviewed the independence and objectivity of the SVP internal audit, who has now served for seven years, in line with IIA best practice guidelines. The committee concluded that the SVP internal audit remained independent and objective. In reaching this conclusion, the committee considered feedback from key stakeholders, access to information\n\nAbove: Tushar and Pamela speaking to colleagues on the trading floor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand the resources available and the response of management to the challenge received.\n\nThe committee also received a report from internal audit on its annual review of the system of internal control and risk management, together with an assessment from management on the system of internal control. Further information can be found in the risk management and internal control update on pages 142-143.\n\n## Non-financial reporting assurance framework\n\nIn the second half of the year, the committee discussed the control and assurance framework for non-financial reporting (NFR) included in the annual report and other documents published by bp under a broad range of regulatory and voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, including TCFD. As these frameworks and standards evolve and investors and other stakeholders increasingly come to rely on these data points it is important that a suitable control and assurance framework is put in place. Management presented proposals for the development of the NFR assurance framework.\n\nThe committee considered the role of the second and third lines of defence, including how the internal audit plan would capture material metrics, and the role of external assurance. Those metrics relevant to TCFD 'comply or explain' disclosures were considered material. Internal audit completed an audit of certain metrics and TCFD disclosures and reported the outcome of its work to the committee.\n\nThe committee will monitor the implementation of the NFR assurance framework as part of its role in overseeing the system of internal control.\n\n## Training and briefings\n\nThe committee considered market updates and developments throughout the year. This included technical accounting updates from the SVP accounting reporting control on developments in financial reporting and accounting policy, as well as on accounting and disclosure changes that would be introduced as a result of the reorganization of the group. The committee also received briefings on specific topics, including risk governance and the audit and corporate governance consultation undertaken by the UK government during 2021.\n\nThe committee, together with the board, received an update on the non-financial disclosures included in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 and the assurance process underlying the same shortly after the year end.",

        "page_content": "## How the committee considered climate risks and opportunities\n\nThe committee's primary role in monitoring the effectiveness of bp's financial reporting, systems of internal control and risk management means that it is well placed to consider the risks and opportunities associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. There are several ways in which the committee has considered climate risk and opportunities during the year, which are set out below.\n\nIn March 2021, the committee reviewed the Lightsource bp business and received an update on strategy, performance, capability and risk management as well as on its first, second and third lines of defence policies. The committee discussed the capital structures and process for investment decisions.\n\nIn July 2021, the committee conducted its annual review of energy price assumptions, covering the period 2022-50. The scope included oil, natural gas, refining margins and carbon prices within a broad range of scenarios. The committee reviewed and challenged the underlying assumptions provided by management, the changes from the prior year and their consistency with the goals of the Paris agreement compared to a broad spectrum of external Paris-consistent scenarios.\n\nThe energy price assumptions are used in investment appraisal assumptions and for determining impairments. The committee assessed the differing treatment of carbon emission costs under each judgement and management's best estimate of how future changes were likely to affect the future cash flows of the group. The committee\n\n## FRC thematic review\n\nThe bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 was included in the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) sample for its thematic review on the disclosure of alternative performance measures (APMs). The committee noted the findings from the thematic review, where bp's disclosures were considered to be examples of better practice and how further improvements could be incorporated into bp's 2021 Annual Report .\n\nAn FRC review provides no assurance that bp's 2020 Annual Report was correct in all material respects. The FRC's role was not to verify the information provided, but to consider compliance with reporting requirements. Its letters are written on the basis that the FRC (which includes the FRC's officers, employees\n\nreviewed impairments and reversals during the year as part of its review of quarterly financial disclosures and, in February 2022, the committee reviewed the full year.\n\nThe committee reviewed the process for estimating decommissioning liabilities for our operations, in particular for oil and gas property, plant and equipment, and challenged the assumptions used in determining the same, including the anticipated time period over which decommissioning liabilities were expected to be incurred in respect of the pace of transition to a low carbon economy and the alignment to bp's aims and ambitions to 2030, particularly with respect to refineries. The committee also assessed the process for monitoring decommissioning reversion risk.\n\nThe committee considered the impact of energy prices, consistent with those noted above for investment appraisal and impairment, as part of its assessment of going concern and the longer-term viability statement.\n\nIn the latter half of the year, the committee reviewed bp ventures and Launchpad and received an update on how the investment portfolio was integrated into bp's strategy. Shortly after the year-end the committee reviewed management's scenario analysis and the inputs used to determine the resilience of our strategy to different climate scenarios.\n\nFurther details on the key accounting judgements can be found on pages 178-196. For more information on the resilience of our strategy see the Sustainability section on pages 61 to 64.\n\nand agents) accepts no liability for reliance on them by bp or any third party, including but not limited to investors and shareholders.\n\n## External audit\n\nHow the committee assessed audit risk The external auditor set out its audit plan for 2021, identifying significant audit risks to be addressed during the course of the audit.\n\n## These included:\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment and reversal of oil and gas property, plant and equipment values.\n- \u00b7 Accounting for structured commodity transactions.\n- \u00b7 Valuation of level 3 instruments in trading and shipping.\n- \u00b7 Management override of controls.\n\nA summary of the audit approach is set out in the independent auditor's report on page 147.\n\nThe committee received updates during the year on the audit process, including how the auditor had challenged the group's assumptions on the significant audit risks.\n\nHow the committee assessed audit fees The audit committee reviews the fee structure, resourcing and terms of engagement for the external auditor annually; in addition it reviews the non-audit services that the auditor provides to the group on a quarterly basis.\n\nFees paid to the external auditor for the year were $58 million (2020 $54 million), of which nil% was for non-audit and other assurance services (see Financial statements - Note 35). The audit committee is satisfied that this level of fee is appropriate in respect of the audit services provided and that an effective audit can be conducted for this fee. There were no non-audit or non-audit related assurance fees for the year (2020 $1 million). Non-audit or non-audit related services consisted of other assurance services.\n\nHow the committee assessed audit effectiveness\n\nAs part of its overall assessment of audit effectiveness, the committee considers reports from the external auditor and management (see below) on the audit process and quality procedures, together with responses to questions on the same, and the handling of key judgements. The committee also held private meetings with the external auditor during the year and the committee chair met separately with the external auditor and SVP internal audit at least quarterly.\n\nThe committee assessed the auditor's approach to providing audit services, taking account of the insights report and management survey, together with the reporting to the committee. The committee concluded that the audit team was providing the required quality in relation to the provision of the services. The audit team had shown the necessary commitment and ability to provide the services together with a demonstrable depth of knowledge, robustness, independence and objectivity as well as an appreciation of complex issues. The team had posed constructive challenge to management and the committee noted the quality of reporting provided to it.",

        "page_content": "## Audit quality reports received by the committee\n\nExternal auditor insights report: the committee receives a summary of areas of opportunity for improvements to processes related to financial reporting or internal control identified as part of the audit process, management's response to the recommendations identified and progress made against any prior year items together with areas of focus for the forthcoming year.\n\nManagement survey: the survey sought views from key internal stakeholders and comprised questions across the following:\n\n- (i) The external auditor's performance, for which the main measurement criteria were:\n- -Planning and scope\n- -Robustness of the audit process\n- -Independence and objectivity\n- -Quality of delivery\n- -Quality of people and service.\n- (ii)  bp's commitment to the audit.\n\nThe overall score from the survey remained flat against the prior year, following an increase in 2020 versus 2019. However, strong improvements were seen across communication, international co-operation and knowledge of controls and risks.\n\nHow the auditor reappointment and independence were assessed\n\nThe committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor each year before making a recommendation to the board. The committee assesses the independence of the external auditor on an ongoing basis, taking account of the information and assurances provided by the external auditor and the level of nonaudit fees. The external auditor is required to rotate the lead audit partner every five years and other senior audit staff every five to seven years. No partners or senior staff associated with the bp audit may transfer to the group.\n\nExternal audit services were last tendered in 2016 and the external auditor has been in role for four years (since 2018). It is anticipated that a retender will be completed by 2026 or sooner, in line with relevant guidelines. The committee believes that the anticipated timeline for the retender of audit services is in the best interests of shareholders. It provides an appropriate balance of factors such as the auditor knowledge of controls and risks, maintaining audit quality, independence and objectivity, and providing value for money.\n\nThe company is in compliance with the requirements of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.\n\nHow the committee had oversight of non-audit services\n\nThe audit committee is responsible for bp's policy on non-audit services and the approval of non-audit services. Audit objectivity and independence are safeguarded through the prohibition of non-audit tax services being provided by the external auditor and the limitation of audit-related work which falls within defined categories. bp's policy on non-audit services states that the auditor may not perform non-audit services that are prohibited by the SEC, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) or the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n\nThe audit committee approves the terms of all audit services as well as permitted auditrelated and non-audit services in advance. The external auditor is considered for permitted non-audit services only when its expertise and experience of bp is important.\n\nApprovals for individual engagements of preapproved permitted services below certain thresholds are delegated to the SVP accounting reporting control or the chief financial officer. Any proposed service not included in the permitted services categories must be approved in advance either by the audit committee chair or the audit committee before engagement commences.\n\nThe audit committee, chief financial officer and SVP accounting reporting control monitor overall compliance with bp's policy on audit-related and non-audit services, including whether the necessary pre-approvals have been obtained.\n\nThe categories of permitted and pre-approved services are outlined in principal accountant's fees and services on page 362.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe committee reviewed the affordability of the distribution policy elements of the financial frame (covering dividend increases and share buybacks) as part of its review of the quarterly results. The committee considered bp's cash flow forecasts as it transitions to an international energy company and the risks associated with oil and gas price changes over the medium term.\n\nThe committee reviewed, and recommended to the board, updates to the risk framework and changes to the highest priority group risks. The committee reviewed its Terms of reference and minor updates were agreed, including making clear how the committee considers climate risks and opportunities. Further details can be found in the corporate governance framework on page 92.\n\nAn assessment of going concern was made as part of the quarterly results process. The committee also reviewed the longer-term viability statement. The going concern and longer term viability statements can be found on page 143.",

Most of these decommissioning events are many years in the future and the exact requirements that will have to be met when a removal event occurs are uncertain. Assumptions are made by bp in relation to settlement dates, technology, legal requirements and discount rates. The timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty and estimation is required in determining the amounts of provisions to be recognized. There is also a risk that decommissioning obligations from previously divested assets revert to bp.\n\n## Recoverability of asset carrying values\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset, cash generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management judgement and estimates on uncertain matters such as future commodity prices, discount rates, production profiles, reserves and the impact of inflation on operating expenses.\n\nReserves estimates based on management's assumptions for future commodity prices have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the financial statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Received briefings on decommissioning (including the process for managing the risk of decommissioning reversion), environmental, asbestos and litigation provisions.

The committee is satisfied with  management's assessment that the  group can continue to operate as a  going concern for at least 12 months  from the date of approval of the  financial statements. |\n\n## Investment in Rosneft and Aker BP\n\nJudgement is required in assessing the level of control or influence over another entity in which the group holds an interest. bp uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in Rosneft and Aker BP and bp's share of Rosneft's and Aker BP's oil and natural gas reserves are included in the group's estimated net proved reserves of equity-accounted entities.\n\nThe equity-accounting treatment of bp's 19.75% interest in Rosneft in 2021 was dependent on the judgement that bp had significant influence over Rosneft. bp announced on 27 February 2022 that it will exit its shareholding in Rosneft.\n\nbp's interest in Aker BP is expected to fall to 15.9% following Aker BP's proposed transaction with Lundin Energy however bp expects it will continue to have significant influence over Aker BP.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nFor its level 3 derivative financial instruments, bp estimates their fair values using internal models due to the absence of quoted market pricing or other observable, market-corroborated data. Judgement may be required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell commodities meet the definition of a derivative, in particular LNG contracts.\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the judgement on whether the group had significant influence over Rosneft during 2021 and expects to continue to have significant influence over Aker BP following completion of the Lundin Energy transaction.\n- \u00b7 Considered IFRS guidance on evidence of participation in policymaking processes.\n- \u00b7 Received reports from management which assessed the extent of significant influence, including bp's participation in decision-making.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the accounting implications of bp's announcement to exit its shareholding in Rosneft.\n- \u00b7 Received regular reports on derivative accounting judgements.\n- \u00b7 Received a briefing on the group's trading risks and reviewed the system of risk management and controls in place.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the control process and risks relating to the trading business.\n- \u00b7 bp retained significant influence over Rosneft throughout 2021 as defined by IFRS.\n- \u00b7 As a result of bp's two nominated directors stepping down from the Rosneft board on 27 February 2022, bp has determined that it no longer has significant influence over Rosneft from that date. See Notes 1 and 37 for further information.\n- \u00b7 The committee supported the judgement that bp will retain significant influence over Aker BP following the proposed Lundin Energy transaction and therefore has not classified the whole investment as an asset held for sale. See Note 1 and 2 for further information.\n- \u00b7 bp considers that contracts to buy or sell LNG do not meet the definition of a derivative under IFRS.\n- \u00b7 bp has assets and liabilities of $5.7 and $7.6 billion, respectively, recognized on the balance sheet for level 3 derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2021 mainly relating to the activities of the trading and shipping function.\n- \u00b7 bp's use of internal models to value certain of these contracts has been disclosed in Note 1.",

This role extends to the leadership team's management of personal and process safety risks, security and cyber security risks, operational, environmental and social risks, ethics and compliance risks and modern slavery risk management. It also includes monitoring the effectiveness of the implementation of bp's sustainability frame, including the implementation of bp's net zero ambition and associated aims and targets. To support with this oversight, the S&SC receives assurance that processes to identify and mitigate such non-financial risks are appropriate in their design and effective in their implementation.\n\n## Key responsibilities of the S&SC\n\nThe S&SC terms of reference are available on bp's website, its responsibilities include:\n\n- 1. Monitoring and or testing:\n- \u00b7 bp's performance in respect of safety and sustainability matters; and\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of bp's system of internal control for the safety and sustainability matters, including applicable management systems, policies, practices, processes, leadership and culture; informed by the receipt of performance and assurance reports.\n- 2. Monitoring the management and mitigation of the principal risks allocated to the S&SC by the board and such emerging risks as the S&SC may determine fall within its scope from time to time.\n- 3. Reviewing and testing management's responses to relevant quarterly reports of group internal audit and the findings of selected safety investigations.\n- 4. Reviewing bp's modern slavery risk management, annual sustainability report and such other materials intended for disclosure or publication as may be allocated to it by the board from time to time.\n- 5. Conducting such other oversight activities as may be allocated to it by the board from time to time. However, the S&SC is entitled to investigate all matters falling within its scope.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe committee monitored and promoted safe, secure, and reliable operations during the continued impacts of the global pandemic in 2021, and had an expanded focus on embedding bp's sustainability frame.\n\n## Meetings and attendance\n\nThere were six S&SC meetings in 2021. Four of these meetings were attended by the CEO and by the chair of the board. The SVP safety and operational risk (S&OR) attended every meeting. The SVP internal audit and/or his delegate and the EVP legal also attended meetings, as required. At the conclusion of each meeting the S&SC holds private sessions purely for its members, without management in attendance, to discuss any issues arising and the quality of the meeting. The CEO receives invitations to join the private meetings on an ad hoc basis. At least once a year the SVP internal audit is invited to a private meeting with the S&SC. The S&SC chair reports to the board after each meeting to ensure that the key matters arising at each S&SC meeting are brought to its attention.\n\n## S&SC members and appointment dates\n\nMelody Meyer\n\nMember since May 2017 and chair since November 2019\n\nProfessor Dame Ann Dowling\n\nMember (resigned 12 May 2021)\n\nSir John Sawers Johannes Teyssen\n\nMember\n\n(appointed 1 January 2021)\n\n## Chair's introduction\n\nDuring 2021, the S&SC continued to monitor the work of the leadership team to drive continued improvement in overall safety and environmental performance, with a specific focus on reducing tier 1 process safety incidents. The committee monitored processes and performance in mitigating personal security and cyber security risks. Overall, I am pleased to report that bp maintained solid safety, environmental, and security performance while managing the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEarly in 2021, the S&SC agreed a plan for monitoring the effectiveness and implementation of bp's sustainability frame, which includes embedding many sustainability processes and aims into the operating management system (OMS) as it is a proven process for safety and environmental performance improvement. In July, the S&SC received feedback on the executive outreach programme for the sustainability aims; collecting feedback from academics, corporate partners, government representatives, NGOs and investors. Overall this feedback was positive and the inputs were considered as the sustainability frame evolved.\n\nFrom September, the S&SC assumed primary oversight responsibility for the quarterly review of ethics and compliance matters; with the full board continuing to receive ethics and compliance updates annually as part of its oversight responsibility of bp's ethics and compliance programme. In December, after a full board evaluation of the risk framework, the S&SC high priority group risks were modified to ensure S&SC oversight of the board principal risks that are assigned to the committee. The S&SC terms of reference were updated and the role of the S&SC clarified with respect to the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. For more information, see the corporate governance framework on page 92.\n\nDuring the year the S&SC also held additional focused reviews on process safety improvements, cyber security drills, modern slavery, and took part in deeper dives with the full board on aim 3 and TCFD.\n\nIn 2022, while continuing to monitor the risks and performance in safety, security and sustainability, the committee will focus on the continued goal to eliminate tier 1 process safety incidents by 2025 and the implementation of bp's net zero ambition and associated aims and targets. The S&SC will monitor bp's work to provide input to the newlyformed International Sustainability Standards Board, which plans to establish a global baseline for sustainability-related disclosure standards that can inform decision-making on sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities. We also look forward to additional site visits in person in 2022.\n\n## Melody Meyer",

        "page_content": "## S&SC's year in review\n\nThe S&SC and audit committee worked together, through their chairs and secretaries, to ensure that agendas did not overlap or omit coverage of any key risks during the year. The S&SC is entitled to ask for any independent advice and counsel on an unrestricted basis.\n\n## Safety, system of internal control and risk management\n\nThe S&SC received specific reports from the business segments and functions, which include, but are not limited to, the safety and operational risk function, shipping, internal audit and group security.\n\nThe review of operational risk and performance forms a large part of the S&SC's agenda. Internal audit provided quarterly reports on its assurance work and its annual review of the system of internal control and risk management.\n\nThe S&SC also received regular reports from the CEO and SVP S&OR on operational risk, including regular reports prepared on the group's health, safety, security and environmental performance and operational integrity. These included meeting-by-meeting measures of personal and process safety, environmental and regulatory compliance, security and cyber risk, as well as quarterly reports from internal audit on its activity.\n\n## Virtual site visit\n\nIn April 2021 the S&SC members made a virtual site visit to Angola, one of bp's key centres for hydrocarbon exploration. Discussions during this visit covered a broad range of topics including the steps being undertaken to address tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events,\n\nintegrity and hazard recognition, the impact of COVID-19, the methane measurement project and social impact investment. The virtual site visit was also an opportunity for effective virtual engagement with the local staff in Angola.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the SVP, internal audit regularly met in private with the chair and other members of the S&SC over the course of the year.\n\nDuring the year the S&SC received separate reports on bp's management of risks relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 Marine\n- \u00b7 Wells\n- \u00b7 Pipelines\n- \u00b7 Explosion or release at our facilities\n- \u00b7 Major security incidents\n- \u00b7 Cyber security (process control networks)\n- \u00b7 Ethics and compliance\n\nThe S&SC reviewed these risks and their management and mitigation in depth with relevant executive management. Additionally, the S&SC reviewed and approved the 2022 audit plan for the internal audit function.\n\nThe S&SC also has responsibility for reviewing bp's modern slavery risk management progress and has responsibility for considering focus areas for bp's future plans.\n\n## Corporate reporting\n\nThe S&SC reviewed the bp sustainability report 2020. They also received an update from the external auditor with respect to their limited assurance of selected sustainability key performance indicators and reviewed the scope of 2021-related sustainability assurance.\n\n## Embedding the sustainability frame\n\nIn 1Q 2021, the S&SC reviewed the sustainability frame, with sessions on getting to net zero, improving people's lives and caring for the planet. In September, the S&SC reviewed progress against aims 1 and 4 on net zero operations and reducing methane. This included plans for emissions management across flaring, operating efficiencies, such as spinning reserve monitoring, and methane measurement. Progress and forward plans on aim 16 enhancing biodiversity was also reviewed. In December, the S&SC endorsed sustainable emissions reduction targets for 2022 and reviewed sustainability implementation progress and plans for 2022.

As reflected elsewhere in this annual report, 2021 was another challenging year. The pandemic lingered. Yet, bp people completed the most significant restructuring in the company's history, safely delivering strong operational results and a return to profitability. For all of this and their commitment to progressing the energy transition, we owe our thanks.\n\n## Overview of bp performance, and the remuneration outcomes arising for 2021\n\nEvery year, we seek to reward performance throughout the organization via an annual bonus plan. The 2021 bonus scorecard consists of three categories of measures, safety and sustainability, operational, and financial. The company met its safety targets which were in line with the preceding year. Emissions reductions were well in excess of target, reflecting a cumulative reduction of almost 5.6 million tonnes since 2017 when we first set goals for emissions reductions. While outcomes for availability and reliability for bp's hydrocarbon plants and refining operations were below target, the effects of the pandemic continued to make operations challenging in 2021. By contrast, our margin share from convenience and electrification exceeded target as our retail network continued to grow. Financial performance, as measured by free cash flow and cumulative cash cost reductions, was outstanding. Taking all of these measures into account, the formulaic outcome was 1.61 out of 2.0. Given the more than satisfactory achievements overall, the committee did not apply any discretion and the plan should pay out, unadjusted, at 80.5% of maximum. For our employees, this result will be a welcome outcome as last year the vast majority of our workforce received no bonus.",

        "page_content": "We also reward executives through the vesting of performance share awards. The 2019-21 awards were the last shares granted under the 2017 remuneration policy, and consist of three measures: relative total shareholder return (rTSR) weighted at 50%; return on average capital employed (ROACE) weighted at 20%; and strategic progress imperatives weighted at 30%. On a formulaic basis, neither the rTSR nor ROACE measures met threshold for vesting. Only the strategic progress measure was met, through a blend of quantitative assessments and qualitative judgements which are described later in this report on pages 123 and 124. The committee considered the outcome in the round, taking into account the external environment. Whilst there will be no vesting in respect of the financial measures, the committee recognizes the strong strategic progress made over the period and concluded that the formulaic outcome of 30% of the maximum was appropriate and there would be no application of discretion.\n\n## Forward-looking committee decisions\n\nWhen making pay decisions for the wider workforce for 2022, the leadership team has been especially sensitive to the wage trends being experienced across the globe. The committee realizes that these are inflationary times and endorsed a somewhat larger budget for pay increases for the wider workforce this year, confirming our long-held aim to align jobs with market rates. Within the UK, bp has matched increases in the real living wage which exceeds the national minimums, and remains a real living wage employer.\n\nBernard continues to lead the enterprise with a bold vision and has also demonstrated that his goal of 'performing while transforming' is being met. Given his continued strong performance for the company, we propose to adjust Bernard's salary by 4.25% in 2022, in line with the budget for the majority of the wider workforce in the UK.\n\nMurray has also continued to grow and fully meet the challenges of the CFO role. He now leads as a seasoned CFO. You will recall that we set his pay upon appointment at a level significantly below that of his predecessor. We increased his salary in 2021 by a rate higher than that of the budget for the majority of the wider workforce in the UK, based on his performance and market comparables. We described our thinking in last year's report, and signalled that the 2021 increase was likely to be the first of two adjustments to move Murray's base salary to be more in line with that of his predecessor. We therefore propose to increase Murray's salary by 6.6% to \u00a3800,000 which, in our view, appropriately reflects his many contributions. This also aligns him competitively with CFOs across the FTSE 30 and with roles of similar complexity.\n\nOur 2020 remuneration policy established flexibility to adjust performance measures and weightings in our bonus and performance share plans so we can respond to circumstances and tailor incentives. While we have deliberated on our performance measures during our recent meetings, we have determined that the measures and weightings used in our most recent scorecards (2021 bonus and 2021-23 performance shares) continue to align remuneration outcomes with the strategic imperatives. Therefore, we will not make adjustments to measures for the 2022 bonus or the 2022-24 performance share plan. Keeping goals constant should assist in evaluating our progress over the next several years.\n\n## Shareholder and stakeholder engagement\n\nIn reaching the remuneration decisions described above, we have appreciated the input which we solicited and received from our largest shareholders and from selected shareholder representative bodies in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nOver the last year we have also reflected on the counsel we have received from shareholders, with a particular focus on the need to improve transparency around our long-term incentive targets, the updates we provide on strategy, and the links to remuneration. With this in mind, we have taken strides to improve these disclosures and we hope you will find that your concerns have been addressed with the detail on pages 139 and 140.\n\n## Wider workforce activities\n\nbp aspires to offer a well-balanced, progressive and structured approach to reward, with appropriate variations by business area and location. We also find that the 'non-financial' reward elements are essential to a supportive culture, with the wellbeing of staff and family playing an increasingly prominent role in bp's employment proposition.\n\nAs part of the programme of board/workforce engagement, we held two engagement sessions with a cross-section of UK and global employees in 2021. In these, members of the committee heard views on remuneration matters and a broad range of other topics including job satisfaction, career development, the transformation and culture. In addition, as covered elsewhere on pages 95 and 96, other board members hosted a variety of engagement sessions with selected members of the workforce, throughout 2021.\n\nEmployees were candid and constructive, which gave us confidence in the outlook and culture of the company. They showed tremendous commitment and rose to the occasion during the pandemic. However, attitudes regarding career\n\nand reward are changing in the aftermath and we must respond accordingly, evolving the reward structures, career opportunities and people processes which are described in more detail on page 126.\n\nIn last year's report we covered our aim to grant a one-off share award to every bp employee in 2021, vesting in 2025. This reflected our belief in investing for success broadly while aligning employees' longer-term interests with those of all shareholders. Having delivered on this ambition, we were delighted to see these awards win the ProShare Awards for Best International Share Plan and for Best Overall Performance in Fostering Employee Share Ownership for a company of over 50,000 employees. Our employees throughout bp have demonstrated their commitment to contribute towards the company's recovery and future performance; seeing the share price recover and the value of their shares increase is a source of optimism about the future.\n\n## Other matters\n\nFor the most part this report looks back at the performance pay outcomes to the end of 2021 and is largely silent on the board's decision, announced on 27 February 2022, to exit its shareholding in Rosneft. The board believes that this decision is in the best long-term interests of all our shareholders. The changes to bp's financial reporting and finances will be determined in the first quarter of 2022 which may, in turn, affect some of the performance measures and targets that drive incentive pay outcomes for the entire organization. Therefore, at the end of 2022, the committee will carefully consider the impact of this decision, taken under extraordinary circumstances by the board itself, and we expect to make adjustments, where appropriate, to bring this into account.\n\nSeparately, I would like to acknowledge the many outstanding contributions Brendan Nelson made to our work prior to his retirement from the board last year. He was always a source of analytically sound and well-balanced advice and his presence is greatly missed. At the same time, we are fortunate to have Tushar Morzaria join the committee and bring a fresh perspective and new valuable insights to our deliberations.\n\nAs ever, we hope you find our report informative. We welcome feedback from you and, where there are material issues of disagreement, the chance to discuss those differences with an eye to finding common ground. In closing, we ask for your support of this directors' remuneration report, and the decisions described herein, at the forthcoming annual general meeting.\n\n## Paula Rosput Reynolds\n\nChair of the remuneration committee 18 March 2022",

        "page_content": "## Alignment with our strategy and investor proposition\n\nIt is always challenging to design a remuneration policy that will remain fit for purpose throughout a three-year period. In general, the committee believes our 2020 remuneration policy covers the right components and has flexibility to act in service of our transitioning business. In discussions with shareholders most recently, we identified several areas where greater clarity in the 2023 policy will be beneficial. So, rather than simply use our flexibility, we will handle clarifications in the renewal process. For now, we believe we have the flexibility to address most circumstances that have arisen.\n\nOverall, the current policy reflects the five broad themes that emerged from our engagement with shareholders:\n\n- \u00b7 Aligns strategy, performance, shareholders' experience, and reward outcomes\n- \u00b7 Benchmarks company performance to the performance of peers who are also undergoing transition\n- \u00b7 Uses clear measures to reflect bp's operating and financial progress\n- \u00b7 Provides measures to monitor progress in the energy transition and reductions to carbon impact\n- \u00b7 Provides committee discretion to respond to the economic environment through the energy transition.\n\n## How we achieve this\n\nThroughout the year, the board reviews and discusses company strategy as well as monitors company performance. The board receives significant shareholder input and we also consider independent analysis available on bp's strategy and performance as we discuss and debate the options. These deliberations culminate in agreed-upon annual plans and multi-year deployment of capital. In turn, this work forms the basis of the goals and measures the committee adopts for the annual bonus and performance share awards. The outcomes of these incentive arrangements are largely governed through two performance scorecards, each comprising of clear measures and targets relating to safety, sustainability, operational, strategic and financial performance. At the end of each performance period, the committee assesses quantitative performance outcomes relative to targets, and reviews the qualitative strategic accomplishments. To conclude whether any discretionary adjustment is appropriate, we then make an 'underpin' assessment to consider safety outcomes and, more broadly, how the result aligns with shareholder experience, environmental stewardship, and societal obligations and expectations.\n\nAligning pay outcomes to results delivered is among the most important tasks that the committee undertakes. Our commitment is to oversee this alignment with care, and to explain the basis for the judgements we make.\n\n## Flexibility through the transition\n\nGenerating cash from our resilient hydrocarbons business is the foundation for growth areas. We expect to be directing more than 40% or more of our investment into our transition growth businesses. The reallocation of spend to these future-facing endeavours will be a gradual and non-linear matter, requiring flexibility and judgement from the leadership team. From a committee perspective, as more fully discussed on pages 123 and 124, we must apply judgement in assessing this strategic progress, knowing that there are many factors that impinge on management's judgement as to the pace and scope of change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor our most senior leaders, remuneration measures are aligned with our strategy, shown above, while maintaining a balance with delivery against the financial frame of our investor proposition, and with our core value, safety. Our measures and weightings across the bonus plans and three performance share plan cycles under the 2020 policy remain largely unchanged, bringing about continuity for plan participants.\n\n## Alignment of annual bonus scorecards under the 2020 policy\n\n|                                    | 2020  annual bonus   | 2021  annual bonus   | 2022  annual bonus   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Safety, our core value             | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc \uf0fc                  |\n| Strategic progress:                |                      |                      |                      |\n| \u00b7  Resilient hydrocarbons          | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc \uf0fc                  |\n| \u00b7  Convenience and mobility        |                      | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc \uf0fc                  |\n| \u00b7  Low carbon energy               |                      | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc \uf0fc                  |\n| Sustainability                     | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc \uf0fc                  |\n| Financial frame:                   |                      |                      |                      |\n| \u00b7  Cash flow                       | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc \uf0fc                  |\n| \u00b7  Profit                          | \uf0fc                    |                      |                      |\n| \u00b7  Cumulative cash cost  reduction |                      | \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc \uf0fc                  |\n\n## Alignment of performance share scorecards under the 2020 policy\n\n|                                                                                                | 2020-22  performance  shares   | 2021-23  performance  shares   | 2022-24  performance  shares   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Safety, our core value                                                                         | Underpin                       | Underpin                       | Underpin                       |\n| Strategic progress: \u00b7  Resilient hydrocarbons \u00b7  Convenience and mobility \u00b7  Low carbon energy | \uf0fc } 30% \uf0fc \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc } 40% \uf0fc \uf0fc                    | \uf0fc \uf0fc } 40% \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc              |\n| Sustainability                                                                                 | \uf0fc                              | \uf0fc                              | \uf0fc \uf0fc                            |\n| Financial frame: \u00b7  rTSR  \u00b7  ROACE  \u00b7  Adjusted EBIDA CAGR                                     | } 70% \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc                | }                              | 60% \uf0fc \uf0fc } 60% \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc          |\n\nIn this directors' remuneration report EBIDA per share CAGR, free cash flow excluding Deepwater Horizon costs, return on average capital employed, margin share from convenience and electrification and cumulative cash cost reductions are non-GAAP measures.

For overall delivery in 2021, all measures delivered at target or better, with the exception of plant reliability and refining availability which delivered below plan (see pages 122 and 123 for more detail).\n\n|                                                                | Delivery in  2021   | 2025  targets   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Resilient hydrocarbons                                         |                     |                 |\n| Production costs per barrel                                    | $6.82/boe           | ~$6/boe         |\n| Plant reliability                                              | 94%                 | 96%             |\n| Refining availability                                          | 94.8%               | 96%             |\n| Accelerate growth in convenience and mobility                  |                     |                 |\n| Electric vehicle charge points                                 | 13,100              | >40,000         |\n| Strategic convenience sites                                    | 2,150               | ~3,000          |\n| Margin share from convenience and electrification              | 29.1%               | ~35%            |\n| Demonstrate track record, scale and value in low carbon energy |                     |                 |\n| Developed renewables to FID \uf0ab                                  | 4.4GW               | 20GW            |\n| Bioenergy a                                                    | 26mb/d              | 50mb/d          |\n| LNG portfolio \uf0ab a                                              | 18Mtpa              | 25Mtpa          |\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters and remuneration\n\nbp continues to demonstrate significant commitment to ESG matters, not only through the purpose and net zero ambition announced with our new strategy in 2020, but also through the use of relevant measures in the scorecards for annual bonus and long-term incentive plans. Environmental measures involve a focus on both low carbon and on emissions reductions.\n\nThe continued use of safety as an underpin for the long-term incentive plan, and as a measure in the annual bonus plan, speaks to our commitment to social matters in the broadest sense. In 2022, bp is expanding the impact of ESG measures through the introduction of two additional social measures: employee engagement and an improvement in ethnic representation. Recognizing the latter, we realize that, as a global company, the opportunity to become more ethnically diverse deserves the same focus and energy that we have put to gender representation and an inclusive environment. We will embed this commitment by incorporating these measures as part of the long-term incentive plan scorecard for the senior leaders of the company. Looking ahead, the committee will assess the appropriateness of including these social measures in the scorecards for executive directors during the 2023 remuneration policy review.\n\nGovernance is not a specific scorecard measure for management. However, it is woven through our corporate governance framework as described on pages 90-92.",

Murray Auchincloss's salary increased from \u00a3695,000 to \u00a3750,500 from the 2021 annual general meeting. Both the executive directors receive car-related benefits, coverage of tax return preparation, security assistance, insurance and medical benefits.\n\n## Cash in lieu of retirement benefits\n\nFrom their appointment as executive directors, Bernard and Murray ceased to receive any retirement benefits for their service, but receive a cash allowance fixed at 15% of salary. They may choose to direct these allowances into retirement plans at their sole discretion, and the amounts are therefore identified as cash in lieu of retirement benefits in the single figure table. Since that decision was made, and as is described on page 126, bp has made significant changes to the retirement benefits of the wider non-retail workforce in the UK. For our wider non-retail workforce in the UK (54% of the full UK workforce), we increased the flexible cash benefits allowance from 15% to 20% of salary from July 2021. Therefore, the 15% allowance for bp's executive directors may no longer be representative of the wider non-retail workforce in the UK and the committee will review this as part of the 2023 policy review.\n\n## 2021 annual bonus outcome\n\nFor 2021 the committee established a bonus scorecard of six measures across three areas: safety and sustainability, operational, and financial performance. These measures align with our strategy and investor proposition (see page 119 for a detailed illustration).\n\nbp's continued focus on safety delivered a year with record low levels of tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events \uf0ab , finishing the year with a total of 62 events. As part of our overview of formulaic outcomes, we rely on the judgement of the safety and sustainability committee (S&SC) for an evaluation of safety outcomes and this year we have given particular regard to the S&SC analysis of the two fatalities (one workforce and one third-party fatality) related to bp's operations. After review, the S&SC recommended that no adjustment be made and the committee concurred with that view. The S&SC noted that an adjustment should be made if there is a material deterioration in safety and environmental performance, or there have been major incidents that reveal an underlying weakness in safety and environmental management. Emissions reductions were well in excess of target, reflecting a cumulative reduction of almost 5.6 million tonnes since 2017 when we first set goals for emissions reductions. All operating entities within production & operations and shipping contributed to this achievement. Within bpx energy, progress has been made with the reduction of flaring, refining through conversion to green power contracts, and in Angola & North Sea through energy efficiency projects.\n\nAvailability and reliability of our hydrocarbon plants and refining operations were below target outcome, at 94.5%, due to unplanned hydrocarbon plant outages and higher levels of refining maintenance activity. By contrast, margin share from convenience and electrification exceeded target at 29.1%, with a record annual convenience gross margin. This was supported by the addition of over 200 strategic convenience sites and increased average purchase value. bp also continued the roll-out of electric vehicle charge points with nearly half of the 13,100 charge points now either rapid \uf0ab or ultra-fast charging \uf0ab , which are preferred by motorists.\n\nFinancial performance, as measured by free cash flow and cumulative cost reductions, was outstanding. Achieving a free cash flow of $16.36 billion was very strong relative to the environment-adjusted target of $15.42 billion, and full-year earnings delivery was supported by lower capital spend from disciplined capital management and accelerated divestment proceeds. Cumulative cash cost reductions of $3.0 billion were delivered above the plan maximum, $2.8 billion.",

This included a review of free cash flow, noting in particular the adjustments made to financial targets to reflect environmental pricing impacts (thereby avoiding windfall outcomes), and the effects of COVID-19, to better reflect the underlying performance of bp. Taking all of these measures into account, the formulaic outcome was 1.61 out of 2.0, or 80.5% of maximum, and the committee concluded there were no reasons to adjustment this outcome.\n\n## 2021 annual bonus scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Safety and   sustainability 30%                | Operational   20% +                                  | performance  Weighting                                     | +                                | Financial   performance  50%                        | Maximum (2)  =                   | Formulaic score  1.61 out of 2.0  Outcome   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Measures                                       |                                                      |                                                            | Threshold (0)                    | Target (1)                                          |                                  |                                             |\n| Safety and  sustainability  (30% weighting)    | Process safety tier 1  and tier 2 events             | 15%                                                        | 73 events 0                      | 66 events 0.15                                      | 52 events 0.3                    | 62 events 0.19                              |\n| Safety and  sustainability  (30% weighting)    | Sustainable emissions  reductions (million  tonnes)  | 15%                                                        | 4.63  0                          | 4.88 0.15                                           | 5.43 0.3                         | 5.6 million tonnes 0.30                     |\n| Operational  performance  (20% weighting)      | bp-operated reliability  and availability            | 10%                                                        | 94.2% 0                          | 95.3% 0.1                                           | 96.4% 0.2                        | 94.5% 0.03                                  |\n| Operational  performance  (20% weighting)      | Margin share from  convenience and  electrification  | 10%                                                        | 26.10% 0                         | 28.90% 0.1                                          | 31.70% 0.2                       | 29.1% 0.11                                  |\n| Financial  performance  (50% weighting)        | Free cash flow, ex  Deepwater Horizon  costs ($bn)   | 25%                                                        | $14.42bn 0                       | $15.42bn 0.25                                       | $16.42bn 0.5                     | $16.357bn 0.48                              |\n| Financial  performance  (50% weighting)        | Cumulative cash cost  reductions 2021 vs  2019 ($bn) | 25%                                                        | $2.2bn 0                         | $2.5bn 0.25                                         | $2.8bn 0.5                       | $3.0bn 0.5                                  |\n| Formulaic score  1.61 out of 2.0               | Formulaic score  1.61 out of 2.0                     | Formulaic score  1.61 out of 2.0                           | Formulaic score  1.61 out of 2.0 | Formulaic score  1.61 out of 2.0                    | Formulaic score  1.61 out of 2.0 | Formulaic score  1.61 out of 2.0            |\n| Formulaic scorecard   outcome  1.61 out of 2.0 | committee no adjustment                              | Input from audit committee   and safety and sustainability |                                  | Remuneration   committee   judgement  no adjustment |                                  | 80.5% of maximum                            |\n\n## 2019-21 performance share plan outcome\n\nBernard and Murray were granted 2019-21 performance share awards prior to their appointment as executive directors. Therefore, they hold 2019-21 awards under the group share value plan (GSVP) for senior leaders of the company, rather than under the executive director incentive plan (EDIP). However, vesting under both plans is assessed using the same group performance scorecard shown on page 125. The formulaic outcome can then be adjusted on a discretionary basis either by the committee (for executive directors) or the CEO (for senior leaders of the company).\n\nThe scorecard for the 2019-21 cycle - the last under our 2017 shareholder-approved remuneration policy - consists of three measures: rTSR (50%), ROACE (20%) averaged over the three-year period, and four strategic progress imperatives (30%).\n\nOn a formulaic basis, performance against the rTSR and ROACE measures disappointed, yielding nil outcomes.\n\nThe committee closely reviewed the four indicators of strategic progress which, in light of the major strategy shift, required much judgement to bridge achievement of the goals set in 2019 with the ongoing efforts to deliver the new strategy adopted in 2020. We started from a recognition that substantial progress has been made in improving bp's financial condition. The debt reduction achieved in 2021, the strong 2021 ROACE, and the significant reductions in underlying cost base demonstrate that the right foundation has been laid for continued strategic progress. The committee next turned to the dimensions of strategic progress set for the 2019-21 period and examined which remained relevant, what progress had been made, and where the dimensions were no longer strictly applicable. We also considered what other strategic progress could reasonably substitute and be recognized. This latter activity - deciding if there were substitute actions - included the use of both quantitative assessments and qualitative judgements by the committee.\n\nBased on the above considerations and material provided by management, the committee concluded that the strategic progress goals were fully achieved for the 2019-21 performance shares, resulting in full scorecard recognition for this measure. Our assessment of strategic progress is as follows overleaf.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 24-27 for key performance indicators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Progress against the four strategic imperatives:\n\n1. Growing gas and advantaged oil in the upstream. bp aims to invest in new large-scale gas projects, pursue quality oil projects in core basins and seek out new opportunities in selected regions.\n\nbp has indicated that it intends to change its investment plans to dedicate more of its capital to projects with a low or no carbon character. The consequence of this clearly changes the investment pattern of how bp meets the goal described above. We are satisfied that management has made wise choices in this regard. Despite the severe challenges presented by the pandemic, bp's production mix of gas improved from 50% in 2018 to 51% in 2021 and oil project development costs reduced from $17.2/bbl to $15.9/bbl over the same period.\n\nThe company, despite the change in focus, managed the successful start-up of 16 major projects \uf0ab over the three-year period. The oil-related projects deliver lower average development costs while both oil and gas projects deliver lower carbon intensity than the pre-existing portfolio.\n\n- 2. Market-led growth in the downstream. bp aims to innovate with advanced products and strategic partnerships.\n\nThe work to advance what is now convenience & mobility falls well within the ambit of the goal established in 2019. The pandemic presented specific challenges for the customer-focused businesses with fuel sales impacted by demand destruction. However, bp's continued focus on improving its convenience competitive position is evident through the number of strategic convenience sites increasing from 1,400 in 2018 to 2,150 in 2021. With the Thornton's transaction, bp is now a leading operator in the US Midwest. The extension of the UK partnership with Marks & Spencer until at least 2030 provides further confidence that the UK forecourts offer can evolve as customers' behaviour changes.\n\n- 3. Venturing and low carbon across multiple fronts. bp aims to pursue new ventures and partnerships to meet rapidly evolving trends and develop cross-business solutions to create opportunities or strengthen relationships.\n\nThis aspect of bp's ambition has proceeded as it is also highly consistent with bp's revised strategy. Critically, over 3.9MtCO 2 e of sustainable emissions reductions were delivered over the 2019 to 2021 period, an important step in our aim 1 to be net zero across our entire operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner. bp Launchpad continued to build its portfolio of companies in the advanced analytics and energy management space with the acquisition of Open Energi and Blueprint Power. bp ventures continued to create options for bp in new technologies and advanced mobility that will support the energy transition with investments in Lightning eMotors, BluSmart, and IoTecha. Material progress has also been made in creating low carbon businesses, as 3.5GW net offshore wind licences have been secured in the US and Irish Sea. Progress has been made in hydrogen with a 1.3mtpa project hopper built, together with Abu Dhabi partnerships and East Coast Cluster selection. In total 33 projects were delivered to final investment decision (FID) stage during 2021.\n\n- 4. Gas power and renewables trading and marketing growth. bp aims to compete and seize new opportunities with partners and stakeholders in a changing world.\n\nThis goal too is consistent with the revised strategy and significant progress has been made. bp remains the largest US gas and power marketing company and one of the largest in the world; bp also secured a material deal of 250MW of power for the next 15 years. Trading is integrally related to several segments and therefore results are not compiled as a separate business. In fact, bp finished 2021 with increased earnings and a wider footprint of trading. Moreover, the increase in the scope of renewables trading has been significant. As the world recognizes the value of natural gas as a transition fuel, bp has added three advanced LNG tankers to the bp-operated fleet since 2019, grown US Gulf Coast liquefaction capacity by 7.4mtpa and more than doubled the number of non-equity LNG cargoes versus 2018 levels.\n\n## Other vesting considerations\n\nAlong with the results from the scorecard measures, the committee considers an 'underpin' to the formulaic outcome in order to determine the final vesting percentage. The underpin broadens our performance assessment, allowing us to consider overall alignment with absolute shareholder returns, environmental and safety factors (including fatalities) and progress in low carbon and climate change matters. Where relevant, we take input from the safety and sustainability committee and the audit committee to deepen our perspective.\n\nHaving considered the above matters, we concluded that there was no reason to apply a discretionary adjustment to the formulaic vesting outcome for the executive directors, and that the plan should vest in line with the scorecard outcome at 30% of maximum. This yields the outcomes shown in the table below. The scorecard detail is shown on page 125.\n\n## 2019-21 performance share plan outcomes (audited)\n\n|                      | Shares  awarded a   | Shares  vesting  including  dividends   | Value of  vested  shares, Feb  2022   | Impact of  share price change b   |\n|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Bernard Looney       | 167,960             | 122,120                                 | \u00a3493,365                              | -\u00a3145,117                         |\n| Murray Auchincloss c | 78,234              | 57,066                                  | \u00a3224,611                              | -\u00a362,856                          |\n\nThe value of vested shares reflects the share price changes all shareholders have experienced over the three-year period. For this 2019-21 award cycle, the original grant was calculated based on ordinary share and ADS prices of \u00a35.48 and $43.53 respectively, while the values at vesting were \u00a34.04 and $32.48 on 16 February 2022 (see page 129 for more detail). Consequently, the share price fall has reduced the initial face value of these awards by approximately 26% for ordinary shares and 25% for ADSs. The committee has made no discretionary adjustments to vesting outcomes related to these share price changes.",

In planning these engagement sessions we looked for diversity of input across multiple fronts: including type of role, tenure, location, and nationality. At these sessions we discussed bp's purpose and ambition, and how this aligns with the organization's reward programmes. In one of these sessions, we focused on the impact of changes to the UK reward package implemented during the year.\n\nOur enquiries ranged from success in attracting and retaining talent, employee preferences in how pay is delivered, the structure of the reward package, and bp's programmes for international mobility. A recurring theme in the discussions was employees' desire for flexibility, with empowerment to make individual choices about both work and pay.\n\nDuring 2021 bp conducted a full review of the reward package available to the wider non-retail workforce in the UK. The company completed the final step in closing its defined benefit pension plan, which had remained open for legacy employees only, and adopted a flexible cash-in-lieu benefit arrangement instead. This allowed the company to improve the consistency of benefits across the wider non-retail workforce in the UK, thus increasing the cash-in-lieu value from 15% to 20% of salary. The 20% allowance applies to the wider non-retail workforce in the UK only; bp's retail employee population are automatically enrolled in the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST), a UK defined contribution pension plan which is aligned with the typical market practice for UK retail businesses. In the interest of fairness, bp has not set a minimum earnings threshold for this population and allows all of the retail population to participate.\n\nThe fact two very separate schemes exist in the UK does complicate the definition of 'wider workforce' in determining the qualifying benefit for executive directors. As mentioned on page 122 we will seek to address this matter as part of the 2023 policy review.\n\nWe were also pleased to note the enthusiasm felt for the one-off share grant made to every bp employee in 2021. These awards, due to vest in 2025, reflect a belief that employees should be personally invested in the value that can be created through bp's reinvention, thus aligning their longer-term interests with all shareholders.\n\nLooking beyond direct pay into the broader employee proposition, we note the strong emphasis on maintaining a supportive and inclusive working environment, and a general 'culture of care'. For instance, we note bp's commitment to family-friendly leave policies, recognition of bp as a top global employer in Stonewall's list of the best multinational employers for LGBT+ staff, and a fourth consecutive 100% score in the Human Rights Campaign's 2021 Corporate Equality Index which measures adoption of non-discrimination policies, equitable benefits for LGBT+ employees and families, and supporting an inclusive culture and corporate social responsibility. We are also delighted that bp is and continues to be accredited by the Living Wage Foundation as a real Living Wage employer in the UK. bp is actively developing plans for an equivalent global standard on fair/living wages. With all these programmes bp seeks to avoid bias through the design of appropriate reward programmes and processes.\n\nWe have reviewed data from bp's gender and ethnicity pay gap analyses and are satisfied that, while there are pay gaps, these are mainly attributable to difference in representation across the pay hierarchy and not an indicator of bias in programmes or decision-making. As the gender and ethnicity report has already been published on the company's website bp.com , and with bp's ongoing commitment to annual diversity, equity and inclusion reporting (first published in 2021), we won't expand any further here.\n\nIn conclusion, we find bp employees are positively engaged by their work and conditions, and that the pay structures summarized on page 127 are well-balanced for employees' needs. Approaches to pay vary by business area and location and therefore the following table covers the 'core' offering for the majority of the workforce.",

As per the last two years, we have selected Option A as our reporting basis, being the most accurate approach available, and we confirm that no broadly applicable components of pay have been omitted. Where necessary, part year or part time pay has been adjusted by a simple engrossment of part-year or part time values to get to a full time equivalent number. Employee values relate to pay and benefits for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nThere was a substantial decrease in the 50th percentile from 2019 to 2020 (188:1 to. 40:1), with an increase from 2020 to 2021 of 40:1 to 87:1. These changes reflect the fact that CEO remuneration is more heavily weighted to variable pay, resulting in larger year-on-year swings than wider workforce pay. This is a natural reason for volatility in pay ratio reporting from year to year, and illustrates one of the challenges in commenting on whether pay differentials are appropriate. Our considered view as to appropriateness is that the policies for our CEO, and for the wider workforce, are both fit for purpose and that they deliver pay outcomes appropriate to the circumstances of the year, with differentials that reflect the relative contributions made at different levels in our organization.\n\nTaken in the round and with all of the insights gained into pay policies and practices, the committee is satisfied that the median pay ratio reported this year is consistent with bp's pay policies for employees and does not constitute a reason to modify our pay programmes.\n\n## Percentage change comparisons: directors' remuneration versus employees\n\nIn the table below, values in column 'a' represent the percentage change in salary and fees; values in column 'b' represent the percentage change in taxable benefits including business travel costs; and values in column 'c' represent the percentage change in bonus outcomes for performance periods in respect of each financial year. The employee percentages shown below represent the relative change between the mean full-time equivalent pay for every employee employed in bp p.l.c. at any point during the relevant financial year, and the equivalent mean value for the preceding financial year.\n\nFor the chair and non-executive directors, the increase in the value of taxable benefits reflects the resumption of business travel in 2021. There is no correlating increase in the employee percentage change because travel cost reimbursements do not constitute taxable benefits for employees.\n\n|                            | 2021 v 2020   | 2021 v 2020   | 2021 v 2020   | 2020 v 2019   | 2020 v 2019   | 2020 v 2019   |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Percentage change for:     | a             | b             | c             | a             | b             | c             |\n| Employees                  | 7%            | -9%           | 100%          | 0%            | 0%            | -100%         |\n| Bernard Looney             | 2%            | -29%          | 100%          | -             | -             | -             |\n| Murray Auchincloss         | 5%            | 5%            | 100%          | -             | -             | -             |\n| Dame Alison Carnwath       | 0%            | -100%         | n/a           | -4%           | -94%          | n/a           |\n| Pamela Daley               | 4%            | 1385%         | n/a           | -15%          | -92%          | n/a           |\n| Professor Dame Ann Dowling | 0%            | -100%         | n/a           | -4%           | -96%          | n/a           |\n| Helge Lund (chair)         | 0%            | -24%          | n/a           | 0%            | -74%          | n/a           |\n| Melody Meyer               | -4%           | 283%          | n/a           | 9%            | -77%          | n/a           |\n| Tushar Morzaria            | 5%            | 0%            | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           |\n| Brendan Nelson             | 14%           | -100%         | n/a           | -7%           | -71%          | n/a           |\n| Paula Rosput Reynolds      | 6%            | 228%          | n/a           | 2%            | -92%          | n/a           |\n| Karen Richardson           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | -             |\n| Sir John Sawers            | 0%            | 1588%         | n/a           | 0%            | -83%          | n/a           |\n| Johannes Teyssen           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | -             |\n\nDame Alison Carnwath, Professor Dame Ann Dowling and Brendan Nelson resigned during 2021, therefore, other than for one-time items, their 2021 pay has been annualized for comparison.

These figures include all beneficial and non-beneficial ownership of shares of bp (or calculated equivalents) that have been disclosed to the company, but exclude shares delivered under 2019-21 performance share awards (as these are included in the performance shares table below).\n\n| Director           | Ordinary  shares or  equivalents  at 1 Jan  2021   | Ordinary  shares or  equivalents  at 31 Dec  2021   | Changes  from 31 Dec  2021 to  1 Mar 2022   | Ordinary  shares or  equivalents  at 1 Mar  2022   | Appointment  date   | Value of  current  shareholding a   | Multiple  of salary  achieved   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Bernard Looney     | 331,711                                            | 544,919                                             | 228,791                                     | 773,710                                            | 5 Feb 2020          | \u00a32,762,145                          | 2.07x                           |\n| Murray Auchincloss | 139,525                                            | 286,870                                             | 104,537                                     | 391,407                                            | 1 Jul 2020          | \u00a31,397,323                          | 1.86x                           |\n\nThe executive directors have additional interests in restricted and performance shares. These interests are shown in aggregate, and by plan, in the tables below. For performance shares, the figures reflect maximum possible vesting levels (excluding the addition of reinvested dividends) even though the actual number of shares that vest will depend on the extent to which performance conditions are satisfied.\n\n## Aggregated interests, all plans (audited)\n\n| Director           | Unvested  ordinary  shares or  equivalents  at 1 Jan  2021   | Unvested  ordinary  shares or  equivalents  as 31 Dec  2021   | Changes  from 31 Dec  2021 to  1 Mar 2022   | Unvested  ordinary  shares or  equivalents  at 1 Mar  2022   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bernard Looney     | 3,193,599                                                    | 4,882,082                                                     | -293,650                                    | 4,588,432                                                    |\n| Murray Auchincloss | 1,581,899                                                    | 2,447,213                                                     | -81,662                                     | 2,365,551                                                    |\n\n## Performance shares (audited)\n\n|                    |                     |                        | Share element interests                | Share element interests                | Share element interests                | Interests vested in 2022   | Interests vested in 2022   | Interests vested in 2022   |\n|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                    |                     | Date of award          | Potential maximum performance shares a | Potential maximum performance shares a | Potential maximum performance shares a | Number                     |                            |                            |\n|                    | Performance  period | of performance  shares | At 1 Jan  2021                         | Awarded  2021                          | At 31 Dec  2021                        | of ordinary  shares vested | Vesting date               | Face value of  award b , \u00a3 |\n| Bernard Looney     | 2019-21 c           | 25 Mar 2019            | 335,920                                | -                                      | 335,920                                | 122,120                    | 16 Feb 2022                | -                          |\n|                    | 2020-22 d d         | 11 Aug 2020            | 2,076,677                              | -                                      | 2,076,677                              | -                          | -                          | 6,396,165                  |\n|                    | 2021-23             | 1 Jun 2021             | -                                      | 2,218,853                              | 2,218,853                              | -                          | -                          | 6,989,387                  |\n| Murray Auchincloss | 2019-21 ce          | 25 Mar 2019            | 156,468                                | -                                      | 156,468                                | 57,066                     | 16 Feb 2022                | -                          |\n|                    | 2020-22 d           | 11 Aug 2020            | 999,201                                | -                                      | 999,201                                | -                          | -                          | 3,077,539                  |\n|                    | 2021-23 d           | 1 Jun 2021             | -                                      | 1,122,009                              | 1,122,009                              | -                          | -                          | 3,534,328                  |",

At 1 March 2022, bp's directors and leadership team members collectively held interests of: 4,147,295 ordinary shares or their calculated equivalents; 7,192,952 restricted share units (with or without conditions) or their calculated equivalents; 6,874,211 performance shares or their calculated equivalents; and 5,953,999 options over ordinary shares or their calculated equivalents, under bp share option schemes.\n\n## Post-employment share ownership interests\n\nBob Dudley and Brian Gilvary have, and continued to retain, significant interests in bp post employment. They gave their personal commitment as executive directors to maintain actual holdings equivalent to two and a half times salary for two years post employment. That commitment is guaranteed by the fact that their anticipated interests in share awards under group plans which remain subject to vesting and/or holding periods at the time they left bp exceeded the two and a half times salary threshold. Although we instituted a formal post-employment share ownership requirement as part of our 2020 policy, given the foregoing, we have not modified the requirements for these former executives.",

However, its implementation was postponed on account of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by bp in response.\n\nFollowing board approval, the remuneration arrangements for the NEDs have been adjusted with effect from 1 January 2022 as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The annual base fee for board members has been increased to \u00a3115,000.\n- \u00b7 The annual fee for the senior independent director has been increased to \u00a3160,000.\n- \u00b7 The annual fee for committee chairs has been increased to \u00a335,000.\n- \u00b7 The intercontinental travel allowance has been removed.\n\nThe levels of the new fee arrangement were benchmarked against UK peers. The annual base fee and fee for committee chairs were last increased in 2012, and the base fee for the senior independent director has not increased since 2007. The intercontinental travel allowance was removed to ensure greater simplicity and transparency in NED fee arrangements. The chair requested that his fees were not increased at this time.\n\nAs disclosed in our 2020 report and reflected in the table below, a fee for membership of the people and governance committee was introduced with effect from 1 January 2021. The senior independent director has waived her entitlement to this committee membership fee. The fee structure for 2022 remains otherwise unchanged and the board will review the situation again during the year.\n\n## Fee structure\n\nThe table below shows the fee structure for the chair and NEDs, per our 2020 policy. The chair is not eligible for committee chairship and membership fees or intercontinental travel allowance.\n\n|                                                                               |   2021 fees  \u00a3 thousand per annum | 2022 fees  \u00a3 thousand per annum   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Chair                                                                         |                               785 | 785                               |\n| Senior independent director a                                                 |                               120 | 160                               |\n| Board member                                                                  |                                90 | 115                               |\n| Audit, remuneration and safety and sustainability committees chairship fees b |                                30 | 35                                |\n| Committee membership fee                                                      |                                20 | 20                                |\n| Intercontinental travel allowance                                             |                                 5 | -                                 |\n\n## 2021 remuneration (audited)\n\nThe table below shows the fees paid and applicable benefits for the year ended 31 December 2021.

These relate to performance share awards made under the Executive Director Incentive Plan, and to the deferred share elements of prior year annual bonuses.\n\n## Performance shares\n\nBob and Brian are both regarded as 'good leavers' under the terms of the performance share plan, and therefore received shares upon vesting of the 2019-21 performance share plan, as detailed on pages 123-125. Their share vesting has been pro-rated to reflect their periods of actual service, relative to the three-year cycle. Outcomes are as follows:\n\n|               | Performance  period   | Date of award  of performance  shares   | Shares  originally  granted   | Vesting date   | Value of   shares vested  (including  dividends)   |\n|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Bob Dudley a  | 2019-21               | 19 Feb 2019                             | 1,340,766                     | 16 Feb 2022    | $1,102,826                                         |\n| Brian Gilvary | 2019-21               | 19 Feb 2019                             | 654,315                       | 16 Feb 2022    | \u00a3480,493                                           |\n\n## Deferred shares from prior year bonuses\n\nAs previously reported, Bob Dudley requested that the final assessment and vesting determination of various share awards related to annual bonus outcomes from 2014 to 2019, be deferred until at least one year post retirement. Similarly, Brian Gilvary made the same request of his 2016 matching share award, and that his 2015 matching share award be deferred for an additional two years. Thus the committee extended the original safety and environmental sustainability performance conditions for these awards in line with the extended deferral.\n\nOf these voluntary deferrals, awards under the 2014 policy were not reportable in the single figures of total remuneration for the performance years in question (relating to bonus years 2014, 2015 and 2016), but fall instead to be disclosed on vesting.",

Further detail on the activities of the committee, advice received, and shareholder engagement is set out in the remuneration committee report on page 116.\n\nDuring 2021 Ben Mathews, who was employed by the company and reported to the chair of the board, acted as secretary to the remuneration committee.\n\nThe committee also received advice on various matters relating to the remuneration of executive directors and senior management from Kerry Dryburgh, EVP people and culture and Ashok Pillai, SVP reward and wellbeing.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) continued to provide independent advice to the committee in 2021, following its appointment as independent advisor to the committee in September 2017 following a competitive tender process. PwC advice included, for example, support with remuneration benchmarking and updates on market practice. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent. The committee is comfortable that the PwC engagement partner and team who provides remuneration advice to the committee do not have connections with the company or its directors that may impair their independence.\n\nTotal fees or other charges (based on an hourly rate) for the provision of remuneration advice to the committee in 2021 (save in respect of legal advice) were \u00a380,121 to PwC. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (Freshfields) provided legal advice on specific compliance matters to the committee. PwC and Freshfields provide other advice in their respective areas to the group.\n\n## Considerations related to the Corporate Governance Code\n\nWhen setting the 2020 policy, the committee concluded that the scorecard based approach to setting targets and measuring outcomes provides great clarity in our ability to engage transparently with shareholders and the wider workforce on remuneration. Thus, bp continues to operate a simple structure of market-aligned salary with annual and three-year performance-based incentives. Risks are managed through careful setting of performance measures and targets and broad flexibility to apply committee discretion in assessing outcomes. These are complemented with robust malus and clawback measures. Remuneration outcomes are predictable, as shown in the scenario charts of the 2020 policy, and proportional by virtue of the challenging performance levels required to achieve target pay outcomes. Through material weighting in measures related to safety, sustainability and strategy, as shown on page 119, remuneration aligns closely with bp's culture, as expressed through our purpose and ambition.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay ($ million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a Organic capital expenditure",

Subject to mutual agreement, they are each expected to serve a further three years, and normally up to nine years from appointment in line with the provisions of the 2018 Code, subject to annual re-election.\n\n## External appointments\n\nThe board supports executive directors taking up appointments outside the company to broaden their knowledge and experience. Each executive director is permitted to retain any fee from their external appointments. Such external appointments are subject to agreement by the chair and reported to the board. Any external appointment must not conflict with a director's duties and commitments to bp.

        "page_content": "## Directors' statements\n\n## Statement of directors' responsibilities\n\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. The directors are required by the UK Companies Act 2006 to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and the parent company and the financial performance and cash flows of the group and parent company for that period. Under that law they are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the United Kingdom) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice), including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'. In preparing the consolidated financial statements the directors have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU).\n\nIn preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.\n- \u00b7 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.\n- \u00b7 Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information.\n- \u00b7 Provide additional disclosure when compliance with the specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group's financial position and financial performance.\n- \u00b7 State that applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company and enable them to ensure that the consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and the parent company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nHaving made the requisite enquiries, so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the company's auditors are unaware, and the directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nEach of the current directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 84 to 87, confirms that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 The consolidated financial statements, prepared on the basis of IFRS as issued by the IASB, IFRS as adopted by the United Kingdom and EU and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under international accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group.\n- \u00b7 The parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, performance and cash flows of the company.\n- \u00b7 The management report, which is incorporated in the strategic report and directors' report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nChair 18 March 2022\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code compliance\n\nThroughout 2021, bp applied the principles and provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code ('Code'). It has complied with all provisions of the Code, except for provision 4, which sets out that an update on a significant vote against the board recommendation for a resolution should be given no later than six months after the shareholder meeting. Further details can be found on page 93. The Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council website: www.frc.org.uk .\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nUnder the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (Code), the board is responsible for the company's risk management and internal control systems. In discharging this responsibility the board, through its governance principles, requires the chief executive officer to operate the company with a comprehensive system of controls and internal audit to identify and manage the risks including emerging risks that are material to bp. In turn, the board, through its monitoring processes, satisfies itself that these material risks are identified and understood by management and that systems of risk management and internal control are in place to mitigate them. These systems are reviewed periodically by the board, have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of this report and are consistent with the requirements of Principle O of the Code.\n\nThe board has processes in place to:\n\n- \u00b7 Assess the principal and emerging risks facing the company.\n- \u00b7 Monitor the company's system of internal control (which includes the ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal and emerging risks).\n- \u00b7 Review the effectiveness of that system annually.\n\nNon-operated joint ventures and associates \uf0ab have not been dealt with as part of this process.\n\nA description of the principal and emerging risks facing the company, including those that could potentially threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, is set out in Risk factors on page 76. During the year, the board undertook a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the company. The principal means by which these risks are managed or mitigated are set out on page 73.",

        "page_content": "In assessing the risks faced by the company and monitoring the system of internal control, the board and the audit and safety and sustainability committees requested, received and reviewed reports from executive management, including management of the business segments, corporate activities and any functions, at their regular meetings. A report by each of these committees, including its activities during the year, is set out on pages 107-115.\n\nDuring the year, the committees, as relevant, also met with management, the SVP internal audit and other monitoring and assurance functions (including group ethics and compliance, safety and operational risk, group control, group legal and group risk) and the external auditor. Responses by management to incidents that occurred were considered by the appropriate committee or the board.\n\nAt a meeting in March 2022, the audit committee considered reports from the group risk function on the system of internal control and the function's categorisation of significant failings or weaknesses. The audit committee also considered a report from internal audit on their assessment of bp's systems of internal control and risk management, based on audit work conducted during 2021. In considering these reports and assessments, the audit committee noted that bp's system of internal control and risk management is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nThe board then considered the review undertaken by the audit committee and the proposed disclosures outlining the company's risk management and internal control systems prior to publication of the annual report and accounts.\n\nA statement regarding the company's internal controls over financial reporting is set out on page 362.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\n## Longer-term viability\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 of the Code, the directors have assessed the prospects of the company over a period significantly longer than 12 months. The directors believe that, notwithstanding bp's new strategy and the associated 2025 and 2030 net zero carbon targets and aims that it set out in 2020, a viability assessment period of three years remains appropriate. This assessment is based on management's reasonable expectations of the position and performance of the company over this period, it's internal detailed budgets and planning timeframes and the targets and aims that it has set out.\n\nOur risk management system, described in how we manage risk on page 73, outlines our risk identification, assessment and management approach for all risks, including our principal risks, described on page 76.\n\nTaking into account the company's current position and its principal risks, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.\n\nThe directors' assessment included a review of the potential financial impact of, and the financial headroom that could be available in the event of, the most severe but plausible scenarios that could threaten the viability of the company. The assessment took into consideration the robust financial position of the group and the potential mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available to the company over this period. Mitigations considered include use of cash, access to debt facilities and credit lines, raising of capital, reductions in capital expenditure, divestments and dividend reductions.\n\nThe scenarios that have been modelled are based on the most severe but plausible outcomes and associated costs are based on actual experience where possible. The scenarios have been considered individually and as a cluster of events. They include:\n\n- \u00b7 a significant process safety incident when operating facilities, drilling wells or transporting hydrocarbons.\n- \u00b7 a sustained significant decline in oil prices over three years.\n- \u00b7 a significant cyber-security incident.\n- \u00b7 a loss of a significant market or producing asset for six months.\n\nThe directors also considered the impact on viability from an extended pandemic scenario, as well as the potential risks associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. They consider that the most likely impacts of these risks are broadly captured and modelled through the sustained low oil price and loss of a producing asset scenarios.\n\nIn assessing the prospects of the company, the directors noted that such assessment is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe board considers the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn accordance with provision 30 of the Code, the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. The current economic and geopolitical environment, as well as the ongoing impact of COVID-19, were considered as part of the going concern assessment. Forecast liquidity has been assessed under a number of stressed scenarios to support this assertion. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements even if the Brent price fell to zero.

Opinion\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 The financial statements of BP p.l.c. (the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group') give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2021 and of the group's profit for the year then ended.\n- \u00b7 The group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n- \u00b7 The parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice), including Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n- \u00b7 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of BP p.l.c. which comprise the:\n\n- \u00b7 group and parent company income statements\n- \u00b7 group and parent company statements of comprehensive income\n- \u00b7 group and parent company statements of changes in equity\n- \u00b7 group and parent company balance sheets\n- \u00b7 group cash flow statement\n- \u00b7 group related Notes 1 to 37 to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and\n- \u00b7 parent company related Notes 1 to 14 to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law, United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and IFRSs as issued by the IASB. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice), including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n\n## 2. Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the group and parent company for the year are disclosed in Note 35 to the financial statements. We confirm that apart from the matter disclosed below, we have not provided any other non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard to the group or the parent company.\n\nWe have identified one regulatory breach of audit independence rules, which involved Deloitte South Africa providing fraud and ethics hotline services to a bp subsidiary for an annual fee of approximately $1,000. The service included the answering of calls and the reporting of information gathered to management. The service is administrative in nature and there is no analysis or judgement applied to the information that is reported back to management. The impact of the service to this insignificant affiliate was immaterial and inconsequential and accordingly, we identified no specific risks to our independence. Therefore, we have concluded in agreement with the Audit Committee that our objectivity and impartiality has not been impaired, and we believe that a reasonable and informed third party with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that we are capable of exercising objective and impartial judgement on all matters related to the audit.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n146",

        "page_content": "## 3. Summary of our audit approach\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nThe key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:\n\n## Materiality\n\n## Scoping\n\n- \u00b7 potential impact of climate change and the energy transition\n- \u00b7 impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets\n- \u00b7 decommissioning provisions\n- \u00b7 accounting for complex transactions executed by the trading and shipping (T&S) function to deliver against the wider group strategy and valuation of commodity financial derivatives, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition (potentially impacting all financial statement accounts, in particular finance debt)\n- \u00b7 IT controls relating to financial systems and\n- \u00b7 management override of controls.\n\nThis year we identified decommissioning provisions as a key audit matter, given the high level of general inflation, a legal decision in the US that potentially increases the risk of decommissioning costs reverting to the group in respect of prior asset disposals and our ongoing challenge of management's judgement that decommissioning provisions are not required for refineries as their decommissioning date is indeterminate.\n\nWe have not included a key audit matter in respect of the write-off of exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets this year as there has been no repeat of the $9.9 billion write-off in the prior year. Our ongoing challenge as to whether development of the remaining $4.3 billion of E&A assets is consistent with bp's stated strategy is covered in our climate change key audit matter. We have not included a separate COVID-19 key audit matter again this year as bp now has a track record of identifying and managing the challenges posed by COVID-19 and the areas of our audit significantly impacted by COVID-19 are covered by the other key audit matters in this report. All other key audit matters are consistent with those we identified in the prior year.\n\nThe materiality that we used for the group financial statements was $700 million (2020 $600 million) which was determined based on profit before tax and underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.\n\nIn the prior year we determined materiality based on net assets given the significant losses incurred as a consequence, inter alia, of the COVID-19 pandemic and in particular the low oil and gas prices.\n\nOur scope covered 226 consolidation units (cons units). Of these, 174 were full-scope audits and the remaining 52 were subject to specific procedures on certain account balances by component audit teams or the group audit team. These covered 74% of group revenue, 76% of PP&E and 72% of profit before tax. The remaining 630 cons units were subject to other procedures, including performing analytical reviews, making inquiries, and evaluating and testing management's group-wide controls.\n\n## 4. Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 considering whether material uncertainties existed that could cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months after the date of approval of the financial statements\n- \u00b7 assessing the financing facilities including nature of facilities, repayment terms and covenants\n- \u00b7 challenging the assumptions used in the forecast (in particular oil and gas prices, capital expenditure, production levels and debt repayments)\n- \u00b7 assessing management's identified potential mitigating actions and the appropriateness of the inclusion of these in the going concern assessment\n- \u00b7 testing the clerical accuracy and appropriateness of the model used to prepare the forecasts\n- \u00b7 assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management\n- \u00b7 reperforming management's sensitivity analysis and\n- \u00b7 confirming the disclosures made within the financial statements.\n\nBased on our assessment, we concluded that the assumptions used by management were reasonable overall and the disclosures made within the financial statements were appropriate.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## 5. Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nThroughout the course of our audit, we identify risks of material misstatement ('risks'). We consider both the likelihood of a risk and the potential magnitude of a misstatement in making the assessment. Certain risks are classified as 'significant' or 'higher' depending on their severity. The category of the risk determines the level of evidence we seek in providing assurance that the associated financial statement item is not materially misstated.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n147",

        "page_content": "The matters described below were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## 5.1 Potential Impact of climate change and the energy transition (impacting PP&E, goodwill, intangible assets and provisions)\n\nKey audit matter description\n\nClimate change impacts bp's business in a number of ways as set out in the strategic report on pages 2-80 of the Annual Report and Note 1 of the financial statements on page 178. It represents a strategic challenge and a key focus of management. The related risks that we have identified for our audit are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Forecast assumptions used in assessing the value-in-use of oil and gas PP&E assets within bp's balance sheet for impairment testing, particularly oil and gas price assumptions and their interrelationship with forecast emissions costs, may not appropriately reflect changes in supply and demand due to climate change and the energy transition (see 'impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets' below).\n- \u00b7 The timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures in respect of oil and gas assets may need to be brought forward with a resulting increase in the present value of the associated liabilities due to the impact of climate change. In addition, provisions for decommissioning and asset retirement obligations of oil and gas PP&E may increase as a result of possible exposure to decommissioning obligations that may revert back to bp in respect of assets transferred to third parties through historical divestments. The risk of possible exposure is enhanced due to the impacts of climate change which have heightened liquidity and financial resilience concerns for many industry participants. Furthermore, provisions for decommissioning refining assets, previously not generally recognised on the basis that the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions in demand due to climate change curtail their operational lives; (see 'Decommissioning provisions' below).\n- \u00b7 The recoverability of certain of the group's $4.3 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised at 31 December 2021 (2020 $4.1 billion, following $9.9 billion of pre-tax write-offs and impairments recorded during the prior year) are potentially exposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors (see Note 14). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed as a consequence of lower forecast future oil and gas prices, bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 40% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 17), the group's 'no exploration in new countries' commitment, and potentially increased objections from stakeholders to the development of certain projects. The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be written off, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex, continues to require significant management judgement and is a higher audit risk for certain E&A projects.\n- \u00b7 The carrying value of the group's refining assets within PP&E may no longer be recoverable, due to changes in supply and demand which arise as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition, for example the adoption of electric vehicles in markets where bp has significant fuel refining activity. Management identified impairment indicators in respect of each of its refineries during the year. As a result, impairment tests were performed to assess the recoverability of each of these refineries' carrying value. As disclosed in Note 3 to the accounts on page 200, management has recorded impairment charges of $962 million in the Customers & Products (C&P) segment, which primarily related to their refining assets.\n- \u00b7 bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 40% by 2030 relative to 2019) and the group's wider strategy includes potentially disposing of certain high emissions intensity upstream oil assets and others. As a consequence, certain assets may need to be assessed for impairment based on their estimated disposal proceeds from a third party, as opposed to their value-in-use to bp. Management recorded $1.1 billion of pre-tax impairment charges in 2021 for such potential disposals as described in Note 3. There is an audit risk that management judgements taken to determine whether impairment charges are required based on bp's view of whether transactions are likely to proceed or not, and bp's strategic appetite regarding the value of disposal consideration that would be accepted, are not reasonable.\n- \u00b7 The useful economic lives of the group's refining assets may be shortened as society moves towards 'net zero' emissions targets and bp seeks to achieve its net-zero ambition, such that the depreciation charge is materially understated. As disclosed in Note 1 to the accounts on page 179, management concluded that demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient for the existing refineries to continue operating for the duration of their remaining useful lives and hence no changes to the useful economic lives of its refinery assets were required.\n- \u00b7 The total goodwill balance at 31 December 2021 is $12.4 billion, of which $7.6 billion relates to upstream oil and gas assets. The carrying values of goodwill may no longer be recoverable and therefore may need to be impaired. For oil production & operations (OP&O), goodwill is allocated to CGUs in aggregate at the segment level and for gas & low carbon energy (G&LCE) goodwill is allocated to the hydrocarbon CGUs within the segment. The most significant assumption in the goodwill impairment tests affected by climate change relates to future oil and gas prices (see 'Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets' below). Given the level of headroom in the goodwill impairment tests, which is significant for the OP&O segment, but more limited for G&LCE, management identified no other assumption that could lead to a material misstatement of goodwill due to the energy transition and other climate change factors. Disclosures in relation to sensitivities for goodwill are included within Note 13 on page 212. The C&P segment has a goodwill balance of $4.7 billion, of which the most significant element is $2.8 billion relating to the Lubricants business. Notwithstanding the expected global transition to electric vehicles which may reduce demand for Lubricants, due to the substantial headroom in the most recent impairment test (as described in Note 13), management has assessed as remote the likelihood that the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than its carrying value.\n- \u00b7 Climate change-related litigation brought against bp, as disclosed in Note 32 to the financial statements, may lead to an outflow of funds requiring provision in the current year.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n148",

        "page_content": "How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\nThe above considerations were a significant focus of management during the period which led to this being a matter that we communicated to the audit committee, and which had a significant effect on the overall audit strategy. We therefore identified this as a key audit matter.\n\n## Overall response\n\nWe held discussions with management, with Deloitte Climate Change specialists and within the group engagement team to identify the areas where we felt climate change could have a potential impact on the financial statements.\n\nWe also established a climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners with specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte to provide an independent challenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.\n\n## Audit procedures\n\nThe audit response related to two of the audit risks identified is set out under the key audit matters for 'Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets' on pages 151-153 and 'Decommissioning provisions' on pages 154-155. Other procedures are as follows:\n\nIn respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised at 31 December 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the group's E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes and tested management's key internal controls, including the controls that assess climate change related risks.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's key E&A judgements, with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6 and bp's accounting policy. We corroborated key internal and external evidence for assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management's key accounting judgement papers, holding discussions to challenge top level operational and finance management on the key judgements taken and reading external press releases, meeting minutes, licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or modify key terms.\n- \u00b7 When considering capital allocation decision making, we considered whether the progression of any projects that remain on the balance sheet would be inconsistent with elements of bp's strategy and in particular its net zero carbon commitments, bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 40% by 2030 relative to 2019), and the group's 'no exploration in new countries' commitment.\n\nWe challenged the results of the impairment testing of PP&E refining assets by considering internal and external market studies of future supply and demand and conducting sensitivity analysis. In relation to refinery impairment tests, we assessed the valuation methodology, tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment models and assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs. We also evaluated management's ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results to historical forecasts and tested management's internal controls over the impairment tests.\n\nWe challenged management's analysis that identified the specific assets that are likely to be disposed of by the group as part of its strategy. Where relevant, we challenged bp's asset impairment assessments based on their estimated disposal proceeds and whether transactions are judged likely to proceed or not. We obtained evidence of any negotiations with third parties and carefully considered the group's strategic intent in this context.\n\nWe challenged management's assertion that no changes are required to the assessed useful economic lives of refining assets as a consequence of climate change factors. In doing this, we obtained third party reports assessing future refined petroleum product demand for those countries which are included in our group full audit scope for the C&P segment. In particular, we considered the forecasts as set out in the IEA World Energy Outlook 2021 which shows that demand for refined petroleum products is expected to remain significant for at least the current remaining useful economic lives of the refineries, even under the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) consistent with the Paris 'well below 2\u00b0C goal'. In its definition of the SDS, the IEA states that with some level of net negative emissions after 2070, the temperature rise could be reduced to 1.5\u00b0C in 2100.\n\nWe performed procedures to satisfy ourselves that, other than future oil and gas price assumptions, there were no other assumptions in management's oil and gas goodwill impairment tests to which reasonably possible changes due to the energy transition and other climate change factors could cause goodwill to be materially misstated. We obtained evidence which supported management's conclusion that goodwill relating to the C&P segment activities is not impaired due to climate change or other factors.\n\nWith regard to climate change litigation, we designed procedures specifically to respond to the risks that provisions could be understated or that contingent liability disclosures may be omitted or be inaccurate including:\n\n- \u00b7 holding discussions with the executive vice president, legal and other senior bp lawyers regarding climate change matters\n- \u00b7 conducting a search for climate change litigation and claims brought against the group and\n- \u00b7 making written inquiries of, and holding discussions with, external legal counsel advising bp in relation to climate change litigation.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n149",

        "page_content": "## 5.2 Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets\n\nKey audit matter description\n\nThe group balance sheet at 31 December 2021 includes PP&E of $113 billion (2020 $115 billion), of which $74 billion (2020 $74 billion) is oil and gas properties within the OP&O ($47 billion) and G&LCE ($27 billion) segments.\n\nManagement's best estimate of oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised during 2021 as set out in Note 1 on page 178. The upward revisions to Brent oil assumptions up to 2030, and Henry Hub gas assumptions for 2022, compared to the prior year reflect expected near-term supply constraints. Brent oil assumptions post 2030 were revised downwards compared to the prior year, as bp expects an acceleration in the pace of transition to a low carbon economy. Aside from 2022, Henry Hub gas assumptions are unchanged from the prior year.\n\nGiven the significance of the price assumption revisions during 2021, alongside certain CGU specific new indicators, management tested most oil and gas CGUs for impairment and/or impairment reversal during the year. Management recorded $4.8 billion (2020 $0.1 billion) of pre-tax oil and gas CGU impairment reversals, in large part due to the oil and gas price upwards revisions detailed above, and $2.4 billion of pre-tax oil and gas CGU impairment charges (2020 $12.9 billion). Further information has been provided in Note 1 on page 184 and Note 3 on page 198.\n\nThrough our audit risk assessment procedures, we identified three key management estimates in management's determination of the level of impairment charge and/or reversal to record. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas prices - bp's oil and gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment assessments performed across the OP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the global energy transition and COVID-19. There is a risk that management do not forecast reasonable 'best estimate' oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for impairment and/or reversal, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions are highly judgmental and are pervasive inputs to bp's oil and gas CGU valuations, such that any misstatements would also aggregate. There is also a risk that management's oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.\n\nAside from 2022 where oil and gas prices reflect near-term expected market conditions, the group's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in use impairment assessments are aligned with bp's investment appraisal assumptions, except that potential future emissions costs that could be borne by bp are included in investment appraisals as bp costs without assuming incremental revenue.\n\nAs described in Note 1 on page 178, emissions costs forecasts interrelate with bp's oil and gas prices, because bp's price assumptions for value-in-use estimates represent 'net producer prices', i.e., net of any further emissions costs that may be enacted in the future. There is a risk management's judgement is not reasonable, that the potential impact of such further emissions costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on the group's oil and gas CGU carrying values as costs would effectively be borne by oil and gas end users via overall higher commodity prices.\n\n- \u00b7 Discount rates - Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management do not assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. Determining a reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate assumption is also a pervasive input across bp's oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset specific risks and tax rates, such that any misstatements would also aggregate.\n- \u00b7 Reserves and resources estimates - A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas production forecast, which is based on underlying reserves estimates and field specific development assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource volumes, in addition to proved and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions related to these volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise from unreasonable production forecasts for individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of systematic flaws in bp's reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and G&LCE segments.\n\nWe identified certain individual CGUs with a total carrying value of $33 billion (2020 $32 billion) which we determined would be most at risk of material impairment charges (and/or impairment reversals for CGUs with a combined $25 billion carrying value within this population) as a result of a plausible change in the oil and gas price assumptions. We identified that a subset of these CGUs were also individually materially sensitive to the discount rate assumption. Accordingly, we identified these as significant audit risks.\n\nWe also identified CGUs with a further $12 billion (2020 $16 billion) of combined carrying value which were less sensitive. We identified these as a higher audit risk as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a plausible change in some or all of the key assumptions. No impairment reversals are available for these CGUs. Further information regarding these sensitivities is given in Note 1 on page 186.\n\nImpairment and/or reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a key audit matter because recoverable values are reliant on forecasts that are inherently judgemental and complex for management to estimate, and the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk is material to the group.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n151",

        "page_content": "## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\nWe tested management's key internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates and reserve and resources estimates, as well as key internal controls over the performance of the impairment and/or reversal assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.\n\n## Oil and gas prices\n\n- \u00b7 We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management's oil and gas price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data.\n- \u00b7 In challenging management's price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change and the energy transition. The 2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement goals of 'Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels' was reaffirmed at COP 26 in Glasgow during November 2021. Nevertheless we understand that certain stakeholders are focussed increasingly on the 'no greater than 1.5\u00b0C' ambition element of the Paris Agreement.\n- \u00b7 We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris 'well below 2\u00b0C goal' and/or '1.5\u00b0C ambition' and considered whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's judgement, described in Note 1 on page 179, that the potential impact of further emission costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on the group's oil and gas CGU carrying values. We inquired of certain third party forecasters included in our reasonable range and reviewed their forecast price reports, to understand whether their oil and gas prices are forecast on a 'net producer prices' basis, (i.e. net of potential future emissions costs that are assumed to be borne by oil and gas end users), consistent with the basis of bp's value-in-use price assumptions.\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 3, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower oil and gas prices and how climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group's value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We independently evaluated bp's discount rates used in impairment tests with input from Deloitte valuation specialists, against relevant third party market and peer data.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp's discount rates.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 3 including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates\n\nWith the assistance of Deloitte oil and gas reserves specialists we:\n\n- \u00b7 assessed bp's reserves and resources estimation methods and policies\n- \u00b7 assessed, guided by our risk assessment, how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp's reserves and resources estimates which included those that we judged to represent the greatest risk of material misstatement\n- \u00b7 read a sample of reports provided by management's external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these third parties\n- \u00b7 assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of bp's internal and external reserves experts, through understanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience\n- \u00b7 compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management's approved reserves and resources estimates, those estimates having been subjected to the controls that we had tested and\n- \u00b7 performed a retrospective assessment to check for indications of estimation bias over time.\n\n## Other procedures\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and assessed management's CGU determinations, and considered whether there was any contradictory evidence present.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether bp's impairment methodology was acceptable under IFRS and tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of certain impairment models based on our risk assessment.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and assessed other CGU specific valuation input assumptions, including but not limited to material cost and tax forecasts, by comparing forecasts to approved internal and third party budgets, development plans, independent expectations and historical actuals.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether management's forecasts are consistent overall with bp's strategy, including the group's expectation to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 40% by 2030 relative to 2019). We observed they are not consistent in aggregate because bp expects to dispose of certain non-core assets in future periods (see 'Potential impact of climate change and the energy transition' above).\n- \u00b7 Where relevant, we assessed management's historical forecasting accuracy and whether the estimates had been determined and applied on a consistent basis across the group.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n152",

We determined that bp's 'best estimate' assumptions are reasonable when compared against  a range of third party forecasts and peer information that we identified as being appropriate for this purpose. In forming  this view, we included each forecaster's 'base case', 'central case' or 'most likely' estimate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                    | We further observed that, as well as publishing a 'base case', 'central case' or 'most likely' estimate, certain third party  price forecasters (including the IEA; and the WBCSD Catalogue pre-publication version as of January 2022) published  other price forecasts including some that were stated as, or were interpreted by us as being, Paris 'well below 2\u00b0C goal'  or Paris '1.5\u00b0C ambition' scenarios.

The estimation of decommissioning provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of  key estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, as well as inflation and discount rate. Given  management expects hydrocarbon production to be around 40% lower by 2030 relative to 2019 as stated on page 17,  consistency of that expectation with the timing of decommissioning expenditure and underlying cost assumptions  remains a key consideration.

We assessed the relevant internal and external evidence used in forming this judgement, including the financial health of the counterparty or counterparties in the ownership chain for the divested assets and the existence of any other pertinent factors which could indicate a higher probability of decommissioning obligations reverting to bp.\n\n## Potential decommissioning of refinery assets\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's analysis which supported their judgement that no decommissioning provisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no current intention to cease these activities. As referenced in the 'Potential impact of climate change and the energy transition' key audit matter in section 5.1 above, we considered internal and external demand forecasts. Furthermore, we read external profitability benchmarking which supported a conclusion that the company's remaining refineries would likely remain operational for longer than many of their regional competitors, in the event of refining capacity reductions. We also met with refinery management to understand the potential alternative use cases under consideration for refineries in the future, which include options for production of low carbon and sustainable fuels.\n\nWe concluded that that the cost and timing assumptions used in the decommissioning provision calculation were reasonable and the assumptions are appropriately supported by industry data. The disclosure included on page 191 with respect to the estimated undiscounted cost of bp's decommissioning obligations and the timing of future decommissioning payments are consistent with these conclusions.\n\nWe concluded that the assumed inflation rate of 1.5% remains reasonable as a long-term inflation rate for decommissioning liabilities. We accept as reasonable that the high level of general inflation experienced in 2021 does not require a change to bp's long term average inflation assumption. With respect to short term inflation, industry specific benchmarking remains supportive of the reasonableness of the provision cost estimates, with no significant 2021 inflation impact observed. bp's reduced 2.0% discount rate was within a reasonable range based on latest market data.\n\nNo material additional decommissioning provisions have been made in respect of historical divestments where bp are exposed to decommissioning reversion risk as a result of the future bankruptcy of the current asset owner. Based on our review and challenge of management's assessment, we consider this judgement to be reasonable. We also consider the contingent liability disclosure to be reasonable.\n\nIn respect of the group's refining assets, taking into consideration both the IEA 2021 demand forecasts and management's plans for the production of low carbon and sustainable fuels, we are satisfied that it is not currently possible for management to estimate reliably a settlement date for any decommissioning obligations prior to a decision being made to cease refining operations. Accordingly, we have not identified any triggers that would require a decommissioning provision to be recorded.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n155",

Amongst other things, to achieve bp's 'net-zero' ambition and to support the group strategy, T&S as a function is increasingly focused on executing long term renewable power offtake/supply contracts in existing and new markets whilst providing solutions to bp's customer through offering eco-friendly hydro-carbons. The nature of these transactions requires significant audit effort to be directed towards challenging management's adopted accounting treatment and/or valuation estimates.\n\nThroughout the year, we have kept our risk assessment updated by undertaking a review of portfolio composition. This process aided a deeper understanding of the impact of commodity price volatility, demand destruction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the changing structure of the markets, including the impact of the transition to renewables across all regions where bp operates, allowing us to focus our audit effort to areas of highest risk.\n\n## Accounting for structured commodity transactions (SCTs) :\n\nT&S may also enter into a variety of transactions which we refer to as SCTs. We generally consider a SCT to be an arrangement having one of the following features:\n\n- \u00b7 two or more counterparties with non-standard contractual terms\n- \u00b7 reference multiple commodity-based transactions and/or\n- \u00b7 contractual arrangements entered into in contemplation of each other.\n\nSCTs are often long-dated, can have a significant multi-year financial impact, and may require the use of complex valuation models or unobservable inputs when determining their fair value, in which case they will be classified as level 3 financial instruments under IFRS 13, 'Fair Value Measurement'.\n\nAccounting for SCTs is typically complex and initially involves significant judgment, as a feature of these transactions is that they often include multiple elements that will have a material impact on the presentation and disclosure in the financial statements and on key performance measures, including in particular the classification of liabilities as finance debt. Accordingly, we have identified a significant audit risk around the accounting for SCTs that have a quantitative impact of $300 million or higher on balances that affect group KPIs.\n\nAlthough we have reviewed several new SCTs entered into during the year, we have not identified any new types of SCT structures which we assess to be a significant risk.\n\n## Valuation of commodity financial derivatives:\n\nCommodity markets remained volatile during the year on the back of continuing demand uncertainty as a result of the pandemic and supply disruptions following geo-political tensions. In response to the volatility observed, we focused our audit efforts across valuation of all commodity derivatives and designed procedures to specifically test for management bias.\n\nUnlike other financial instruments whose values or inputs are readily observable and therefore more easily independently corroborated, there are certain transactions for which the valuation is inherently more subjective due to the use of either complex valuation models and/or unobservable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 3 financial assets or liabilities. This degree of subjectivity also gives rise to a risk of potential fraud through management incorporating bias in determining fair values. Accordingly, we have identified these as a significant audit risk.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the group's total financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value were $12.8 billion (2020 $12.7 billion) and $13.9 billion (2020 $8.4 billion), of which level 3 derivative financial assets were $5.5 billion (2020 $6.4 billion) and level 3 derivative financial liabilities were $3.9 billion (2020 $5.3 billion).\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n156",

We confirmed that any day one profits were appropriately deferred.\n- \u00b7 Selected a sample of existing working capital arrangements and financing structures to ensure that associated trading activity was in compliance with boundary conditions and the conclusions reached remained in compliance with relevant accounting standards.\n\nFor SCTs which were identified during the prior years and that continue through 2021, we have refreshed our assessment in 2021 taking account of any amendments to the contracts. We assessed the conclusions reached previously remain appropriate and in accordance with relevant accounting standards.\n\nTo assess the appropriateness of the accounting treatment of SCTs, we embedded technical accounting specialists within the audit team.\n\n## Valuation of commodity financial derivatives:\n\nIn response to the increased volatility observed in the market and to test for management bias, we altered the extent and timing of our procedures by performing an independent valuation of a sample of distinct Level 2 derivatives at 30 June, 30 September and 31 December, and on a sample of distinct Level 3 derivatives at 30 September and 31 December. In addition, we have focused our testing on price inputs where bp has substantial exposure to illiquid (Level 3) or long dated (Level 2) curves.\n\nTo address the complexities associated with auditing the value of level 3 financial instruments, the engagement team included valuation specialists having significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our audit procedures. Our valuation audit included the following control and substantive procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the group's valuation controls including the:\n- \u00b7 model certification control, which is designed to review a model's theoretical soundness and the appropriateness of its valuation methodology and\n- \u00b7 independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs that are not observable and are significant to the financial instrument's valuation.\n- \u00b7 We performed substantive valuation testing procedures at interim and year-end balance sheet dates, including:\n- \u00b7 comparing management's input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants and observable market data\n- \u00b7 evaluating management's valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a consistent framework is applied across the business period over period and\n- \u00b7 engaging a Deloitte valuations specialist to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and verify consistency in management's modelling and input assumptions throughout the year. Our independent estimates were established using independently sourced inputs (where available). We evaluated whether the differences between our independent estimates and management's estimates were within a reasonable range. In situations where we utilised management's inputs, these were compared to external data sources to determine whether they were reasonable.\n\nWe assessed the features of the SCTs and determined that the accounting adopted for each of them was appropriate and in accordance with IFRS.\n\nWe concluded that management's valuations relating to commodity derivatives were appropriate.\n\nWe did not identify any indications of inappropriate misrepresentation of revenue recognition in the transactions, valuation estimates or accounting entries that we tested.\n\nWe did not identify any issues in our testing of the controls related to the accounting for complex transactions and found these to be operating effectively.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n157",

In addition, we: Made inquiries of individuals involved in the financial  reporting process about inappropriate or unusual activity relating to the processing of journal entries and other  adjustments. Identified and tested relevant entity-level controls, in particular those related to the bp Code of Conduct,  whistleblowing (bp OpenTalk) and controls monitoring financial reporting processes and financial results. Used our data  analytics tools to select for testing journal entries and other adjustments made at the end of a reporting period or  otherwise having characteristics associated with common fraud schemes. Tested journal entries and other adjustments  recorded in the general ledger throughout the period, with a particular focus on adjustments that occur late in the  financial close process. We assessed accounting estimates for bias and evaluated whether the circumstances  producing the bias, if any, represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. A number of the most significant  estimates are covered by the other Key Audit Matters set out above. This assessment included: evaluating whether the  judgements and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included in the financial  statements, even if they are individually reasonable, indicate a possible bias on the part of bp's management that may  represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud and performing a retrospective analysis of management  judgements and assumptions related to significant accounting estimates reflected in the financial statements of the  prior year.

We evaluated the design  of the controls implemented in 2021 to remediate the deficiencies and will test the operating effectiveness of these as  part of our 2022 audit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n159",

Our application of materiality\n\n## 6.1 Materiality\n\nWe define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\nGroup financial statements\n\n## Parent company financial statements\n\n| Materiality                          | Materiality has been set at $700 million for the current year.

Accordingly, we changed our chosen metric  from net assets in 2020 to profit before tax and underlying  replacement cost profit before interest and tax in 2021.  Materiality was determined to be $700 million, which is  4.6% of profit before tax, 3.1% of underlying replacement  cost profit before tax and 0.77% of net assets. In 2020, we determined materiality to be $600 million,  0.73% of net assets. | We determined materiality for our audit of the standalone  parent using 1% (2020 1%) of net assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Rationale for the  benchmark applied | We conducted an assessment of which line items are the  most important to investors and analysts by reading analyst  reports and bp's communications to shareholders and  lenders, as well as the communications of peer companies. Profit before tax is the benchmark ordinarily considered by  us when auditing listed entities. It provides comparability  against companies across all sectors but has limitations  when auditing companies whose earnings are strongly  correlated to commodity prices, which can be volatile from  one period to the next, and therefore may not be  representative of the volume of transactions and the overall  size of the business in the year.                                       | The materiality determined for the standalone parent  company financial statements exceeds the group  materiality. This is due to the fact that the net asset balance  of the parent company financial statements exceeds the net  asset balance of the group financial statements. As the  company is nontrading and operates primarily as a holding  company, we believe the net asset position is the most  appropriate benchmark to use. Where there were balances and transactions within the  parent company accounts that were within the scope of the  audit of the group financial statements, our procedures  were undertaken using the lower materiality level applicable |\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n160",

An overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## 7.1 Identification and scoping of components\n\nAs a result of the highly disaggregated nature of the group, with operations in over 70 countries through approximately 850 cons units, a significant portion of our audit planning effort was ensuring that the scope of our work is appropriate in addressing the identified risks of material misstatement.\n\nThe factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the bp audit, and the level of work to be performed at the cons units that are in scope for group reporting purposes, included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The financial significance of an operating unit (which will typically include multiple cons units) to bp's revenue and profit before tax, or PP&E, including consideration of the financial significance of specific account balances or transactions.\n- \u00b7 The significance of specific risks relating to an operating unit, history of unusual or complex transactions, identification of significant audit issues or the potential for, or a history of, material misstatements.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n161",

There are additional cons units in respect of the Lubricants business which have been scoped in during the current year to ensure an appropriate audit coverage of revenue, following the change in accounting policy in respect of the integrated books in the T&S function. Certain cons units have fallen out of scope due to disposals, asset impairments and non-recurring one off transactions which were in scope in the prior year. Our full-scope audits are in the UK, US, Australia, Azerbaijan, Germany and Singapore. One of the full-scope cons units includes the investment in Rosneft, a material associate not controlled by bp.\n\nIn addition, component teams performed audit procedures on specified account balances in 32 cons units (2020 62) also covering Angola, Alaska, Trinidad & Tobago, Mauritania & Senegal, and Canada. The group engagement team performed audit procedures on specified account balances to component materiality, with certain additional specific procedures performed by component teams, covering an additional 20 cons units (2020 42).\n\nThe remaining cons units are not significant individually and include many small, low risk components and balances. On average, they each represent 0.04% of group revenue (2020 0.03%), 0.03% of property, plant and equipment (2020 0.03%) and 0.03% of profit before tax (2020 0.03%).\n\nIn our assessment of the residual balances not covered by the above procedures, we have considered in particular the risk that there could be a material misstatement within the large number of geographically dispersed businesses, in particular within the C&P segment. This assessment included use of our analytic tools to interrogate data, preparation of trend analysis and comparison of business performance to market benchmark prices. We also tested management's group-wide controls across a range of locations and segments. We concluded that through this additional risk assessment, we have reduced the audit risk of such a misstatement arising to a sufficiently low level.\n\nOur audit coverage of 'Property, plant and equipment' and 'Sales and other operating revenue' is materially the same as in the prior year. This year we have also included the 'Profit before tax' audit coverage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull audit scope\n\nSpecified account balances\n\nSpecified audit procedures\n\nReview at group level\n\n## 7.2 Our consideration of the control environment\n\nOur audit approach was generally to place reliance on management's relevant controls over all business cycles affecting in scope financial statement line items. As part of our controls testing, we assessed the design and implementation of controls and tested a sample for operating effectiveness through a combination of tests of inquiry, observation, inspection and re-performance.\n\nIn limited situations where we were not able to take a controls reliance approach due to controls being deficient and there not being sufficient mitigating or alternative controls we could rely on instead, we adopted a non-controls reliance approach. All control deficiencies which we considered to be significant, were communicated to the audit committee. All other deficiencies were communicated to management. For all deficiencies identified we considered the impact and updated our audit plan accordingly.\n\nThe group's financial systems environment is complex, with 116 separate IT systems scoped as being relevant to the audit for the following key locations (UK, US, Germany, Angola, Azerbaijan and Australia) as well as other minor locations. These systems are all directly or indirectly relevant to the entity's financial reporting process.\n\nWe planned to rely on the General IT Controls (GITCs) associated with these systems, where the GITCs were appropriately designed and implemented, and these were operating effectively. To assess the operating effectiveness of GITCs we performed testing on access security, change management, data centre operations and network operations. We have included our observations on the IT controls in our key audit matter section, (see 'IT controls relating to financial systems' above).\n\n## 7.3  Working with other auditors\n\nThe group audit team are responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and provide direct oversight, review, and coordination of our component audit teams. We interacted regularly with the component Deloitte teams during each stage of the audit and reviewed key working papers.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n162\n\nProfit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull audit scope\n\nSpecified account balances\n\nSpecified audit procedures\n\nReview at group level\n\nProperty, plant & equipment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull audit scope\n\nSpecified account balances\n\nSpecified audit procedures\n\nReview at group level",

As a result of this, we performed alternative virtual procedures which included attending planning meetings, discussing the audit approach and any issues arising from the component team's work, virtual meetings with local management, and reviewing key audit working papers on higher and significant-risk areas to drive a consistent and high-quality audit. In addition, a global audit planning meeting was held virtually for three days in June and July 2021 led by the senior statutory auditor and involving the group audit team, partners and staff from all full scope component teams, audit teams responsible for testing at key GBS locations, senior management from bp and the audit committee chairman.\n\nWe were provided with direct access to Rosneft's auditor in order to evaluate their audit work on the financial statements of Rosneft, used as the basis for bp's equity accounting. We held meetings with Rosneft's auditor throughout the year, issued audit instructions to them, reviewed their written clearance reports responding to these instructions and, through our direct access, were able to exercise appropriate supervision and oversight of their audit work. We also tested directly bp's procedures and controls over its accounting for the investment in Rosneft.\n\n## 8. Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\n## 9. Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 10. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## 11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\n## 11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\n\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Ethics and Compliance and reviews of bp's internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations\n- \u00b7 enquiries of management, internal audit, and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the group's policies and procedures relating to:\n- \u00b7 identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance\n- \u00b7 detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud and\n- \u00b7 the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n- \u00b7 the group's remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels and\n- \u00b7 discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with companies in the same sectors as bp operates, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved fraud specialists who advised the engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries and they participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n163\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of these matters.",

        "page_content": "In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\n\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, UK Corporate Governance Code, IFRS as issued by the IASB, United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards, FRS 101, US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and relevant SEC regulations, as well as laws and regulations prevailing in each country in which we identified a full-scope component.\n\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group's operating licences and environmental regulations.\n\n## 11.2 Audit response to risks identified\n\nAs a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We did identify two key audit matters relating to fraud risks, as described above, being the accounting for SCTs and Level 3 instruments within T&S, and management override of controls. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.\n\nIn addition to the above, procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements\n- \u00b7 enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims\n- \u00b7 obtained confirmations from external legal counsel concerning open litigation and claims\n- \u00b7 performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud and\n- \u00b7 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC and the IRS.\n\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## 12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 The information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 The strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\n## 13. Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 143\n- \u00b7 the directors' explanation as to its assessment of the group's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 143\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 143\n- \u00b7 the board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 73\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 142 and\n- \u00b7 the section describing the work of the audit committee set out on pages 107-113.\n\n164\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as at 31 December 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2021,in conformity with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021, based on criteria established in the UK Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting and our report dated 18 March 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Change in accounting principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its accounting policy related to the presentation of revenues and purchases relating to physically settled derivative contracts.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the group's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the group's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## 1. Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets - Notes 1, 3 and 11 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe group balance sheet at 31 December 2021 includes PP&E of $113 billion, of which $74 billion is oil and gas properties within the OP&O ($47 billion) and G&LCE ($32 billion) segments.\n\nManagement's 'best estimate' of oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised during 2021 as set out in Note 1 on page 178. The upward revisions to Brent oil assumptions up to 2030, and Henry Hub gas assumptions for 2022, compared to the prior year reflect expected near-term supply constraints. Brent oil assumptions post 2030 were revised downwards compared to the prior year, as bp expects an acceleration in the pace of transition to a low carbon economy. Aside from 2022, Henry Hub gas assumptions are unchanged from the prior year.\n\nGiven the significance of the price assumption revisions during 2021, alongside certain CGU specific new indicators, management tested most oil and gas CGUs for impairment and/or impairment reversal during the year. Management recorded $4.8 billion of pre-tax oil and gas CGU impairment reversals, in large part due to the oil and gas price upwards revisions detailed above, and $2.4 billion of pre-tax oil and gas CGU impairment charges. Further information has been provided in Note 1 on page 184 and Note 3 on page 198.\n\nWe identified three key management estimates in management's determination of the level of impairment charge and/or reversal to record. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas prices - bp's oil and gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment assessments performed across the OP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the global energy transition and COVID-19. There is a risk that management do not forecast reasonable 'best estimate' oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for impairment and/or reversal, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions are highly judgmental and are pervasive inputs to bp's oil and gas CGU valuations, such that any misstatements would also aggregate. There is also a risk that management's oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.\n- The group's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in use impairment assessments are aligned with bp's investment appraisal assumptions, except that potential future emissions costs that could be borne by bp are included in investment appraisals as bp costs without assuming incremental revenue.\n\nAs described in Note 1 on page 178, emissions costs forecasts interrelate with bp's oil and gas prices, because bp's price assumptions for valuein-use estimates represent 'net producer prices', i.e., net of any further emissions costs that may be enacted in the future. There is a risk management's judgement is not reasonable, that the potential impact of such further emissions costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on the group's oil and gas CGU carrying values as costs would effectively be borne by oil and gas end users via overall higher commodity prices.\n\n166\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements Financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 Discount rates - Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management do not assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. Determining a reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate assumption is also a pervasive input across bp's oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset specific risks and tax rates, such that any misstatements would also aggregate.\n- \u00b7 Reserves and resources estimates - A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas production forecast, which is based on underlying reserves estimates and field specific development assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource volumes, in addition to proved and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions related to these volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise from unreasonable production forecasts for individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of systematic flaws in bp's reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and G&LCE segments.\n\nWe identified certain individual CGUs with a total carrying value of $33 billion which we determined would be most at risk of material impairment charges (and/or impairment reversals for CGUs with a combined $25 billion carrying value within this population) as a result of a plausible change in the oil and gas price assumptions. We identified that a subset of these CGUs were also individually materially sensitive to the discount rate assumption.\n\nWe also identified CGUs with a further $12 billion of combined carrying value which were less sensitive as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a plausible change in some or all of the key assumptions. No impairment reversals are available for these CGUs. Further information regarding these sensitivities is given in Note 1 on page 186.\n\nImpairment and/or reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a critical audit matter because recoverable values are reliant on forecasts that are inherently judgemental and complex for management to estimate, and the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk is material to the group.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nWe tested management's key internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates and reserve and resources estimates, as well as key internal controls over the performance of the impairment and/or reversal assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.\n\n## Oil and gas prices\n\n- \u00b7 We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management's oil and gas price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data.\n- \u00b7 In challenging management's price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change and the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 The 2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement goals of 'Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels' was reaffirmed at COP 26 in Glasgow during November 2021. Nevertheless, we understand that certain stakeholders are focussed increasingly on the 'no greater than 1.5\u00b0C' ambition element of the Paris Agreement.\n- \u00b7 We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated as being, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris 'well below 2\u00b0C goal' and/or '1.5\u00b0C ambition' and considered whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's judgement, described in Note 1 on page 179, that the potential impact of further emission costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on the group's oil and gas CGU carrying values. We inquired of certain third party forecasters included in our reasonable range and reviewed their forecast price reports, to understand whether their oil and gas prices are forecast on a 'net producer prices' basis, (i.e. net of potential future emissions costs that are assumed to be borne by oil and gas end users), consistent with the basis of bp's value-in-use price assumptions.\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 3, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower oil and gas prices and how climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group's value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We independently evaluated bp's discount rates used in impairment tests with input from Deloitte valuation specialists, against relevant third party market and peer data.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp's discount rates.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 3 including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates\n\nWith the assistance of Deloitte oil and gas reserves specialists we:\n\n- \u00b7 assessed bp's reserves and resources estimation methods and policies\n- \u00b7 assessed, guided by our risk assessment, how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp's reserves and resources estimates which included those that we judged to represent the greatest risk of material misstatement\n- \u00b7 read a sample of reports provided by management's external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these third parties\n- \u00b7 assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of bp's internal and external reserve experts; through understanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience\n- \u00b7 compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management's approved reserves and resources estimates, those estimates having been subjected to the controls that we had tested and\n- \u00b7 performed a retrospective assessment to check for indications of estimation bias over time.\n\n## Other procedures\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and assessed management's CGU determinations, and considered whether there was any contradictory evidence present.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n167",

We assessed whether management's forecasts are consistent overall with bp's strategy, including the group's expectation to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 40% by 2030 relative to 2019).\n- \u00b7 Where relevant, we assessed management's historical forecasting accuracy and whether the estimates had been determined and applied on a consistent basis across the group.\n\n## 2. Decommissioning provisions - Notes 1 and 22\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nA decommissioning provision of $16.4 billion has been recognised in the financial statements at 31 December 2021. The estimation of decommissioning provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, as well as inflation and discount rate. Given management expects hydrocarbon production to be around 40% lower by 2030 relative to 2019 as stated on page 17, consistency of that expectation with the timing of decommissioning expenditure and underlying cost assumptions is a key consideration. The estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of future payment are set out in Note 1 on page 191.\n\nEconomic factors, future activities and the legislative environments that bp operates in are used to inform cost estimates, whereas the timing of decommissioning activities is dependent on cessation of production (CoP) dates, which are sensitive to changes in bp's price forecasts as price estimates determine economic cut off of oil and gas reserve estimates.\n\nThe inflation rate used in bp's decommissioning provision calculations has remained unchanged during 2021 at 1.5%. The impact of inflation on the forecast cost assumptions is an area of specific focus given the significant and sustained inflationary increases experienced globally since early 2021. In the second quarter of 2021 bp reduced its discount rate used for calculating its decommissioning provisions from 2.5% to 2.0% due to ongoing challenging macroeconomic conditions decreasing US treasury bond rates.\n\nAdditionally, bp is potentially exposed to decommissioning obligations that could revert back to bp in respect of historical divestments to third parties. Judgement is required to assess the potential risk of reversion and if applicable, the estimated exposure, for each historically divested asset. The risk of possible exposure was enhanced due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, which have heightened liquidity and financial resilience concerns for many industry participants. The risk has further increased following a US legal judgement in the year which required a specific provision and increased the likelihood of decommissioning liabilities reverting to former owners as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nProvisions for decommissioning refining assets, previously not generally recognised on the basis that the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions in demand due to climate change curtail their operational lives. As disclosed in Note 1 on page 191 management concluded that, although obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations, they would only be recognised at the point when sufficient information became available to determine potential settlement dates. Management has conducted analysis which supports a conclusion that demand for refined products is expected to remain strong in areas served by its existing refineries Accordingly, other than where a decision has been made to cease refining operations, no triggers for assessing the need to record a decommissioning provision have been identified.\n\nWe determined this to be a critical audit matter given the high degree of auditor judgment and the increased extent of effort by senior members of the engagement team.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the group's decommissioning estimate and provisioning process and evaluated the effectiveness of the relevant controls.\n\n## Cost and timing estimates\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the assets subject to decommissioning, including understanding the process to establish whether a legal or constructive obligation existed.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated changes in key cost assumptions including rig rates, vessel rates, well plug and abandonment duration and non-productive time assumptions. We also assessed the reasonableness of key cost assumptions with reference to internal and appropriate third party data.\n- \u00b7 We considered the expectation that demand for oil and gas products and related activities will decrease, primarily in response to climate change and energy transition effects pivoting future energy industry investment and development activity towards renewable sources. We challenged management's assessment of the impact this will have on the decommissioning provisions.\n- \u00b7 We assessed changes in assumptions for the estimated date of decommissioning and evaluated whether CoP dates used for decommissioning estimation are aligned with CoP assumptions in other areas, including PP&E impairment testing and oil and gas reserve estimation.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the accuracy of bp's additional disclosure of the estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of future decommissioning payments.\n\n## Inflation and discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 With the help of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the discount and inflation rate assumptions used, comparing them against latest external market data.\n- \u00b7 We challenged how management has considered the current high level of inflation in setting 2021 decommissioning cost assumptions.\n- \u00b7 We tested the decommissioning models, assessing the application of cost, timing, inflation and discount rate assumptions when calculating the final provisions.\n\n## Reversion risk\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the group's decommissioning reversion risk assessment process, noting that the process was enhanced during\n- 2021 in direct response to the increased potential default risk in respect of historical divestments to third parties.\n- \u00b7 We tested management's key internal controls within this enhanced process, including those controls over the completeness and accuracy of the previously divested asset data.\n\n168\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

We assessed the relevant internal and external evidence used in forming this judgement, including the financial health of the counterparty or counterparties in the ownership chain for the divested assets and the existence of any other pertinent factors which could indicate a higher probability of decommissioning obligations reverting to bp.\n\n## Potential decommissioning of refinery assets\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's analysis which supported their judgement that no decommissioning provisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no current intention to cease these activities. In making this evaluation, we considered internal and external demand forecasts and assessed external profitability benchmarking.\n- \u00b7 We also met with refinery management to understand the potential alternative use cases under consideration for refineries in the future, which include options for the production of low carbon and sustainable fuels.\n- 3. Accounting for complex transactions executed by the trading and shipping (T&S) function to deliver against the wider group strategy and valuation of commodity financial derivatives, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition (potentially impacting all financial statement accounts, in particular finance debt) - Notes 1, 19, 21, 28 and 29 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nIn the normal course of business, T&S enters into a variety of transactions for delivering value across the group's supply chain. Amongst other things, to achieve bp's 'net zero' ambition and to support the group strategy, T&S as a function is increasingly focused on executing long term renewable power offtake/supply contracts in existing and new markets whilst providing solutions to bp's customer through offering eco-friendly hydro-carbons. The nature of these transactions requires significant audit effort to be directed towards challenging management's adopted accounting treatment and/ or valuation estimates.\n\nThroughout the year, we have kept our risk assessment updated by undertaking a review of portfolio composition. This process aided a deeper understanding of the impact of commodity price volatility, demand destruction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the changing structure of the markets, including the impact of the transition to renewables across all regions where bp operates, allowing us to focus our audit effort to areas of highest risk.\n\n## Accounting for structured commodity transactions (SCTs):\n\nT&S may also enter into a variety of transactions which we refer to as structured commodity transactions (SCTs). We generally consider a SCT to be an arrangement having one of the following features:\n\n- \u00b7 two or more counterparties with non-standard contractual terms\n- \u00b7 reference multiple commodity-based transactions and/or\n- \u00b7 contractual arrangements entered into in contemplation of each other.\n\nSCTs are often long-dated, can have a significant multi-year financial impact, and may require the use of complex valuation models or unobservable inputs when determining their fair value, in which case they will be classified as level 3 financial instruments under IFRS 13, 'Fair Value Measurement'.\n\nAccounting for SCTs is typically complex and involves significant judgment, as a feature of these transactions is that they often include multiple elements that will have a material impact on the presentation and disclosure in the financial statements, including in particular the classification of liabilities as finance debt.\n\n## Valuation of commodity financial derivatives:\n\nCommodity markets remained volatile during the year on the back of continuing demand uncertainty as a result of the pandemic and supply disruptions following geo-political tensions. In response to the volatility observed, we focused our audit efforts across valuation of all commodity derivatives and designed procedures to specifically test for management bias.\n\nUnlike other financial instruments whose values or inputs are readily observable and therefore more easily independently corroborated, there are certain transactions for which the valuation is inherently more subjective due to the use of either complex valuation models and/or unobservable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 3 financial assets or liabilities. This degree of subjectivity also gives rise to a risk of potential fraud through management incorporating bias in determining fair values.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the group's total financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value were $12.8 billion and $13.9 billion, of which level 3 derivative financial assets were $5.5 billion and level 3 derivative financial liabilities were $3.9 billion.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\n## Accounting for structured commodity transactions:\n\nFor structured commodity transactions, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested controls related to the accounting for complex transactions.\n- \u00b7 Developed an understanding of the commercial rationale of the transactions through discussions with management and reading transaction documents and executed agreements.\n- \u00b7 Performed a detailed accounting analysis for a sample of SCTs involving significant day one profits, offtake arrangements and/or significant contractual commitments. We confirmed that any day one profits were appropriately deferred.\n- \u00b7 Selected a sample of existing working capital arrangements and financing structures to assess whether associated trading activity was in compliance with boundary conditions and whether the conclusions reached remained in compliance with relevant accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 For SCTs which were identified during the prior years and that continue through 2021, we have refreshed our assessment in 2021 taking account of any amendments to the contracts. We assessed whether the conclusions reached previously remain appropriate and in accordance with relevant accounting standards.\n\nTo assess the appropriateness of the accounting treatment of SCTs, we embedded technical accounting specialists within the audit team.\n\n## Valuation of commodity financial derivatives:\n\nIn response to the increased volatility observed in the market and to test for management bias, we altered the extent and timing of our procedures by performing an independent valuation of a sample of distinct Level 2 derivatives at 30 June, 30 September and 31 December, and on a sample of\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n169",

In addition, we have focused our testing on price inputs where bp has substantial exposure to illiquid (Level 3) or long dated (Level 2) curves.\n\nTo address the complexities associated with auditing the value of level 3 financial instruments, the engagement team included valuation specialists having significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our audit procedures. Our valuation audit included the following control and substantive procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the group's valuation controls including the:\n- - model certification control, which is designed to review a model's theoretical soundness and the appropriateness of its valuation methodology and\n- - independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs that are not observable and are significant to the financial instrument's valuation.\n- \u00b7 We performed substantive valuation testing procedures at interim and year-end balance sheet dates, including:\n- - comparing management's input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants and observable market data\n- - evaluating management's valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a consistent framework is applied across the business period over period and\n- - engaging a Deloitte valuations specialist to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and verify consistency in management's modelling and input assumptions throughout the year. Our independent estimates were established using independently sourced inputs (where available). We evaluated whether the differences between our independent estimates and management's estimates were within a reasonable range. In situations where we utilised management's inputs, these were compared to external data sources to determine whether they were reasonable.\n\n## 4. Impairment of E&A assets and refinery PP&E as a consequence, inter alia, of climate change and the energy transition - Notes 1, 3 and 14\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nThe recoverability of certain of the group's $4.3 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised at 31 December 2021 are inherently judgemental and are potentially exposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors (see Note 14). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed as a consequence of lower forecast future oil and gas prices and bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production. The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be written off, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex, continues to require significant management judgement for certain E&A projects.\n\n## PP&E\n\nThe recoverability of certain of the group's $18.1 billion PP&E refining assets capitalised at 31 December 2021 are judgmental due to forecasting of cash flows and other key inputs of such assets which are impacted by the changes in supply and demand which arise as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition. Impairment tests were performed to assess the recoverability of each refinery's carrying values. As disclosed in Note 3 to the accounts on page 200, management has recorded impairment charges of $962 million in the C&P segment, which primarily related to their refining assets.\n\nbp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 40% by 2030 relative to 2019) and the group's wider strategy includes potentially disposing of certain high emissions intensity upstream oil assets and others. As a consequence for certain assets judgement is required in the determination of the recoverable amount as to whether it should consider the estimated disposal proceeds from a third party as a key input. Management recorded $1.1 billion of pre-tax impairment charges in 2021 for such potential disposals as described in Note 3. There is an audit risk that management judgements taken to determine whether impairment charges are required based on bp's view of whether transactions are likely to proceed or not, and bp's strategic appetite regarding the value of disposal consideration that would be accepted, are not reasonable.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nWe established a climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners with specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte to provide an independent challenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.\n\n## Audit procedures\n\nIn respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised at 31 December 2021 we:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtained an understanding of the group's E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes and tested management's key internal controls, including the controls that assess climate change related risks.\n- \u00b7 Challenged and evaluated management's key E&A judgements, with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6 and bp's accounting policy. We corroborated key internal and external evidence for assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management's key accounting judgement papers, holding discussions to challenge top level operational and finance management on the key judgements taken and reading external press releases, meeting minutes, licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or modify key terms.\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the progression of any projects that remain on the balance sheet would be inconsistent with elements of bp's strategy and in particular its net zero carbon commitments, bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 40% by 2030 relative to 2019), and the group's 'no exploration in new countries' commitment.\n\nIn respect of the recoverability of PP&E refining assets capitalised at 31 December 2021 we:\n\n- \u00b7 tested management's internal controls over the impairment evaluation\n- \u00b7 assessed the valuation methodology, discount rate, including testing of source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation\n- \u00b7 evaluated management's ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results to historical forecasts\n- \u00b7 evaluated the cash flows and other key inputs of the impairment testing of PP&E refining assets by considering internal and external market studies of future supply and demand and conducting sensitivity analysis and\n- \u00b7 assessed the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment models and assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs.\n\n170\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021, based on the criteria established in the UK FRC Guidance.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021, of the Company and our report dated 18 March 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's change in accounting principle.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\n\nLondon, United Kingdom 18 March 2022\n\n172\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\n## Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as bp or the group) for the year ended 31 December 2021 were approved and signed by the chief executive officer and chairman on 18 March 2022 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. BP p.l.c. is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), IFRS as adopted in the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under international accounting standards. As a result of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, with effect from 1 January 2021, the consolidated financial statements are also prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the UK. IFRS as adopted by the UK does not differ from IFRS as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the UK and EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. The differences have no impact on the group's consolidated financial statements for the years presented. The UK's withdrawal from the EU has not had a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies and accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions of the group are set out below.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 December 2021. The accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all years presented, except where otherwise indicated.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## Significant accounting policies: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nInherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements is the need for bp management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes on financial statements.\n\nThe areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are: accounting for the investments in Rosneft and Aker BP; exploration and appraisal intangible assets; the recoverability of asset carrying values, including the estimation of reserves; supplier financing arrangements; derivative financial instruments; provisions and contingencies; and pensions and other post-retirement benefits. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the consolidated financial statements are also set out in boxed text below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These may have significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the group's assets and liabilities discussed below and on similar assets and liabilities that may be recognized in the future. The group's assumptions for investment appraisal (see page 32) form part of an investment decision-making framework for currently unsanctioned future capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment, and intangibles including exploration and appraisal assets, that is designed to support the effective and resilient implementation of bp's strategy. The price assumptions used for investment appraisal include oil and gas price assumptions, which are producer prices and are therefore net of any future carbon prices that the purchaser may be required to pay, and an assumption of a single carbon emissions cost imposed on the producer in respect of operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and methane) in order to incentivize engineering solutions to mitigate GHG emissions on projects. The group's oil, gas and carbon price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing are aligned with those investment appraisal assumptions, except for, 2022 oil and gas prices which reflect near-term market conditions, and the assumptions for future carbon emissions costs described below.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill\n\nThe energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management's best estimate of oil price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing was revised during 2021. The assumption up to 2030 was increased to reflect near-term supply constraints whereas the long-term assumption was decreased as bp's management expects an acceleration of the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy. Henry Hub gas price assumptions remain unchanged from 2020 except that the assumption for 2022 has been increased to reflect short-term market conditions. The revised assumptions sit within the range of external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nAs noted above, the group's investment appraisal process includes a single carbon emissions price assumption for the investment economics which is applied to bp's anticipated share of bp's forecast of the investments assets' scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions where they exceed defined thresholds, and is assumed to be payable by bp as the producer or as a non-operator. However, for value-in-use impairment testing on bp's existing cash generating units (CGUs), consistent with all other relevant cash flows estimated, bp is required to reflect management's best estimate of any expected applicable carbon emission costs payable by bp, including where bp in not the operator, in the future for each jurisdiction in which the group has interests. This requires management's best estimate of how future changes to relevant carbon emission cost policies and/or legislation are likely to affect the future cash flows of the group's applicable CGUs, whether currently enacted or not. Future potential carbon pricing and/or costs of carbon emissions allowances are included in the value-in-use calculations to the extent management has sufficient information to make such an estimate. Currently this results in limited application of carbon price assumptions in value-in-use impairment tests given that carbon pricing legislation in most jurisdictions where the group has interests is not in place and there is not sufficient information available as to the relevant policy makers' future intentions regarding carbon pricing to support an estimate.\n\n178\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nHowever, as bp's forecast future prices are producer prices, the group considers it reasonable to assume that if, in addition to the costs already in place, further scope 1 and 2 emission costs were partially to be borne directly by oil and gas producers including bp in future and the prevalence of such costs were to become widespread, the gross oil and gas prices realised by producers would be correspondingly higher over the long term, resulting in no expected overall materially negative impacts on the group's net cash flows. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values for further information including sensitivity analysis in relation to reasonably possible changes in the price assumptions and carbon costs.\n\nProduction assumptions within upstream property, plant and equipment, and goodwill value-in-use impairment tests reflect management's current best estimate of future production of the existing upstream portfolio. The group's sees the expected reduction in upstream hydrocarbon production by around 40% by 2030 from its 2019 baseline (see page 17) being achieved through future active management and high-grading of the portfolio. Changes in upstream production since 2019 will be included in the best estimate however as the specific future changes to the portfolio are not yet known, the current best estimate does not include the full extent of the expected upstream production reduction. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and Note 13 for sensitivity analyses in relation to reasonably possible changes in production for upstream oil and gas properties and goodwill respectively.\n\nImpairment reversals were recognized on certain upstream oil and gas properties partly as a result of the higher near-term assumptions. See Note 3 for further information.\n\nFor the customers & products segment, though the energy transition may impact demand for certain refined products in the future, management anticipates sufficiently robust demand for the remainder of each refinery's useful life.\n\nManagement will continue to review price assumptions as the energy transition progresses and this may result in impairment charges or reversals in the future.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal intangible assets\n\nThe energy transition may affect the future development or viability of exploration prospects. A significant proportion of exploration and appraisal intangible assets were written off in 2020 as a result of lower price assumptions and work to develop bp's new strategy. The recoverability of the remaining intangibles was considered during 2021 and no significant write-offs were identified. These assets will continue to be assessed as the energy transition progresses . See significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets and Note 7 for further information.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment - depreciation and expected useful lives\n\nThe energy transition may curtail the expected useful lives of oil and gas industry assets thereby accelerating depreciation charges. However, the significant majority of bp's existing upstream oil and natural gas properties are likely to be fully depreciated within the next 10 years and, as outlined in bp's strategy, oil and natural gas production will remain an important part of bp's business activities over that period. Similarly, for refineries, demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient to support the remaining useful life of existing assets. Therefore, management does not expect the useful lives of bp's reported property, plant and equipment to change and do not consider this to be a significant accounting judgement or estimate. Significant capital expenditure is still required for ongoing projects and therefore the useful lives of future capital expenditure may be different. See significant accounting policy: property, plant and equipment for more information.\n\n## Provisions: decommissioning\n\nThe energy transition may bring forward the decommissioning of oil and gas industry assets thereby increasing the present value of associated decommissioning provisions. The majority of bp's existing upstream oil and gas properties are expected to start decommissioning within the next two decades. The group's expectation to reduce its upstream hydrocarbon production by around 40% by 2030 from its 2019 baseline (see page 17) is expected to be achieved through future active management and high-grading of the portfolio. Any resulting increases or decreases to the weighted average timing of decommissioning will be driven by the profile of assets held in the revised portfolio. Currently, the expected timing of decommissioning expenditures for the upstream oil and gas assets in the group's portfolio has not materially been brought forward. Management does not expect any reasonable change in the expected timing of decommissioning to have a material effect on the upstream decommissioning provisions, assuming cash flows remain unchanged.\n\nDecommissioning cost estimates are based on the known regulatory and external environment. These cost estimates may change in the future, including as a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy. For refineries, decommissioning provisions are generally not recognized as the associated obligations have indeterminate settlement dates, typically driven by the cessation of manufacturing. Management will continue to review facts and circumstances to assess if decommissioning provisions need to be recognized. See significant judgements and estimates: provisions for further information.\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic environment\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic environment.\n\n## Going concern\n\nForecast liquidity has been assessed under a number of stressed scenarios, including a significant decline in oil prices over the 12-month period. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements even if the Brent price fell to zero. No material uncertainties over going concern or significant judgements or estimates in the assessment were identified. See also Note 28 Financial instruments and financial risk factors - Liquidity risk for further information.\n\n## Discount rate assumptions\n\nThe discount rates used for impairment testing and provisions were reassessed during the year in light of changing economic and geopolitical outlooks. The nominal discount rate applied to provisions was reduced during the year to reflect the enduring reduction in US Treasury yields. The principal impact of this rate reduction was a $1.3 billion increase in the decommissioning provision with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment of $1.0 billion. Impairment discount rates and country risk premiums were unchanged due to COVID-19 from those reported in 2020. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions for further information.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2021 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of defined benefit obligations in the group's defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits and Note 23 for further information.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n179",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nThe current economic environment and future credit risk outlook were considered in updating the estimate of expected credit loss allowances on financial assets measured at amortized cost and no significant impact was determined relative to the total expected credit loss allowances recognized as at 31 December 2021. Management does not consider the calculation of expected credit loss allowances to be a significant accounting estimate. See Note 20 and 28 for further information.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe carrying amounts of the group's deferred tax assets were reviewed and updated to the extent that there are changes in the probability of sufficient taxable profits being available to utilize the reported deferred tax assets. Management does not consider the measurement of deferred tax assets to be a significant accounting estimate. See significant accounting policy: income taxes and Note 8 for further information.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, including when control is obtained via potential voting rights, and continue to be consolidated until the date that control ceases.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. Intragroup balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.\n\nUnrealized losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within non-controlling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued by subsidiaries and for which the group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset to the holders. Profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders is adjusted to reflect the coupon/interest related to these hybrid securities whether or not such distribution has been deferred.\n\n## Interests in other entities\n\n## Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair values of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The amount recognized for any non-controlling interest is measured at the present ownership's proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cashgenerating units, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 January 2003 is stated at the previous carrying amount under UK generally accepted accounting practice, less subsequent impairments.\n\nGoodwill may arise upon investments in joint ventures and associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Any such goodwill is recorded within the corresponding investment in joint ventures and associates.\n\nGoodwill may also arise upon acquisition of interests in joint operations that meet the definition of a business. The amount of goodwill separately recognized is the excess of the consideration transferred over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.\n\nCertain of the group's activities, particularly in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, are conducted through joint operations. bp recognizes, on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements, its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations incurred jointly with the other partners, along with the group's income from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses that the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation.\n\n## Interests in associates\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.\n\n## Significant judgements: investments in Rosneft and Aker BP\n\nJudgement is required in assessing the level of control or influence over another entity in which the group holds an interest. For bp, the judgements that the group had significant influence over Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft), a Russian oil and gas company, and expects to continue to have significant influence over Aker BP, a Norwegian oil and gas company, following completion of Aker BP's proposed acquisition of Lundin Energy, are significant.\n\nSignificant influence is defined in IFRS as the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those policies. Significant influence is presumed when an entity owns 20% or more of the voting power of the investee. Significant influence is presumed not to be present when an entity owns less than 20% of the voting power of the investee. IFRS identifies several indicators that may provide evidence of significant influence, including representation on the board of directors of the investee and participation in policy-making processes.\n\n180\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Rosneft\n\nAt 31 December 2021, bp owned 19.75% of the voting shares of Rosneft. Rosneft's largest shareholder is Rosneftegaz JSC (Rosneftegaz), which is wholly owned by the Russian government. At 31 December 2021, Rosneftegaz held 40.4% (2020 40.4%) of the voting shares of Rosneft. bp's group chief executive, Bernard Looney, was approved as a member of the board of directors of Rosneft in June 2020 as one of bp's two nominated directors. bp's other nominated director, Bob Dudley, was approved as a member of the Rosneft board in 2013. He was also chairman of the Rosneft board's Strategic and Sustainable Development Committee during 2021. bp also held the voting rights at general meetings of shareholders conferred by its 19.75% stake in Rosneft. bp's economic interest in Rosneft at 31 December 2021 was 22.03% (2020 22.03%), which was higher than bp's ownership stake due to transactions by Rosneft in its own shares in previous years. bp's management considers, therefore, that the group has significant influence over Rosneft, as defined by IFRS, as at 31 December 2021. As a consequence of this judgement, bp used the equity method of accounting for its investment and bp's share of Rosneft's oil and natural gas reserves was included in the group's estimated net proved reserves of equity-accounted entities.\n\nOn 27 February 2022, bp announced it will exit its shareholding in Rosneft. bp's two nominated directors to the Rosneft board stepped down from that date and submitted letters of resignation. As a result, bp's management considers that the group no longer has significant influence over Rosneft, as defined by IFRS, from that date. Following the loss of significant influence, bp's equity accounting of its investment ceased from that date and the investment will be accounted for as an investment in an equity instrument measured at fair value, as described under 'Financial assets' below, instead. No share of Rosneft's oil and natural gas reserves will be reported going forward. See Note 37 Events after the reporting period for further information.\n\n## Aker BP\n\nbp owned 27.85% of the voting shares of Aker BP at 31 December 2021 and significant influence was presumed. On completion of Aker BP's acquisition of Lundin Energy, which remains subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, bp expects its interest to be diluted to 15.9% of the voting shares of Aker BP as a result of new Aker BP shares being issued as partial consideration to Lundin Energy shareholders.\n\nbp's group chief financial officer, Murray Auchincloss, has been a member of the Aker BP board since 2017. bp's other nominated director, Kate Thomson has been a member of the Aker BP board since formation of that company in 2016. She is also a member of the Aker BP board's Audit and Risk Committee. These memberships are not expected to change following the transaction. bp also holds the voting rights at general meetings of shareholders conferred by its stake in Aker BP. bp's management considers, therefore, that the group will retain significant influence, as defined by IFRS, over Aker BP following the acquisition of Lundin Energy.\n\nAs a consequence of this judgement, bp has classified $0.6 billion as an asset held for sale, reflecting the highly probable deemed disposal of a part of bp's equity accounted interest as a result of the transaction. If significant influence was not present following completion, the carrying amount of bp's entire interest in Aker BP would be classified as an asset held for sale.\n\n## The equity method of accounting\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the group's share of net assets of the entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Loans advanced to equity-accounted entities that have the characteristics of equity financing are also included in the investment on the group balance sheet. The group income statement reflects the group's share of the results after tax of the equity-accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization and any impairment of the equityaccounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The group statement of comprehensive income includes the group's share of the equity-accounted entity's other comprehensive income. The group's share of amounts recognized directly in equity by an equity-accounted entity is recognized in the group's statement of changes in equity.\n\nFinancial statements of equity-accounted entities are prepared for the same reporting year as the group. Where material differences arise in the accounting policies used by the equity-accounted entity and those used by bp, adjustments are made to those financial statements to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of the group.\n\nUnrealized gains on transactions, apart from those that meet the definition of a derivative, between the group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the group's interest in the equity-accounted entity.\n\nThe group assesses investments in equity-accounted entities for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired. If any such objective evidence of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nThe group's operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the group that are evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer, bp's chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group's accounting policies described in this note, except that IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit before interest and tax. Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS. For further information see Note 4. bp changed its segmental reporting from 1 January 2021, see 'change in segmentation' below.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n181",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nIn individual subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of those entities at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement, unless hedge accounting is applied. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and related goodwill, are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange. In the consolidated financial statements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Exchange gains and losses arising on long-term intra-group foreign currency borrowings used to finance the group's nonUS dollar investments are also reported in other comprehensive income if the borrowings form part of the net investment in the subsidiary, joint venture or associate. On disposal or for certain partial disposals of a non-US dollar functional currency subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the related accumulated exchange gains and losses recognized in equity are reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nSignificant non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized, and equity accounting of associates and joint ventures is ceased once classified as held for sale.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, computer software, patents, licences and trademarks and are stated at the amount initially recognized, less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIntangible assets are carried initially at cost unless acquired as part of a business combination. Any such asset is measured at fair value at the date of the business combination and is recognized separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.\n\nIntangible assets with a finite life, other than capitalized exploration and appraisal costs as described below, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. For patents, licences and trademarks, expected useful life is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic useful life, and can range from three to fifteen years. Computer software costs generally have a useful life of three to five years.\n\nThe expected useful lives of assets and the amortization method are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the amortization method are accounted for prospectively.\n\n## Oil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure\n\nOil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure is accounted for using the principles of the successful efforts method of accounting as described below.\n\n## Licence and property acquisition costs\n\nExploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible assets and are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or planned or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations, and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned, the remaining balance of the licence and property acquisition costs is written off. Lower value licences are pooled and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated period of exploration. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves of oil and natural gas, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal expenditure\n\nGeological and geophysical exploration costs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially capitalized as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration, materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors. If potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration well costs are written off. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity, are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs continue to be carried as an asset. If it is determined that development will not occur, that is, the efforts are not successful, then the costs are expensed.\n\nCosts directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalized as an intangible asset. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment. If development is not approved and no further activity is expected to occur, then the costs are expensed.\n\nThe determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is usually made within one year of well completion, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure. Exploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure (e.g. an offshore platform or a pipeline) would be required before production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration or appraisal work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as such work is under way or firmly planned.\n\n182\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets\n\nJudgement is required to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to carry costs associated with exploration wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells on the balance sheet. This includes costs relating to exploration licences or leasehold property acquisitions. It is not unusual to have such costs remaining suspended on the balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and natural gas field is performed or while the optimum development plans and timing are established. The costs are carried based on the current regulatory and political environment or any known changes to that environment. All such carried costs are subject to regular technical, commercial and management review on at least an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value from, the discovery. Where this is no longer the case, the costs are immediately expensed.\n\nThe carrying amount of capitalized costs are included in Note 7.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment owned by the group is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if applicable, and, for assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, directly attributable general or specific finance costs. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.\n\nExpenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group, the expenditure is capitalized and the carrying amount of the replaced asset is derecognized. Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programmes are capitalized and amortized over the period to the next inspection. Overhaul costs for major maintenance programmes, and all other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nExpenditure on the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, including service and unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated from the commencement of production.\n\nOil and natural gas properties, including certain related pipelines, are depreciated using a unit-of-production method. The cost of producing wells is amortized over proved developed reserves. Licence acquisition, common facilities and future decommissioning costs are amortized over total proved reserves. The unit-of-production rate for the depreciation of common facilities takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated future capital expenditure expected to be incurred relating to as yet undeveloped reserves expected to be processed through these common facilities. Information on the carrying amounts of the group's oil and natural gas properties, together with the amounts recognized in the income statement as depreciation, depletion and amortization is contained in Note 11 and Note 4 respectively.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves determined in accordance with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, including the application of prices using 12-month historical price data in assessing the commerciality of technical volumes, are typically used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization charges for the group's oil and gas properties. Therefore, where this approach is adopted, charges are not dependent on management forecasts of future oil and gas prices.\n\nHowever, for certain oil and natural gas assets, the use of reserves determined in accordance with SEC regulations would result in a charge that is not reflective of the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. In these limited instances other approaches are applied to determine the reserves base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization, including the use of management's best estimate of price assumptions as disclosed in Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values, to determine the commerciality of technical proved reserves.\n\nThe impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production.\n\nThe estimation of oil and natural gas reserves and bp's process to manage reserves bookings is described in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas on page 254, which is unaudited. Details on bp's proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes are provided on page 348. The 2021 movements in proved reserves are reflected in the tables showing movements in oil and natural gas reserves by region in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas (unaudited) on page 254.\n\nOther property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life. The typical useful lives of the group's other property, plant and equipment on initial recognition are as follows:\n\n15 to 25 years\n\n| Land improvements     |                |\n|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings             | 20 to 50 years |\n| Refineries            | 20 to 30 years |\n| Pipelines             | 10 to 50 years |\n| Service stations      | 15 years       |\n| Office equipment      | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Fixtures and fittings | 5 to 15 years  |\n\nThe expected useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the depreciation method are accounted for prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the period in which the item is derecognized.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n183",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill\n\nThe group assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs), for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable; for example, changes in the group's business plans, plans to dispose rather than retain assets, changes in the group's assumptions about commodity prices, low plant utilization, evidence of physical damage or, for oil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning costs. If any such indication of impairment exists, the group makes an estimate of the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. Individual assets are grouped into CGUs for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. A CGU's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If it is probable that the value of the CGU will be primarily recovered through a disposal transaction, the expected disposal proceeds are considered in determining the recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\nThe business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use. They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of refined products (e.g. gasoline and lubricants), revenues, costs and capital expenditure. Carbon taxes and costs of emissions allowances are included in estimates of future cash flows, where applicable, based on the regulatory environment in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various assumptions regarding market conditions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, refining margins, refined product margins and cost inflation rates are set by senior management. These assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group to the extent that they are not already reflected in the discount rate and are discounted to their present value typically using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.\n\nFair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the group and not applicable to entities in general. In limited circumstances where recent market transactions are not available for reference, discounted cash flow techniques are applied. Where discounted cash flow analyses are used to calculate fair value less costs of disposal, estimates are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset, CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and the test is performed on a post-tax basis.\n\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit or loss. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates should be assessed. In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs is less than the carrying amount (including goodwill), an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\n\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Judgement is required when determining the appropriate grouping of assets into a CGU or the appropriate grouping of CGUs for impairment testing purposes. For example, individual oil and gas properties may form separate CGUs whilst certain oil and gas properties with shared infrastructure may be grouped together to form a single CGU. Alternative groupings of assets or CGUs may result in a different outcome from impairment testing. See Note 13 for details on how these groupings have been determined in relation to the impairment testing of goodwill.\n\nAs described above, the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data.\n\nDetails of impairment charges and reversals recognized in the income statement are provided in Note 4 and details on the carrying amounts of assets are shown in Note 11, Note 13 and Note 14.\n\nThe estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2021 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. Changes in the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.\n\n184\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Discount rates\n\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a post-tax discount rate.\n\nThe discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2021, the post-tax discount rate was 6% (2020 6%) other than for low carbon energy assets where the risk profile of expected cash flows supported a lower rate of 4%. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk an additional premium of 1% to 3% was reflected in the post-tax discount rate (2020 1% to 3%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various economic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate typically ranged from 7% to 15% (2020 7% to 15%) depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU.\n\n## Oil and natural gas properties\n\nFor oil and natural gas properties in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, expected future cash flows are estimated using management's best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, and production and reserves and certain resources volumes. Forecast cash flows include the impact of all approved emission reduction projects. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors.\n\nIn 2021, the group identified oil and gas properties in these segments with carrying amounts totalling $26,341 million (2020 $45,027 million) where the headroom, based on the most recent impairment test performed in the year on those assets, was less than or equal to 20% of the carrying value. A change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. Management considers that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year, see Sensitivity analyses, below.\n\nThe recoverability of intangible exploration and appraisal expenditure is covered under Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development expenditure above.\n\n## Oil and natural gas prices\n\nThe price assumptions used for value-in-use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp's carbon emissions cost assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 178. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets, and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lowercarbon supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\n\nDuring the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing for Brent oil up to 2030 were increased to reflect near-term supply constraints. bp's management also expects an acceleration of the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy. As such, the long-term Brent oil assumptions were decreased during the year, reaching $55 per barrel by 2040 and $45 per barrel by 2050 (in 2020 real terms). The price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing for Henry Hub gas were unchanged to those used in 2020 except that the assumption for 2022 was increased to reflect short term market conditions. These price assumptions are derived from the central case investment appraisal assumptions, adjusted where applicable to reflect short-term market conditions (see page 32). A summary of the group's revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas, applied in 2021 and 2020, in real 2020 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management's best estimate of future prices at the balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. An inflation rate of 2% (2020 2%) is applied to determine the price assumptions in nominal terms.\n\n| 2021 price assumptions   |   2022 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |    2050 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |     70 |     60 |     60 |     55 |   45    |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |      4 |      3 |      3 |      3 |    2.75 |\n| 2020 price assumptions   |   2021 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 | 2050    |\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |     50 |     50 |     60 |     60 |   50    |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |      3 |      3 |      3 |      3 |    2.75 |\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n185",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nThe majority of bp's reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the group's existing oil and gas properties are expected to be produced over the next 10 years.\n\nThe oil market continued its rebalancing process in 2021. Brent oil prices averaged $71/bbl in 2021. That is 70% higher than in 2020 and the second highest since 2015. Oil demand rebounded on the back of the economic recovery, supported by the increasing COVID-19 vaccination roll-out and gradual lifting of restrictions. On the supply side, continued active supply management by OPEC+ countries also helped accelerate the rebalancing process. bp's long-term assumption for oil prices is lower than the 2021 price average, based on the judgement that, in the long term, oil demand is likely to fall so that the price levels needed to encourage sufficient investment to meet declining global oil demand is also lower.\n\nUS gas prices almost doubled in 2021 to $3.9/mmbtu from $2.0/mmbtu in 2020. The higher prices reflect a tighter demand/supply balance for 2021 when compared to 2020. Early in the year, colder weather increased demand and decreased supply resulting in a large draw on storage and therefore the need to replenish it over the summer. Strong global GDP recovery also saw a recovery in LNG exports from the US relative to the shut-ins in 2020. Further, higher coal prices also supported gas prices through competition in the power sector. The level of US gas prices in 2021 is above bp's long term price assumption based on the judgement of the price level required to incentivize new production.\n\n## Oil and natural gas reserves\n\nIn addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the group's estimated oil and natural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the group's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nReserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.\n\n## Sensitivity analyses\n\nManagement considers discount rates, oil and natural gas prices and production to be the key sources of estimation uncertainty in determining the recoverable amount of upstream oil and gas assets. The sensitivity analyses below, in addition to covering the key sources of estimation uncertainty, also indicate how the energy transition, potential future carbon emissions costs for operational GHG emissions and/or reduced demand for oil and gas may further impact forecast revenue cash inflows to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group's value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs, if carbon emissions costs were to be implemented as a deduction against revenue cash flows. The analyses therefore represent a net revenue sensitivity.\n\nA change in net revenue from upstream oil and gas properties can arise either due to changes in oil and natural gas prices, carbon emissions costs/ carbon prices, changes in oil and natural gas production, or a combination of these.\n\nManagement tested the impact of a change in net revenue cash flows in value-in-use impairment testing up to a combined effect on net revenue of 20% in all future years.\n\nNet revenue reductions of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp's currently held upstream oil and gas properties in the range of $16-17 billion, which is approximately 14-15% of the net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2021. If this net revenue reduction was solely due to reductions in oil prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative decrease in the carrying amount of using price assumptions for Brent oil broadly in the middle of the range of prices associated with a pre-publication version (see page 64) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 'family' of scenarios considered to be consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nNet revenue increases of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to an increase in the carrying amount of bp's currently held upstream oil and gas properties in the range of $3-4 billion, which is approximately 3-4% of the net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2021. This potential increase in the carrying amount would arise due to reversals of previously recognized impairments and represents approximately half of the total impairment reversal capacity available at 31 December 2021. If this net revenue increase was solely due to increases in oil prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative increase in the carrying amount of using price assumptions for Brent oil broadly at the top end of the range of prices associated with a pre-publication version of the WBCSD 'family' of scenarios considered to be consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThese sensitivity analyses do not, however, represent management's best estimate of any impairment charges or reversals that might be recognized as they do not fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and phasing of development. For example, costs across the industry are more likely to decrease as oil and natural gas prices fall. The analyses also assume the impact of increases in carbon price on operational GHG emissions are fully absorbed as a decrease in net revenue (and vice versa) rather than reflecting how carbon prices or other carbon emissions costs may ultimately be incorporated by the market. The above sensitivity analyses therefore do not reflect a linear relationship between net revenue and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and factors plus the diverse characteristics of our upstream oil and gas properties limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall recoverable amount is impacted by changes to the price assumptions or production volumes.\n\nManagement also tested the impact of a one percentage point change in the discount rate used for value-in-use impairment testing of upstream oil and gas properties. This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within the next financial year. If the discount rate was one percentage point higher across all tests performed, the net impairment reversal recognized in 2021 would have been approximately $1.3 billion lower. If the discount rate was one percentage point lower, the net impairment reversal recognized would have been approximately $0.6 billion higher.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nIrrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, bp is required to test annually for impairment of goodwill acquired in business combinations. The group carries goodwill of approximately $12.4 billion on its balance sheet (2020 $12.5 billion), principally relating to the Atlantic Richfield, Burmah Castrol, Devon Energy and Reliance transactions. Of this, $7.6 billion relates to goodwill in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, for which oil and gas price and production assumptions are key sources of estimation uncertainty. Sensitivities and additional information relating to impairment testing of goodwill in these segments are provided in Note 13.\n\n186\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, other than inventories held for short-term trading purposes, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, transportation and manufacturing expenses. Net realizable value is determined by reference to prices existing at the balance sheet date, adjusted where the sale of inventories after the reporting period gives evidence about their net realizable value at the end of the period.\n\nInventories held for short-term trading purposes are stated at fair value less costs to sell and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement.\n\nSupplies are valued at the lower of cost on a weighted-average basis and net realizable value.\n\n## Leases\n\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration are accounted for as leases. The right to control is conveyed if bp has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and the right to direct the use of, the identified asset throughout the period of use. An asset is identified if it is explicitly or implicitly specified by the agreement and any substitution rights held by the lessor over the asset are not considered substantive.\n\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an intangible asset including rights to explore for or use hydrocarbons are not accounted for as leases. See significant accounting policy: intangible assets.\n\nA lease liability is recognized on the balance sheet on the lease commencement date at the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the lease if readily determinable, otherwise an incremental borrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on factors such as the group's cost of borrowing, lessee legal entity credit risk, currency and lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a lease together with any periods covered by an extension option that bp is reasonably certain to exercise, or periods covered by a termination option that bp is reasonably certain not to exercise. The future lease payments included in the present value calculation are any fixed payments, payments that vary depending on an index or rate, payments due for the reasonably certain exercise of options and expected residual value guarantee payments. Repayments of principal are presented as financing cash flows and payments of interest are presented as operating cash flows.\n\nPayments that vary based on factors other than an index or a rate such as usage, sales volumes or revenues are not included in the present value calculation and are recognized in the income statement and presented as operating cash flows. The lease liability is recognized on an amortized cost basis with interest expense recognized in the income statement over the lease term, except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development expenditure.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is recognized on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at a value equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives, initial direct costs and any restoration obligations. The right-of-use asset is depreciated typically on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation charge is recognized in the income statement except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development expenditure. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment in line with the accounting policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nAgreements may include both lease and non-lease components. Payments for lease and non-lease components are allocated on a relative stand-alone selling price basis except for leases of retail service stations where the group has elected not to separate non-lease payments from the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset.\n\nIf the lease term at commencement of the agreement is less than 12 months, a lease liability and right-of-use asset are not recognized, and a lease expense is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis.\n\nIf a significant event or change in circumstances, within the control of bp, arises that affects the reasonably certain lease term or there are changes to the lease payments, the present value of the lease liability is remeasured using the revised term and payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by an equivalent amount.\n\nModifications to a lease agreement beyond the original terms and conditions are accounted for as a re-measurement of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Any gain or loss on modification is recognized in the income statement. Modifications that increase the scope of the lease at a price commensurate with the stand-alone selling price are accounted for as a separate new lease.\n\nThe group recognizes the full lease liability, rather than its working interest share, for leases entered into on behalf of a joint operation if the group has the primary responsibility for making the lease payments. This may be the case if for example bp, as operator of the joint operation, is the sole signatory to the lease. In such cases, bp's working interest share of the right-of-use asset is recognized if it is jointly controlled by the group and the other joint operators, and a receivable is recognized for the share of the asset transferred to the other joint operators. If bp is a non-operator, a payable to the operator is recognized if they have the primary responsibility for making the lease payments and bp has joint control over the right-of-use asset, otherwise no balances are recognized.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through  profit  or  loss,  directly  attributable  transaction  costs  are  also  included.  The  subsequent  measurement  of  financial  assets  depends  on  their classification, as set out below. The group derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the  asset  have  neither  been  retained  nor  transferred  but  control  of  the  asset  has  been  transferred.  This  includes  the derecognition of receivables for which discounting arrangements are entered into.\n\nThe group classifies its financial asset debt instruments as measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired and when interest is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n187",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when they are held in a business model the objective of which is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss when the asset does not meet the criteria to be measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. Such assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nInvestments in equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss unless an election is made on an instrument-byinstrument basis to recognize fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nThe group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost at each balance sheet date. Expected credit losses are measured based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. As lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the tenor of substantially all other in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses for the group. The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows the group expects to receive discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is adjusted, with the amount of the impairment gain or loss recognized in the income statement.\n\nA financial asset or group of financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost is considered to be credit-impaired if there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset (or group of financial assets) have occurred. Financial assets are written off where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering amounts due.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nInstruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. Instruments that cannot be settled in the group's own equity instruments and that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity that are potentially unfavourable are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the group are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognized when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group derecognizes financial liabilities when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as follows:\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.\n\n## Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nAll other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\n\nAfter initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.\n\nThis category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt.\n\n## Significant judgement: supplier financing arrangements\n\nThe group's trade payables include some supplier arrangements that utilize letter of credit facilities. Judgement is required to assess the payables subject to these arrangements to determine whether they should continue to be classified as trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows or finance debt and financing cash flows. The criteria used in making this assessment include the payment terms for the amount due relative to terms commonly seen in the markets in which bp operates and whether the arrangements significantly change the nature of the liability. Liabilities subject to these arrangements with payment terms of up to approximately 60 days are generally considered to be trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows.

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe group issues financial guarantee contracts to make specified payments to reimburse holders for losses incurred because certain associates, joint ventures or third-party entities fail to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument such as a loan. The liability for a financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract's estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nThe group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as for trading purposes. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item (for example, oil, oil products, gas or power) that can be settled net in cash, with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, are accounted for as financial instruments. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement.\n\nIf, at inception of a contract, the valuation cannot be supported by observable market data, any gain or loss determined by the valuation methodology is not recognized in the income statement but is deferred on the balance sheet and is commonly known as a 'day-one gain or loss'. This deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all the remaining contract term can be valued using observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. Changes in valuation subsequent to the initial valuation at inception of a contract are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value hedges when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability.\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.\n\nHedge relationships are formally designated and documented at inception, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, the existence at inception of an economic relationship and subsequent measurement of the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the hedge ratio and sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Hedges meeting the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe change in fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss, where it offsets. The group applies fair value hedge accounting when hedging interest rate risk and certain currency risks on fixed rate finance debt.\n\nFair value hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when the risk management objective changes or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised. The accumulated adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item at such time is then amortized prospectively to profit or loss as finance interest expense over the hedged item's remaining period to maturity.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedging instrument is reported in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\nWhere the hedged item is a highly probably forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, such as a forecast foreign currency transaction for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognized within other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. Where the hedged item is an equity investment, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income remain in the separate component of equity until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss or when accounting under the equity method is discontinued. Where the hedged item is recognized directly in profit or loss, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to production and manufacturing expenses or sales and other operating revenues as appropriate.\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when the designated hedged forecast transaction or part thereof is no longer considered to be highly probable to occur, or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover. When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued amounts previously recognized within other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized within other comprehensive income will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Costs of hedging\n\nThe foreign currency basis spread of cross-currency interest rate swaps are excluded from hedge designations and accounted for as costs of hedging. Changes in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread are recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that they relate to the hedged item. For time-period related hedged items, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is amortized to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the term of the hedging relationship.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The group categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three levels depending on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or bp's assumptions about pricing by market participants.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n189",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments\n\nIn some cases the fair values of derivatives are estimated using internal models due to the absence of quoted prices or other observable, marketcorroborated data. This primarily applies to the group's longer-term derivative contracts. The majority of these contracts are valued using models with inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from available active market pricing data (including volatility and correlation) and modelled using the maximum available external information. Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are determined using historical and long-term pricing relationships. The use of alternative assumptions or valuation methodologies may result in significantly different values for these derivatives. A reasonably possible change in the price assumptions used in the models relating to index price would not have a material impact on net assets and the Group income statement primarily as a result of offsetting movements between derivative assets and liabilities. For more information, including the carrying amounts of level 3 derivatives, see Note 29.\n\nIn some cases, judgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell commodities meet the definition of a derivative or to determine appropriate presentation and classification of transactions in certain cases. In particular, contracts to buy and sell LNG are not considered to meet the definition as they are not considered capable of being net settled due to a lack of liquidity in the LNG market and the inability or lack of history of net settlement and so are accounted for on an accruals basis, rather than as a derivative.\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the balance sheet unless both of the following criteria are met: the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; and the group intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. A right of set off is the group's legal right to settle an amount payable to a creditor by applying against it an amount receivable from the same counterparty. The relevant legal jurisdiction and laws applicable to the relationships between the parties are considered when assessing whether a current legally enforceable right to set off exists.\n\n## Provisions and contingencies\n\nProvisions are recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where appropriate, the future cash flow estimates are adjusted to reflect risks specific to the liability.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized within finance costs. Provisions are discounted using a nominal discount rate of 2.0% (2020 2.5%).\n\nProvisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the group, or present obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are disclosed, if material, unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.\n\n## Decommissioning\n\nLiabilities for decommissioning costs are recognized when the group has an obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. Where an obligation exists for a new facility or item of plant, such as oil and natural gas production or transportation facilities, this liability will be recognized on construction or installation. Similarly, where an obligation exists for a well, this liability is recognized when it is drilled. An obligation for decommissioning may also crystallize during the period of operation of a well, facility or item of plant through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations; an obligation may also arise in cases where an asset has been sold but the subsequent owner is no longer able to fulfil its decommissioning obligations, for example due to bankruptcy. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. The provision for the costs of decommissioning wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives is estimated using existing technology, at future prices, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using the nominal discount rate.\n\nAn amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is recognized as part of the corresponding intangible asset (in the case of an exploration or appraisal well) or property, plant and equipment. The decommissioning portion of the property, plant and equipment is subsequently depreciated at the same rate as the rest of the asset. Other than the unwinding of discount on or utilization of the provision, any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset where that asset is generating or is expected to generate future economic benefits.\n\n## Environmental expenditures and liabilities\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that are required in order for the group to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those assets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed.\n\nLiabilities for environmental costs are recognized when a clean-up is probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated. Generally, the timing of recognition of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.\n\nThe amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions for environmental liabilities have been estimated using existing technology, at future prices and discounted using a nominal discount rate.\n\n## Emissions\n\nLiabilities for emissions are recognized when the cumulative volumes of gases emitted by the group at the end of the reporting period exceed the allowances granted free of charge held for own use or a set baseline for emissions. The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. It is based on the excess of actual emissions over the free allowances held or set baseline in tonnes (or other appropriate quantity) and is valued at the actual cost of any allowances that have been purchased and held for own use on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, and, if insufficient allowances are held, for the remaining requirement on the basis of the spot market price of allowances at the balance sheet date. The cost of allowances purchased to cover a shortfall is recognized separately on the balance sheet as an intangible asset unless the emission allowances acquired or generated by the group are risk-managed by the shipping & trading function, then they are recognized on the balance sheet as inventory.\n\n190\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nThe reinvent bp programme, expected to reduce headcount by around 10,000 positions, has resulted in recognition of provisions, primarily in the comparative period, where a detailed formal plan exists, and a valid expectation of risk of redundancy has been made to those affected but where the specific outcomes remain uncertain. Where formal redundancy offers have been made, the obligations for those amounts are reported as payables and, if not, as provisions if unpaid at the year-end.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates: provisions\n\nThe group holds provisions for the future decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives. The largest decommissioning obligations facing bp relate to the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal and disposal of oil and natural gas platforms and pipelines around the world. Most of these decommissioning events are many years in the future and the precise requirements that will have to be met when the removal event occurs are uncertain. Decommissioning technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are political, environmental, safety and public expectations. The timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty and estimation is required in determining the amounts of provisions to be recognized. Any changes in the expected future costs are reflected in both the provision and the asset.\n\nIf oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties, judgement is required to assess whether the new owner will be unable to meet their decommissioning obligations, whether bp would then be responsible for decommissioning, and if so the extent of that responsibility. The group has assessed that $0.5 billion of decommissioning provisions should be recognized as at 31 December 2021 (2020 no significant provisions) for assets previously sold to third parties where the sale transferred the decommissioning obligation to the new owner.\n\nDecommissioning provisions associated with downstream refineries are generally not recognized, as the potential obligations cannot be measured, given their indeterminate settlement dates. Obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations and any such obligations would be recognized in the period when sufficient information becomes available to determine potential settlement dates (see Note 32 for further information).\n\nThe group performs periodic reviews of its downstream refineries for any changes in facts and circumstances including those relating to the energy transition, that might require the recognition of a decommissioning provision. Portfolio strength and flexibility are such that the point of cessation of manufacturing at the group's operating refineries cannot yet be reliably determined for the purposes of determining a decommissioning provision.\n\nThe provision for environmental liabilities is estimated based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology, price levels and expected plans for remediation. Actual costs and cash outflows can differ from current estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public expectations, prices, discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean-up technology.\n\nThe timing and amount of future expenditures relating to decommissioning and environmental liabilities are reviewed annually. The interest rate used in discounting the cash flows is reviewed quarterly. The nominal interest rate used to determine the balance sheet obligations at the end of 2021 was 2.0% (2020 2.5%), which was based on long-dated US government bonds. The weighted average period over which decommissioning and environmental costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately 17 years (2020 18 years) and 6 years (2020 6 years) respectively. Costs at future prices are determined by applying an inflation rate of 1.5% (2020 1.5%) to decommissioning costs and 2% (2020 2%) for all other provisions. A lower rate is typically applied to decommissioning as certain costs are expected to remain fixed at current or past prices.\n\nThe estimated phasing of undiscounted cash flows in real terms for upstream decommissioning is approximately $5.3 billion (2020 $3.9 billion) within the next 10 years, $6.9 billion (2020 $7.7 billion) in 10 to 20 years and the remainder of approximately $6.0 billion (2020 $6.0 billion) after 20 years. The timing and amount of decommissioning cash flows are inherently uncertain and therefore the phasing is management's current best estimate but may not be what will ultimately occur.\n\nFurther information about the group's provisions is provided in Note 23. Changes in assumptions in relation to the group's provisions could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year. A 0.5 percentage point increase in the nominal discount rate applied could decrease the group's provision balances by approximately $1.4 billion (2020 $1.2 billion). The pre-tax impact on the group income statement would be a credit of approximately $0.4 billion (2020 $0.3 billion). This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within the next financial year.\n\nThe discounting impact on the group's decommissioning provisions for oil and gas properties in the oil productions & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments of a two-year change in the timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures is approximately $0.2 billion (2020 $0.3 billion). Management currently does not consider a change of greater than two years to be reasonably possible in the next financial year. If all expected future decommissioning expenditures were 10% higher, then these decommissioning provisions would increase by approximately $1.6 billion (2020 $1.4 billion) and a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.4 billion (2020 $0.5 billion) would be recognized.\n\nAs described in Note 32, the group is subject to claims and actions for which no provisions have been recognized. The facts and circumstances relating to particular cases are evaluated regularly in determining whether a provision relating to a specific litigation should be recognized or revised. Accordingly, significant management judgement relating to provisions and contingent liabilities is required, since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nWages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the group. Deferred bonus arrangements that have a vesting date more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are valued on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period until the award vests. The accounting policies for share-based payments and for pensions and other post-retirement benefits are described below.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\n## Equity-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date on which they are granted and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award. A corresponding credit is recognized within equity. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used, valuation model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company (market conditions). Non-vesting conditions, such as the condition that employees contribute to a savings-related plan, are taken into account in the grant-date fair value, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition, where this is within the control of the employee is treated as a cancellation and any remaining .\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n191",

For other equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the corresponding increase in equity are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless their fair value cannot be reliably estimated. If the fair value of the goods and services received cannot be reliably estimated, the transaction is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n## Cash-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of cash-settled transactions is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, measured by reference to the fair value of the corresponding liability which is recognized on the balance sheet. The liability is remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the group's defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.\n\nNet interest expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.\n\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\n\n## Significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions and other post-retirement benefits involves making significant estimates when measuring the group's pension plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\n\nPensions and other post-retirement benefit assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the group's balance sheet, and pension and other post-retirement benefit expense for the following year.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the group's pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations within the next financial year, in particular for the UK, US and Eurozone plans. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\n\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation used are provided in Note 23.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\n\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n- \u00b7 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and, at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n- \u00b7 In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and, at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductive temporary differences.\n\n192\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nIn respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable or increased to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\nWhere tax treatments are uncertain, if it is considered probable that a taxation authority will accept the group's proposed tax treatment, income taxes are recognized consistent with the group's income tax filings. If it is not considered probable, the uncertainty is reflected within the carrying amount of the applicable tax asset or liability using either the most likely amount or an expected value, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\nThe computation of the group's income tax expense and liability involves the interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions throughout the world. The resolution of tax positions taken by the group, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take several years to complete and in some cases it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. Therefore, judgement is required to determine whether provisions for income taxes are required and, if so, estimation is required of the amounts that could be payable.\n\nIn addition, the group has carry-forward tax losses and tax credits in certain taxing jurisdictions that are available to offset against future taxable profit. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or tax credits can be utilized. Management judgement is exercised in assessing whether this is the case and estimates are required to be made of the amount of future taxable profits that will be available. Such judgements are inherently impacted by estimates affecting future taxable profits such as oil and natural gas prices and decommissioning expenditure, see significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions\n\nManagement do not assess there to be a significant risk of a material change to the group's tax provisioning or recognition of deferred tax assets within the next financial year, however the tax position remains inherently uncertain and therefore subject to change. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, income tax charges or credits, and changes in current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, may arise in future periods. For more information see Note 8 and Note 32.\n\nJudgement is also required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax (for example a production tax). Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes as described above, but is not applied to other types of taxes; rather such taxes are recognized in the income statement in accordance with the applicable accounting policy such as Provisions and contingencies. No new significant judgements were made in 2021 in this regard.\n\n## Customs duties and sales taxes\n\nCustoms duties and sales taxes that are passed on or charged to customers are excluded from revenues and expenses. Assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of customs duties or sales tax except:\n\n- \u00b7 Customs duties or sales taxes incurred on the purchase of goods and services which are not recoverable from the taxation authority are recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset.\n- \u00b7 Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of customs duty or sales tax included.\n\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included within receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\n## Own equity instruments - treasury shares\n\nThe group's holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders' equity. Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the consolidated financial statements as treasury shares. The cost of treasury shares subsequently sold or reissued is calculated on a weighted-average basis. Consideration, if any, received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares. Shares repurchased under the share buy-back programme which are immediately cancelled are not shown as treasury shares, but are shown as a deduction from the profit and loss account reserve in the group statement of changes in equity.\n\n## Revenue and other income\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized when or as the group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. The transfer of control of oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG, petroleum and chemical products, and other items usually coincides with title passing to the customer and the customer taking physical possession. The group principally satisfies its performance obligations at a point in time; the amounts of revenue recognized relating to performance obligations satisfied over time are not significant.\n\nWhen, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, the group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the group expects to be entitled. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone selling prices of the goods or services promised.\n\nContracts for the sale of commodities are typically priced by reference to quoted prices. Revenue from term commodity contracts is recognized based on the contractual pricing provisions for each delivery. Certain of these contracts have pricing terms based on prices at a point in time after delivery has been made. Revenue from such contracts is initially recognized based on relevant prices at the time of delivery and subsequently adjusted as appropriate. All revenue from these contracts, both that recognized at the time of delivery and that from post-delivery price adjustments, is disclosed as revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n193",

There are no other new or amended standards or interpretations adopted during the year that have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase II'\n\nThe replacement of key interest rate benchmarks such as the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) with alternative benchmarks in the US, UK, EU and other territories occurred at the end of 2021 for most benchmarks, with remaining USD LIBOR tenors expected to cease in 2023. bp is primarily exposed to 3 month USD LIBOR that will be available until June 2023.\n\nAmendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and other IFRSs were issued by the IASB in August 2020 to provide practical expedients and reliefs when changes are made to contractual cash flows or hedging relationships because of the transition from Inter-bank Offered Rates to alternative risk-free rates. bp adopted these amendments from 1 January 2021 and they were applied prospectively from that date. See Note 28 for further information.\n\nbp has an internal working group on interest rate benchmark reform to monitor market developments and manage the transition to alternative benchmark rates. The impacts on contracts and arrangements that are linked to interest rate benchmarks, for example, borrowings, leases and derivative contracts, have been assessed and transition plans have either been executed or are being developed. bp is also participating on external committees and task forces dedicated to interest rate benchmark reform.\n\n## Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards - Not yet adopted\n\nThe following pronouncements from the IASB have not been adopted by the group in these financial statements as they will only become effective for future financial reporting periods. There are no other standards, amendments or interpretations in issue but not yet adopted that the directors anticipate will have a material effect on the reported income or net assets of the group.\n\n## IFRS 17 ' Insurance Contracts'\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' provides a new general model for accounting for contracts where the issuer accepts significant insurance risk from another party and agrees to compensate that party if a future uncertain event adversely affects them. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' and will be effective for bp for the financial reporting period commencing 1 January 2023. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the UK and the EU. bp's assessment of the impact of IFRS 17 is at an initial stage but it is not expected to have a significant effect on future financial reporting.\n\n## Other changes to significant accounting policies\n\n## Change in segmentation\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the group's reportable segments changed consistent with a change in the way that resources are allocated and performance is assessed, from that date, by the chief operating decision maker, who for bp is the chief executive officer. From the first quarter of 2021, the group's reportable segments are gas & low carbon energy, oil production & operations, customers & products, and Rosneft. At 31 December 2020, the group's reportable segments were Upstream, Downstream and Rosneft.\n\nGas & low carbon energy comprises regions with upstream businesses that predominantly produce natural gas, gas marketing and trading activities and the group's solar, wind and hydrogen businesses. Gas producing regions were previously in the Upstream segment. The group's renewables businesses were previously part of 'Other businesses and corporate'.\n\nOil production & operations comprises regions with upstream activities that predominantly produce crude oil. These activities were previously in the Upstream segment.\n\nCustomers & products comprises the group's customer-focused businesses, spanning convenience and mobility, which includes retail and fuels nextgen offers such as electrification, as well as aviation, midstream and Castrol lubricants. It also includes our oil products businesses, refining & trading. The petrochemicals business is also reported in restated comparative information as part of the customers and products segment up to its sale in December 2020. The customers & products segment is, therefore, substantially unchanged from the former Downstream segment with the exception of the Petrochemicals disposal.\n\nThe Rosneft segment was unchanged and continues to include equity-accounted earnings from the group's investment in Rosneft. The group will cease to report Rosneft as a separate segment in the group's financial reporting for 2022. See Note 37 Events after the reporting period.\n\n194\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nThe segment measure of profit or loss continues to be replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax, which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss before interest and tax inventory holding gains and losses. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nComparative information for 2019 and 2020 has been restated in Notes 3, 4 and 13 to reflect the changes in reportable segments. References to segments have also changed in Notes 2, 7, 15 and 27.\n\nVoluntary change in accounting policy - Net presentation of revenues and purchases relating to physically settled derivative contracts from 1 January 2021\n\nbp routinely enters into transactions for the sale and purchase of commodities that are physically settled and meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument. These contracts are within the scope of IFRS 9 and as such, prior to settlement, changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts are presented as gains and losses within other operating revenues. The group previously presented revenues and purchases for such contracts on a gross basis in the income statement upon physical settlement.\n\nThese transactions have historically represented a substantial portion of the revenues and purchases reported in the group's consolidated financial statements. The change in strategic direction of the group supported by organizational changes to implement the strategy from 1 January 2021, resulted in the group determining that the revenue and corresponding purchases relating to such transactions should be presented net, as gains or losses within other operating revenues, from that date. Physically settled derivative contracts were previously presented on a gross basis and included in other operating revenues and purchases; however, under the new accounting policy, such contracts will be presented on a net basis within other operating revenues to the extent that they relate to trading or optimization activities.\n\nAdditionally, the group's trading activity has continued to evolve over time from one of capturing third-party physical trades to provide flow assurance to one with increasing levels of optimization, taking advantage of price volatility and fluctuations in demand and supply, which will continue under the new strategy, further supporting the change in presentation. The new presentation provides reliable and more relevant information for users of the accounts as the group's revenue recognition is more closely aligned with how management monitors and manages performance of such contracts. Comparative information for sales and other operating revenues and purchases for 2019 and 2020 has been restated as shown in the table below. There is no impact on comparative information for profit before income tax or earnings per share.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n195",

Subject to regulatory and other approvals, the transaction is expected to complete during the first half of 2022. Assets of $1,009 million and associated liabilities of $333 million have been classified as held for sale in the group balance sheet at 31 December 2021.\n\nOn 21 December 2021, Aker BP, an associate of bp, announced the proposed acquisition of Lundin Energy for consideration in cash and new Aker BP shares. Subject to regulatory and other approvals, the transaction is expected to complete mid-year 2022. bp currently holds a 27.9% interest in Aker BP. Following the transaction this is expected to become a 15.9% interest in the combined company. $595 million of bp's investment in AkerBP has therefore been classified as held for sale in the group's balance sheet.\n\nNo transactions have been classified as held for sale during 2021 which were completed by 31 December 2021.\n\n## gas & low carbon energy\n\nThe assets held for sale balance at 31 December 2020 consists primarily of a 20% participating interest from bp's 60% participating interest in Block 61 in Oman. As announced on 1 February 2021, bp agreed to sell this interest to PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited of Thailand. The sale was approved by Royal Decree on 28 March 2021 and $2.4 billion was received in March 2021.\n\nThe total assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2021 and 2020, which are all in gas & low carbon energy and oil productions & operations, are set out in the table below.\n\n|                                                                         | $ million   | $ million   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                                         | 2021        | 2020        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                           | 35          | 1,099       |\n| Goodwill                                                                | 137         | 199         |\n| Investments in associates                                               | 632         | -           |\n| Inventories                                                             | 152         | -           |\n| Trade and other receivables                                             | 696         | 28          |\n| Assets classified as held for sale                                      | 1,652       | 1,326       |\n| Trade and other payables                                                | (238)       | (36)        |\n| Lease liabilities                                                       | (74)        | -           |\n| Provisions                                                              | (47)        | (10)        |\n| Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale | (359)       | (46)        |\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n197",

At 31 December 2021, deferred consideration relating to disposals amounted to $205 million receivable within one year (2020 $1,291 million and 2019 $159 million) and $823 million receivable after one year (2020 $2,402 million and 2019 $125 million). The deferred consideration principally relates to the disposals of our Alaskan business in 2020. In addition, contingent consideration receivable relating to disposals amounted to $1,917 million at 31 December 2021 (2020 $1,999 million and 2019 $598 million). The contingent consideration at 31 December 2021 relates to the prior period disposals of our Alaskan business and certain assets in the North Sea. These amounts of contingent consideration are reported within Other investments on the group balance sheet - see Note 17 for further information.\n\nDuring the year, the group disposed of a $1,675 million loan note related to the Alaska divestment. As a result of potential partial recourse from the counterparty, the group continues to recognize an asset of $547 million and an associated liability of $598 million, both of which will reduce over time.\n\n## Gains and losses on sale of businesses and fixed assets, and closures\n\n## gas & low carbon energy\n\nIn 2021 gains on disposal of businesses and fixed assets were principally related to a $1,031 million gain on disposal of a 20% participating interest in Block 61 in Oman.\n\n198\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

The 2021 impairment reversals of $2,479 million principally arose as a result of changes to the group's oil and gas price assumptions and re-assessment of reserves. They include amounts in BPX Energy ($1,356 million) and the North Sea ($950 million). The principal CGU on which a significant impairment reversal was recognized was $982 million for Hawkville in BPX Energy. The recoverable amount of these CGUs on which significant impairment charges or reversals were recognized, based on their value in use, is $6,760 million. The recoverable amount of all CGUs for which impairment charges or reversals were recognized in 2021, based on their value in use, is $16,586 million.\n\nThe 2020 impairment loss of $6,723 million primarily relates to losses incurred in respect of producing and development assets in the UK North Sea ($2,796 million), the US ($2,744 million), and Canada ($865 million). Impairment losses were primarily driven by a reduction in bp's future oil and gas price assumptions and, to a lesser extent, certain technical reserves revisions.\n\nThe 2019 impairment losses of $6,365 million related to various assets, with the most significant charges arising in the US. Impairment losses arose primarily as a result of the decision to dispose of certain assets, including $4,703 million in relation to completed and expected disposals in BPX Energy and $1,264 million relating to the expected disposal of our Alaskan business; of these amounts $355 million primarily relates to impairment of associated goodwill.\n\n## customers & products\n\n2021 impairment losses of $962 million principally relates to anticipated portfolio changes in the products business ($595 million).\n\nImpairment losses totalling $840 million and $65 million were recognized in 2020 and 2019 respectively. The amount for 2020 principally relates to portfolio changes in the fuels business, including the conversion of Kwinana refinery to an import terminal. None of the impairment charges were individually material.\n\n## Other businesses and corporate\n\nImpairment losses totalling $63 million, $12 million, and $30 million were recognized in 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\n## 4. Segmental analysis\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the group's reportable segments were changed consistent with a change in the way that resources are allocated and performance is assessed from that date, by the chief operating decision maker, who for bp is the chief executive officer. From the first quarter of 2021, the group's reportable segments are gas & low carbon energy, oil production & operations, customers & products, and Rosneft. At 31 December 2020, the group's reportable segments were Upstream, Downstream and Rosneft.\n\nGas & low carbon energy comprises regions with upstream businesses that predominantly produce natural gas, gas marketing and trading activities and the group's solar, wind and hydrogen businesses. Gas producing regions were previously in the Upstream segment. The group's renewables businesses were previously part of 'Other businesses and corporate'.\n\nOil production & operations comprises regions with upstream activities that predominantly produce crude oil. These activities were previously in the Upstream segment.\n\nCustomers & products comprises the group's customer-focused businesses, spanning convenience and mobility, which includes fuels retail and nextgen offers such as electrification, as well as aviation, midstream, and Castrol lubricants. It also includes our oil products businesses, refining & trading. The petrochemicals business is reported in restated comparative information as part of the customers and products segment up to its sale in December 2020. The customers & products segment is, therefore, substantially unchanged from the former Downstream segment.\n\nThe Rosneft segment was unchanged and continues to include equity-accounted earnings from the group's investment in Rosneft. The group will cease to report Rosneft as a separate segment in the group's financial reporting for 2022. See Note 37 Events after the reporting period.\n\nOther businesses and corporate comprises the group's shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.\n\n2020 and 2019 have been restated in Notes 4 and 13 to reflect the changes in reportable segments. References to segments have also changed in Notes 2, 7, 15 and 27.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group's accounting policies described in Note 1. However, IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss before interest and tax inventory holding gains and losses a . Replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.\n\nSales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved. Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments. These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the group subsidiary which made the sale. The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of customers & products.\n\nAll surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are allocated to Other businesses and corporate. However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the operating segments based upon the business in which the employees work.\n\nCertain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for bp, and for the UK as this is bp's country of domicile.\n\n200\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested. Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons. The number of shares that are expected to vest each year under employee share plans are shown in the table below. The dilutive effect of the employee share plans at 31 December is also shown.\n\n208\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

Oil and gas properties CGUs were allocated to the new segments based on whether they predominantly produce oil or gas. No individual CGUs were split between the new segments and the existing CGUs remained unchanged. Legacy upstream goodwill was allocated to the two groups of CGUs allocated to the new segments based on the relative aggregate recoverable value of each group. An impairment test was performed on the goodwill balances allocated to the oil production & operations and the gas & low carbon energy segments at 1 January 2021 after the change in segments; no impairment of either goodwill balance was identified as a result thereof.\n\n|                                                   | $ million gas & low carbon energy   | $ million gas & low carbon energy   | $ million oil production & operations   | $ million oil production & operations   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                                   | 2021                                | 2020                                | 2021                                    | 2020                                    |\n| Goodwill                                          | 2,147                               | 2,152                               | 5,464                                   | 5,613                                   |\n| Excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount | 3,991                               | 3,991                               | 32,438                                  | 27,758                                  |\n\nThe table above shows the carrying amount of goodwill for the segments at the period end and the excess of the recoverable amount, based on a pretax value-in-use calculation, over the carrying amount (headroom) at the date of the most recent test.

        "page_content": "## 13. Goodwill and impairment review of goodwill - continued\n\nThe value in use for relevant CGUs in both gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each field, based on appropriately risked estimates of reserves and resources. Midstream and supply and trading activities and equity-accounted entities are generally not included in the impairment reviews of goodwill, as they do not represent part of the grouping of CGUs to which the goodwill balances relate and which are used to monitor the goodwill balances for internal management purposes. Where such activities form part of wider CGUs to which goodwill relates they are reflected in the test. As the production profile and related cash flows can be estimated from bp's past experience, management believes that the cash flows generated over the estimated life of field is the appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment in both gas & low carbon energy and oil & production operations. The estimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced. As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of each field are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by bp management.\n\nEstimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis, including operating and capital expenditure, are derived from the business segment plans. The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as part of bp's centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources.\n\nThe average production for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing in the gas & low carbon energy segment over the next 15 years is 261 mmboe per year (2020 275 mmboe per year) and in the oil production and operations segment is 604 mmboe per year (2020 602 mmboe per year). Production assumptions used for the goodwill impairment tests in both gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations reflect management's best estimate of future production of the existing portfolio at the time of the calculation. The group's expectation to reduce upstream hydrocarbon production by around 40% by 2030 from its 2019 baseline is expected to be achieved through future active management and high-grading of the portfolio. Changes in upstream production since 2019 will be included in the best estimates however as the specific future changes to the portfolio are not yet known, these best estimates do not include the full extent of the expected upstream production reductions .\n\nThe weighted average pre-tax discount rate used in the review for both segments is 11% (2020 11% for both segments).\n\nThe most recent reviews for impairment for the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments were carried out in the fourth quarter. As permitted by IAS 36, the detailed calculations for recoverable amounts performed in 2020 were used as a basis for the 2021 impairment tests. The recoverable amounts, key assumptions and sensitivity calculations for 2021 are prepared using the remaining future cash flows from the 2020 detailed calculations. The headrooms for 2021 do not represent the headrooms that would result if a test was run in either segment based on discounted future cash flows estimated using 2021 data and assumptions.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate. The value-in-use calculations have been prepared solely for the purposes of determining whether the goodwill balance were impaired. Estimated future cash flows were prepared on the basis of certain assumptions prevailing at the time of the tests. The actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions made. For example, reserves and resources estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change. Due to economic developments, regulatory change and emissions reduction activity arising from climate concern and other factors, future commodity prices and other assumptions may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.\n\nSensitivities to different variables have been estimated using certain simplifying assumptions. For example, lower oil and gas price or production sensitivities do not fully reflect the specific impacts for each contractual arrangement and will not capture all favourable impacts that may arise from cost deflation or savings. A detailed calculation in either segment at any given price or production profile may, therefore, produce a different result.\n\nAdverse changes in input assumptions applied in respect to assets carried at or close to their value in use, primarily being those assets previously impaired, would have a limited effect on goodwill headrooms, instead resulting in a direct impairment of the particular CGU's net book value. Conversely, a reduction in the value in use of those assets carried at a value below their respective values in use would result in an adverse impact on the relevant goodwill headroom. It is estimated that a 33% (2020 28%) reduction in revenue throughout each year of the remaining life of those assets, either as a result of adverse price or production conditions or a combination of each, would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of the oil production and operations segment. For gas & low carbon energy a 20% (2020 20%) reduction would have the same result.\n\nIt is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of either segment.\n\n## customers & products\n\n|          | $ million   | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|\n|          | Castrol     | US Fuels    | European  Fuels | Other       | Total       | Castrol     | US Fuels    | European  Fuels | Other       | Total       |\n| Goodwill | 2,837       | 606         | 862             | 392         | 4,697       | 2,865       | 606         | 913             | 276         | 4,660       |\n\nCash flows for each CGU are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of up to five years. To determine the value in use for each of the cash-generating units, cash flows for a period of 10 years are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value. It is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used in the US Fuels and European Fuels goodwill impairment assessments would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets.\n\n## Castrol\n\nAs permitted by IAS 36, the detailed calculations of Castrol's recoverable amount performed in the most recent detailed calculation in 2018 was used as the basis for the tests in 2021 as the criteria of IAS 36 were considered satisfied: the headroom was substantial in 2018; there have been no significant changes in the assets and liabilities; and the likelihood that the recoverable amount would be less than the carrying amount is remote.\n\nThe key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Castrol unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes, and discount rate. Operating margin and sales volumes assumptions used in the detailed impairment review of goodwill calculation are consistent with the assumptions used in the Castrol unit's business plan and values assigned to these key assumptions reflect past experience. A pre-tax discount rate of 9% is applied in the test. No reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would cause the unit's recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets. Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a nominal 2.8% growth rate.\n\n212\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

The balances are unsecured and will be settled in cash. There are no significant provisions for doubtful debts relating to these balances and no significant expense recognized in the income statement in respect of bad or doubtful debts. Dividends receivable are not included in the table above.\n\nThe majority of purchases from associates relate to crude oil and oil products transactions with Rosneft. Sales to associates are related to various entities.\n\nbp has commitments amounting to $9,930 million (2020 $10,777 million), primarily in relation to contracts with its associates for the purchase of transportation capacity. For information on capital commitments in relation to associates see Note 12.\n\nbp's share of impairment charges taken by associates in 2021 was $291 million (2020 $414 million).\n\n## 17.

The fair value is determined using an estimate of discounted future cash flows that are expected to be received and is considered a level 3 valuation under the fair value hierarchy. Future cash flows are estimated based on inputs including oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and operating costs related to the disposed operations. The discount rate used is based on a risk-free rate adjusted for asset-specific risks. The contingent consideration principally relates to the disposal of our Alaskan business.\n\n## 18.

The net credit to the income statement in the year in respect of inventory net realizable value provisions was $153 million (2020 $17 million credit), of which $151 million credit (2020 $71 million credit) related to hydrocarbon inventories.\n\nAs a result of the changes in strategic direction of the group and the evolution of the trading strategy set out in Note 1, from 1 January 2021, certain inventory, totalling $11.4 billion as at 31 December 2021, is now treated as trading inventory and is valued at fair value whereas the equivalent inventory was previously valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value in prior periods. Trading inventories are valued using quoted benchmark prices adjusted as appropriate for location and quality differentials. They are predominantly categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n217",

Whilst credit risk has decreased since 31 December 2020, there has also been a significant increase in the group's trade and other receivables balance. Therefore, the total expected credit loss allowances recognized as at 31 December 2021 have not significantly changed during the year.\n\nValuation and qualifying accounts relating to fixed asset investments comprise impairment provisions for investments in equity-accounted entities.\n\nValuation and qualifying accounts are deducted in the balance sheet from the assets to which they apply.

The environmental provision includes provisions for costs related to the control, abatement, clean-up or elimination of environmental pollution relating to soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment contamination. The litigation and claims category includes provisions for matters related to, for example, commercial disputes, product liability, and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances. Emissions provisions primarily relate to obligations under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard Program and are driven by the amount of the obligations outstanding and current price of the related credits. The provision will principally be settled through allowances already held as inventory in the group balance sheet.\n\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to provisions, see Provisions and contingencies within Note 1.\n\n## Gulf of Mexico oil spill\n\nThe group has recognized certain assets, payables and provisions and incurs certain residual costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that occurred in 2010. For further information see Notes 6, 8, 19, 21, 28, 32. The litigation and claims provision presented in the table above includes the latest estimate for the remaining costs associated with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The amounts payable may differ from the amount provided and the timing of payments is uncertain.\n\n## 23. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nMost group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans (money purchase schemes) or defined benefit plans (final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension benefit payments). For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee. For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employee's pensionable salary and length of service. Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.\n\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-retirement benefits in Note 1.\n\nThe pension obligation in the UK consists primarily of a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, one independent director and one independent chairman nominated by the company. The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. This plan was closed to new joiners in 2010 and was closed to future accrual on 30 June 2021 resulting in a curtailment gain of $0.3 billion being recognized in\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n219",

For active members of the plan at 30 June 2021, benefit payables are now linked to salary as at that date, rather than salary on retirement. Employees in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nIn the US, all pension benefits now accrue under a cash balance formula. Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected. Retiring US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement. The plan is funded and its assets are overseen by a fiduciary Investment Committee. During 2021 the committee was composed of seven bp employees appointed by the president of bp Corporation North America Inc. (the appointing officer). The Investment Committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan. US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution (401k) plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.\n\nIn the US, group companies also provide post-retirement healthcare to eligible retired employees and their dependants (and, in certain legacy cases, life insurance coverage); the entitlement to these benefits is based on the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion of a minimum period of service.\n\nIn the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries. In Germany and France, the majority of the pensions are unfunded. In Germany, the group's largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core pension through salary sacrifice. For employees who joined since 2002, the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on such factors as an employee's pensionable salary and length of service. The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and employees are based on the interest rate which is set out in German tax law. Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of an annuity. The German plans are governed by legal agreements between bp and the works council or between bp and the trade union.\n\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. During 2021 the aggregate level of contributions was $274 million (2020 $325 million and 2019 $349 million). The aggregate level of contributions in 2022 is expected to be approximately $200 million, and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.\n\nFor the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of contributions is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2023 formal actuarial valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2021. The closure of the defined benefit plan to future accrual and the consequent lower service cost reduces the plan's expected future funding volatility.\n\nThe surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.\n\nMinimum pension funding in the US is determined by legislation and is supplemented by discretionary contributions. No contributions were made into the primary US pension plan in 2021 and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.\n\nThe surplus relating to the primary US fund is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that economic benefit can be gained from the surplus through a reduction in future contributions.\n\nThere was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2021. The UK plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years; valuations are required more frequently in many other countries.The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31 December 2020. A valuation of the US plan and largest Eurozone plans are carried out annually.\n\nThe material financial assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below.

In other countries, including the Eurozone, we use this approach, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information available. The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.\n\n220\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. bp's most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows:\n\n| Mortality assumptions                                     | Years   | Years   | UK   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Years    | Years    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|\n|                                                           |         |         |      | US      | US      | US      | US      | Eurozone | Eurozone |\n|                                                           | 2021    | 2020    | 2019 | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    | 2021    | 2020     | 2019     |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently  aged 60   | 26.9    | 26.9    | 27.3 | 24.9    | 24.7    | 24.9    | 25.8    | 25.7     | 25.7     |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently  aged 40   | 28.4    | 28.4    | 28.9 | 26.6    | 26.4    | 26.7    | 28.3    | 28.2     | 28.3     |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently  aged 60 | 28.9    | 28.8    | 28.7 | 27.9    | 27.7    | 28.0    | 29.1    | 29.0     | 29.1     |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently  aged 40 | 30.5    | 30.4    | 30.5 | 29.4    | 29.2    | 29.7    | 31.2    | 31.2     | 31.2     |\n\nPension plan assets are generally held in trusts, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans. The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\n\nA significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.\n\nThe trustee's long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.\n\nFor the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets with liability matching characteristics over time primarily by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds. This agreement is not impacted by the closure of the plan to future accrual. There is a similar agreement in place for the primary US plan. During 2021, the UK and the US plans switched 5% and 13% of plan assets respectively from equities to bonds (2020 11% and nil% respectively).\n\nThe current asset allocation policy for the major plans at 31 December 2021 was as follows:\n\n|                                         | UK   | US   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Asset category                          | %    | %    |\n| Total equity (including private equity) | 12   | 27   |\n| Bonds/cash (including LDI)              | 81   | 73   |\n| Property/real estate                    | 7    | -    |\n\nThe amounts invested under the LDI programme by the primary UK pension plan as at 31 December 2021 were $7,399 million (2020 $4,217 million) of government-issued nominal bonds and $24,516 million (2020 $24,576 million) of index-linked bonds.\n\nSome of the group's pension plans in the Eurozone and other countries use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix to manage the level of risk. The fair value of these instruments is included in other assets in the table below.\n\nThe group's main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property/real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.\n\nThe fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are presented in the table below, including the effects of derivative financial instruments. Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 223.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n221",

Settlements in the US are the result of a buy-out transaction for the pensions of a group of low value annuitants.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe discount rate, inflation and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one-percentage point change, in isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31 December 2021 for the group's pensions and other post-retirement benefit expense would have had the effects shown in the tables below. The effects shown for the expense in 2022 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.\n\n|                                          | $ million   | $ million        | $ million   | $ million   | $ million                     | $ million                     |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | UK          | UK               | US          | US          | One percentage point Eurozone | One percentage point Eurozone |\n|                                          | Increase    | Decrease         | Increase    | Decrease    | Increase                      | Decrease                      |\n| Discount rate a                          |             |                  |             |             |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2022                | (248)       | 159              | (57)        | 50          | (3)                           | (6)                           |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2021 | (5,143)     | 6,788            | (951)       | 1,171       | (980)                         | 1,238                         |\n| Inflation rate b                         |             |                  |             |             |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2022                | 74          | (71)             | 10          | (8)         | 32                            | (26)                          |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2021 |             | 4,062    (3,912) | 60          | (51)        | 880                           | (748)                         |\n\n- a The amounts presented reflect that the discount rate is used to determine the asset interest income as well as the interest cost on the obligation.\n- b The amounts presented reflect the total impact of an inflation rate change on the assumptions for rate of increase in salaries, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.\n\n|                                          | $ million One year increase   | $ million One year increase   | $ million One year increase   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | UK                            | US                            | Eurozone                      |\n| Longevity                                |                               |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2022                | 25                            | 4                             | 7                             |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2021 | 1,402                         | 119                           | 291                           |\n\n## Estimated future benefit payments and the weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations\n\nThe expected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, but exclude plan expenses, up until 2031 and the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2021 are as follows:\n\n| Estimated future benefit payments   | UK    | US    | Eurozone   | Other   | $ million Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|-------|------------|---------|-------------------|\n| 2022                                | 1,100 | 683   | 328        | 97      | 2,208             |\n| 2023                                | 1,141 | 546   | 319        | 91      | 2,097             |\n| 2024                                | 1,163 | 529   | 312        | 92      | 2,096             |\n| 2025                                | 1,164 | 527   | 312        | 92      | 2,095             |\n| 2026                                | 1,185 | 523   | 299        | 93      | 2,100             |\n| 2027-2031                           | 6,184 | 2,501 | 1,397      | 476     | 10,558            |\n| Weighted average duration           |       |       |            |         | Years             |\n|                                     | 17.9  | 12.7  | 15.9       | 12.5    |                   |\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n225",

The fair values of the significant majority of the group's long-term borrowings are determined using quoted prices in active markets, and so fall within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Where quoted prices are not available, quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets are used and such measurements are therefore categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n|                       |            | 2021            |            | $ million 2020   |\n|-----------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|------------------|\n|                       | Fair value | Carrying amount | Fair value | Carrying amount  |\n| Short-term borrowings | 2,191      | 2,191           | 1,237      | 1,237            |\n| Long-term borrowings  | 60,755     | 58,985          | 74,855     | 71,427           |\n| Total finance debt    | 62,946     | 61,176          | 76,092     | 72,664           |\n\n226\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

We maintain our financial framework to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders, while ensuring a secure financial base.\n\nThe group monitors capital on basis of gearing, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity. Net debt is calculated as finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt and gearing are non-GAAP measures. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings 'Derivative financial instruments'. All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, gearing was 25.3% (2020 31.3%).\n\n| At 31 December                                                         | 2021   | $ million 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Finance debt                                                           | 61,176 | 72,664           |\n| Less: fair value asset (liability) of hedges related to finance debt a | (118)  | 2,612            |\n|                                                                        | 61,294 | 70,052           |\n| Less: cash and cash equivalents                                        | 30,681 | 31,111           |\n| Net debt                                                               | 30,613 | 38,941           |\n| Total equity                                                           | 90,439 | 85,568           |\n| Gearing                                                                | 25.3 % | 31.3 %           |\n\nAn analysis of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities is provided below.\n\n|                                                     | $ million    | $ million         | $ million         | $ million                                                                      | $ million                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | Finance debt | Currency  swaps a | Lease liabilities | Net partner  payable for  leases entered  into on behalf  of joint  operations | Total liabilities  arising from  financing  activities |\n| At 1 January 2021                                   | 72,664       | (2,965)           | 9,262             | 267                                                                            | 79,228                                                 |\n| Exchange adjustments                                | (185)        | -

This primarily includes drilling rigs in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments and retail service stations, oil depots and storage tanks in the customer & products segment as well as office accommodation and vessel charters across the group. The weighted-average remaining lease term for the total lease portfolio is around 8 years (2020 8 years). Some leases have payments that vary with market interest or inflation rates. Certain leases contain residual value guarantees, which may be triggered in certain circumstances such as if market values have significantly declined at the conclusion of the lease.\n\nThe table below shows the timing of the undiscounted cash outflows for the lease liabilities included on the balance sheet.\n\n|                                              | $ million   | $ million   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                              | 2021        | 2020        |\n| Undiscounted lease liability cash flows due: |             |             |\n| Within 1 year                                | 1,949       | 2,262       |\n| 1 to 2 years                                 | 1,631       | 1,672       |\n| 2 to 3 years                                 | 1,207       | 1,340       |\n| 3 to 4 years                                 | 1,005       | 1,025       |\n| 4 to 5 years                                 | 682         | 878         |\n| 5 to 10 years                                | 2,089       | 2,192       |\n| Over 10 years                                | 1,462       | 1,515       |\n|                                              | 10,025      | 10,884      |\n| Impact of discounting                        | (1,414)     | (1,622)     |\n| Lease liabilities at 31 December             | 8,611       | 9,262       |\n| Of which - current                           | 1,747       | 1,933       |\n| - non-current                                | 6,864       | 7,329       |\n\nThe group may enter into lease arrangements a number of years before taking control of the underlying asset due to construction lead times or to secure future operational requirements.

For all other financial instruments within the scope of IFRS 9, the carrying amount is either the fair value, or approximates the fair value.\n\nInformation on gains and losses on derivative financial assets and financial liabilities classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss is provided in the derivative gains and losses section of Note 29. Fair value gains and losses related to other assets and liabilities classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss totalled a net gain of $627 million (2020 net gain of $367 million). Dividend income of $11 million (2020 $17 million) from investments in equity instruments classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss is presented within other income - see Note 6.\n\nInterest income and expenses arising on financial instruments are disclosed in Note 6.\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nThe group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including market risks relating to commodity prices; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; credit risk; and liquidity risk.\n\nThe group financial risk committee (GFRC) advises the chief financial officer (CFO) who oversees the management of these risks. The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the EVP trading and shipping and SVPs treasury, tax, accounting reporting control and planning & performance management. The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group. The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the chief executive officer (CEO), and via the CEO to the board, that the group's financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with group policies and group risk appetite.\n\nThe group's trading activities in the oil, natural gas, LNG and power markets are managed within the trading and shipping business. Treasury holds foreign exchange and interest-rate products in the financial markets to hedge group exposures related to debt and hybrid bond issuance; the compliance, control and risk management processes for these activities are managed within the treasury business. All other foreign exchange and interest rate activities within financial markets are performed within the trading and shipping business and are also underpinned by the compliance, control and risk management infrastructure common to the activities of bp's trading and shipping business. All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. These teams are subject to close financial and management control.\n\nThe trading and shipping business maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk, credit risk and operational risk associated with trading activity. A policy and risk committee approves value-at-risk delegations, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, methodologies and procedures. A commitments committee approves the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.\n\nIn addition, the trading and shipping business undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a control framework as described more fully below.\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business. The primary commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the group's financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The group enters into derivatives in a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation. In addition, the group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its natural business exposures. In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.\n\nThe major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed below.\n\n## (i) Commodity price risk\n\nThe group's trading and shipping business is responsible for delivering value across the overall crude, oil products, gas, LNG and power supply chains. As such, it routinely enters into spot and term physical commodity contracts in addition to optimising physical storage, pipeline and transportation capacity. These activities expose the group to commodity price risk which is managed by entering into oil and natural gas and power swaps, options and futures.\n\nThe group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions in liquid periods using value-at-risk techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation models. These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a oneday holding period within a 95% confidence level. Trading activity occurring in liquid periods is subject to value-at-risk and other limits for each trading activity and the aggregate of all trading activity. The calculation of potential changes in value within the liquid period considers positions, historical price movements and the correlation of these price movements. Models are regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n229",

The value-at-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing and scenario analysis through simulating the financial impact of certain physical, economic and geo-political scenarios. The value-at-risk measure in respect of the aggregated trading positions in liquid periods at 31 December 2021 was $100 million (2020 $40 million) whereas the average value-at-risk measure for the period was $64 million (2020 $56 million). This measure incorporates the effect of diversification reflecting the offsetting risks across the trading portfolio. Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures which are outside of liquid periods and for which value-at-risk techniques are not appropriate.\n\n## (ii) Foreign currency exchange risk\n\nSince bp has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the group's reported results and future expenditure commitments. The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions. For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the group's reported results. The main underlying economic currency of the group's cash flows is the US dollar. This is because bp's major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars. bp's foreign currency exchange management policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar. The group coordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible and then managing any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.\n\nMost of the group's borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar. At 31 December 2021, the total foreign currency borrowings not swapped into US dollars amounted to $211 million (2020 $321 million). The group also has in issue perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds in euro, sterling and US dollars. Whilst the contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, the group has chosen to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods.\n\nThe group manages the net residual foreign currency exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million. At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit. A continuous assessment is made in respect of the group's foreign currency exposures to capture hedging requirements.\n\nDuring the year, hedge accounting was applied to foreign currency exposure to highly probable forecast capital expenditure commitments. The group fixes the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards for the highly probable forecast capital expenditure. At 31 December 2021 the most significant open contracts in place were for $55 million sterling (2020 $124 million sterling).\n\nWhere the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-atrisk techniques as explained in (i) commodity price risk above.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nbp is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt. While the group issues debt and hybrid bonds in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the economic exposure to a floating rate basis, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt. The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2021 was 41% of total finance debt outstanding (2020 45%). The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2021 was 3% (2020 3%) and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt was twelve years (2020 eight years).\n\nThe group's earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the element of the group's finance debt that has been swapped to floating rates. If the interest rates applicable to these floating rate instruments were to have changed by one percentage point on 1 January 2022, it is estimated that the group's finance costs for 2022 would change by approximately $251 million (2020 $330 million).\n\nbp is exposed to benchmark interest rate components; primarily 3 month USD LIBOR. From 31 December 2021 some USD LIBOR tenors, and all EUR, GBP and CHF LIBOR tenors ceased to be published. The remaining USD LIBOR tenors, including 3 month USD LIBOR, will continue to be published until June 2023 .\n\nIn October 2020 the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) published its fallback protocol containing clauses to amend derivative contracts on the cessation of LIBOR should an entity and its counterparties adhere to the protocol. The protocol's pricing mechanism is at fair market value and bp has signed up to the protocol as this removes transition uncertainty for any interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts of the group. Market participants have been encouraged by regulators to switch to the new risk free rates to increase market activity and liquidity as they move away from LIBOR. bp continues to monitor regulatory and market developments over the course of the transition.\n\nDuring 2021, bp's internal working group for IBOR reform has continued to monitor market developments and manage transition to alternative benchmark rates. The working group has identified financial instruments that are linked to existing interest rate benchmarks, primarily, borrowings and derivative contracts. Financial instruments and relevant agreements exposed to EUR, GBP and CHF have transitioned to alternative benchmarks at 31 December 2021. As at 31 December 2021 finance debt with a carrying value of $2,062 million and derivatives with a nominal value of $24,088 million are exposed to USD LIBOR and are expected to transition to alternative benchmark rates. The derivatives comprise relevant derivative contracts hedging finance debt and hybrid bonds all of which are covered by the ISDA fallback protocol. For finance debt, negotiations with relevant counterparties are ongoing and transition is expected before the end of June 2023. Any derivatives not actively transitioned before the end of June 2023 will be transitioned through the ISDA protocol. New contracts are being executed based on the new risk free rates. The working group continues to implement the relevant IT and operational requirements needed. bp continues to participate in external committees and task forces dedicated to interest rate benchmark reform.\n\n## (b) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables. Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which the outstanding exposure incremental to that recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2021 was $1,407 million (2020 $1,405 million) in respect of liabilities of joint ventures and associates and $694 million (2020 $661 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. Maturity dates vary, and guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the obligation. In general, a payment under the guarantee contract would be triggered by failure of the guaranteed party to fulfil its obligation covered by the guarantee.\n\n230\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

        "page_content": "## 28. Financial instruments and financial risk factors - continued\n\nThe group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk. Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business. On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered. Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk; the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported; and the timely identification and reporting of any non-approved credit exposures and credit losses. While each segment is responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group policy, treasury holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions.\n\nFor the purposes of financial reporting the group calculates expected loss allowances based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the credit risk associated with the significant majority of financial assets measured at amortized cost is considered to be low. Since the tenor of substantially all of the group's in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses. Expected loss allowances for financial guarantee contracts are typically lower than their initial fair value less, where appropriate, amortization. Financial assets are considered to be credit-impaired when there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. This includes observable data concerning significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; a breach of contract; concession being granted to the counterparty for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty's financial difficulty, that would not otherwise be considered; it becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization or an active market for the financial asset disappearing because of financial difficulties. The group also applies a rebuttable presumption that an asset is credit-impaired when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof, for example where all legal avenues for collection of amounts due have been exhausted, the financial asset (or relevant portion) is written off.\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss after recovery if there is a default) and the exposure at default (i.e. the asset's carrying amount). The group allocates a credit risk rating to exposures based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss, including but not limited to external ratings. Probabilities of default derived from historical, current and future-looking market data are assigned by credit risk rating with a loss given default based on historical experience and relevant market and academic research applied by exposure type. Experienced credit judgement is applied to ensure probabilities of default are reflective of the credit risk associated with the group's exposures. Credit enhancements that would reduce the group's credit losses in the event of default are reflected in the calculation when they are considered integral to the related asset.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount. The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses. As at 31 December 2021, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate approximately $9.5 billion (2020 $5.4 billion) of credit risk of which approximately $7.5 billion (2020 $4.9 billion) related to assets in the scope of IFRS 9's impairment requirements. Credit enhancements include standby and documentary letters of credit, bank guarantees, insurance and liens which are typically taken out with financial institutions who have investment grade credit ratings, or are liens over assets held by the counterparty of the related receivables. Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the group's overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.\n\nManagement information used to monitor credit risk, which reflects the impact of credit enhancements, indicates that the risk profile of financial assets which are subject to review for impairment under IFRS 9 is as set out below.\n\n| As at 31 December   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| AAA to AA-          | 14 %   | 11 %   |\n| A+ to A-            | 46 %   | 59 %   |\n| BBB+ to BBB-        | 14 %   | 8   %  |\n| BB+ to BB-          | 8   %  | 6   %  |\n| B+ to B-            | 16 %   | 13 %   |\n| CCC+ and below      | 2   %  | 3   %  |\n\nMovements in the impairment provision for trade and other receivables are shown in Note 20.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n231",

The group's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function. Unless restricted by local regulations, generally subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to the treasury function, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries' requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the group's overall net currency positions.\n\nThe group benefits from open credit provided by suppliers who generally sell on five to 60-day payment terms in accordance with industry norms. bp utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow. This includes discounting of receivables and, in the supply and trading businesses, managing inventory, collateral and supplier payment terms within a maximum of 60 days.\n\nIt is normal practice in the oil and gas supply and trading business for customers and suppliers to utilize letter of credit (LC) facilities to mitigate credit and non-performance risk. Consequently, LCs facilitate active trading in a global market where credit and performance risk can be significant. In common with the industry, bp routinely provides LCs to some of its suppliers.\n\nThe group has committed LC facilities totalling $12,575 million (2020 $11,325 million), allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum 24-month duration. There were also uncommitted secured LC facilities in place at 31 December 2021 for $4,290 million (2020 $3,460 million), which are secured against inventories or receivables when utilized. The facilities are held with over 26 international banks. The uncommitted LC facilities can only be terminated by either party giving a stipulated termination notice to the other.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the supplier has the option to request accelerated payment from the LC provider in order to further reduce their exposure. bp's payments are made to the provider of the LC rather than the supplier according to the original contractual payment terms. At 31 December 2021, $9,154 million (2020 $5,250 million) of the group's trade payables subject to these arrangements were payable to LC providers, with no material exposure to any individual provider. If these facilities were not available, this could result in renegotiation of payment terms with suppliers such that settlement periods were shorter.\n\nStandard & Poor's Ratings long-term credit rating for bp is A- (stable) and Moody's Investors Service rating is A2 (stable) and the Fitch Ratings' longterm credit rating is A (stable).\n\nDuring 2021, $6 billion (2020 $14 billion) of long-term taxable bonds were issued with terms ranging from twenty to forty years. In addition the group issued perpetual hybrid bonds with a US dollar equivalent value of $0.9 billion (2020 $11.9 billion) . Commercial paper is issued at competitive rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.\n\nAs a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $30.7 billion at 31 December 2021 (2020 $31.1 billion), primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice. At 31 December 2021, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of an undrawn committed $8.0 billion (2020 $10.0 billion) credit facility and $4.0 billion (2020 $7.6 billion) of standby facilities. As at 31 December 2021 the credit facility and standby facilities were available for two and four years respectively. The facilities are with 27 international banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates. In February 2022 these facilities were extended for a further year.\n\nFor further information on the group's sources and uses of cash see Liquidity and capital resources on page 342.\n\nThe group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 29. Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows, other than noted below, that could be of a significantly different amount or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.\n\n232\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

As part of actively managing the group's debt portfolio it is possible that cash flows in relation to associated derivatives could be accelerated from the profile provided. The amounts reflect the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt or hybrid bonds. The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible. Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts (inflows) for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $27,048 million at 31 December 2021 (2020 $33,704 million) to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.\n\n| Cash outflows for derivative financial instruments at 31 December   | 2021   | $ million 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Within one year                                                     | 1,497  | 2,384            |\n| 1 to 2 years                                                        | 1,492  | 1,976            |\n| 2 to 3 years                                                        | 2,531  | 2,017            |\n| 3 to 4 years                                                        | 2,053  | 3,074            |\n| 4 to 5 years                                                        | 5,575  | 2,582            |\n| 5 to 10 years                                                       | 8,618  | 15,263           |\n| Over 10 years                                                       | 5,365  | 4,483            |\n|                                                                     | 27,131 | 31,779           |\n\nFor further information on our derivative financial instruments, see Note 29.\n\n## 29. Derivative financial instruments\n\nIn the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives. An outline of the group's financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 28. Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.\n\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.\n\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.\n\nExchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date. These derivatives are categorized within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Exchange traded derivatives are typically considered settled through the (normally daily) payment or receipt of variation margin.\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps, forwards and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nIn certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available. In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in management's best estimate of fair value. These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n233",

Derivative financial instruments - continued\n\nFinancial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors. The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is categorized within level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n|                               | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020       | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020       |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n|                               | Fair value asset | Fair value liability | Fair value asset | Fair value liability |\n| Derivatives held for trading  |                  |                      |                  |                      |\n| Currency derivatives          | 272              | (643)                | 858              | (694)                |\n| Oil price derivatives         | 2,192            | (1,567)              | 1,519            | (1,093)              |\n| Natural gas price derivatives | 6,823            | (8,273)              | 6,406            | (5,489)              |\n| Power price derivatives       | 3,105            | (2,966)              | 1,258            | (1,037)              |\n| Other derivatives             | 10               | -                    | 7                | -                    |\n|                               | 12,402           | (13,449)             | 10,048           | (8,313)              |\n| Embedded derivatives          |                  |                      |                  |                      |\n| Other embedded derivatives    | -                | (7)                  | 1                | (7)                  |\n|                               | -                | (7)                  | 1                | (7)                  |\n| Cash flow hedges              |                  |                      |                  |                      |\n| Currency forwards             | 1                | -                    | 4                | -                    |\n| Gas price futures             | -                | -                    | -                | -                    |\n|                               | 1                | -                    | 4                | -                    |\n| Fair value hedges             |                  |                      |                  |                      |\n| Currency swaps                | 326              | (465)                | 2,614            | (82)                 |\n| Interest rate swaps           | 21               | -                    | 80               | -                    |\n|                               | 347              | (465)                | 2,694            | (82)                 |\n|                               | 12,750           | (13,921)             | 12,747           | (8,402)              |\n| Of which - current            | 5,744            | (7,565)              | 2,992            | (2,998)              |\n| - non-current                 | 7,006            | (6,356)              | 9,755            | (5,404)              |\n\n## Derivatives held for trading\n\nThe group maintains active trading positions in a variety of derivatives. The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading. Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.

The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 28.\n\nThe following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.\n\nDerivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.\n\n|                               | $ million 2021   | $ million 2021   | $ million 2021   | $ million 2021   | $ million 2021   | $ million 2021   | $ million 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                               | Less than 1 year | 1-2 years        | 2-3 years        | 3-4 years        | 4-5 years        | Over 5 years     | Total            |\n| Currency derivatives          | 168              | 52               | 1                | 1                | -                | 50               | 272              |\n| Oil price derivatives         | 1,544            | 429              | 167              | 47               | 4                | 1                | 2,192            |\n| Natural gas price derivatives | 2,678            | 847              | 547              | 456              | 368              | 1,927            | 6,823            |\n| Power price derivatives       | 1,322            | 553              | 285              | 174              | 124              | 647              | 3,105            |\n| Other derivatives             | -                | 7                | -                | -                | -                | 3                | 10               |\n|                               | 5,712            | 1,888            | 1,000            | 678              | 496              | 2,628            | 12,402           |\n|                               |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  | $ million        |\n|                               |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  | Over 5 years     | 2020             |\n| Currency derivatives          | 153              | 9                | 3                | 2                | 2                | 689              | 858              |\n| Oil price derivatives         | 1,159            | 197              | 90               | 63               | 7                | 3                | 1,519            |\n| Natural gas price derivatives | 1,210            | 731              | 596              | 525              | 476              | 2,868            | 6,406            |\n| Power price derivatives       | 425              | 223              | 161              | 107              | 76               | 266              | 1,258            |\n| Other derivatives             | -                | -                | 7                | -                | -                | -                | 7                |\n|                               | 2,947            | 1,160            | 857              | 697              | 561              | 3,826            | 10,048           |\n\n234\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading. They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards. These gains and losses are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement. Also included within this line item are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes. The total amount relating to all these items was a net gain of $4,466 million. This number does not include gains and losses on the change in value of contracts which are not recognized under IFRS such as transportation and storage contracts, but does include the associated financially settled contracts. The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\n\nThe group also enters into derivative contracts relating to foreign currency risk management activities including contracts that the group has entered into to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The change in the unrealized value of these contracts was a net loss of $775 million (2020 $829 million net gain and 2019 $160 million net gain). Where the derivative is economically hedging finance debt, gains and losses on such derivative contracts are included within finance costs in 2021 and in production and manufacturing expenses in previous periods. Where the derivative is managing non-US hybrid bond exposure gains and loss are included within production and manufacturing expenses. Where these gains and losses arise on derivatives hedging finance debt they are largely offset by opposing net foreign exchange differences on retranslation of the associated non-US dollar debt. The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\n## (i) Foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast capital expenditure\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the group held currency forwards designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of highly probable forecast non-US dollar capital expenditure. Note 28 outlines the group's approach to foreign currency exchange risk management. When the highly probable forecast capital expenditure designated as a hedged item occurs, a non-financial asset is recognized and is presented within the fixed asset section of the balance sheet.\n\nThe group claims hedge accounting only for the spot value of the currency exposure in line with the strategy to fix the volatility in the spot exchange rate element. The fair value on the instrument attributable to forward points and foreign currency basis spreads is taken immediately to the income statement.\n\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group enters into hedging derivatives that match the currency and notional of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional designated on the forecast transaction. The group determines the extent to which it hedges highly probable forecast capital expenditures on a project by project basis.\n\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\n- \u00b7 counterparty's credit risk, the group mitigates counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with high credit quality counterparties; and\n\n236\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

The latter impacts the discount factor used in the calculation of the hedge ineffectiveness. The group mitigates differences in timing between the derivatives and hedged items by applying a rolling strategy and by hedging currency pairs from stable economies. The group's cash flow hedge designations are highly effective as the sources of ineffectiveness identified are expected to result in minimal hedge ineffectiveness.\n\nThe group has not designated any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk.\n\n## (ii) Commodity price risk of highly probable forecast sales\n\nDuring the period the group held Henry Hub NYMEX futures designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of certain highly probable forecast future sales. Henry Hub NYMEX futures are subject to daily settlement, where their fair value at the end of each day is required to be cash settled, such that the carrying amount of these hedging instruments within continuing hedge relationships is always zero at the end of each day.\n\nThe group is exposed to the variability in the gas price, but only applied hedge accounting to the risk of Henry Hub price movements for a percentage of future gas sales from its BPX Energy business.\n\nThe group applied hedge accounting in relation to these highly probable future sales where there was an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship was determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group entered into hedging derivatives that matched the notional amounts of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio was determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount designated on the forecast transaction.\n\nThe hedge was highly effective due to the price index of the hedging instruments matching the price index of the hedged item. The group did not designate any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of commodity price risk.\n\nThe tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.\n\n|                                              | Change in fair  value of  hedging  instrument  used to  calculate  ineffectiveness   | Change in fair  value of  hedged item  used to  calculate  ineffectiveness   | Hedge  ineffectiveness  recognized in  profit or (loss)   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2021                          |                                                                                      |                                                                              |                                                           |\n| Cash flow hedges                             |                                                                                      |                                                                              |                                                           |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        |                                                                                      |                                                                              |                                                           |\n| Highly probable forecast capital expenditure | (1)                                                                                  | 1                                                                            | -

Note 28 outlines the group's approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management. The interest rate swaps are used to convert US dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone denominated fixed rate borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt. The group manages all risks derived from debt issuance, such as credit risk, however, the group applies hedge accounting only to certain components of interest rate and foreign currency risk in order to minimize hedge ineffectiveness. The interest rate and foreign currency exposures are identified and hedged on an instrument-by-instrument basis. For interest rate exposures, the group designates as a fair value hedge the benchmark interest rate component only. This is an observable and reliably measurable component of interest rate risk.\n\nAll of the fair value hedge accounting relationships currently in place are directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. The group's swaps which reference interest rates are primarily exposed to 3 month USD LIBOR. For all of the swaps that reference Inter-Bank Offered Rates (IBORs), ISDA fallback clauses to amend derivatives on the cessation of LIBOR are already available as bp and its counterparties have adhered to the protocol. The nominal amounts of the applicable hedging instruments represent the extent of the risk exposure bp manages for financial derivatives designated in fair value hedge relationships that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. These are disclosed in the table below. The interest rate benchmark reform does not change the risk management strategy for fair value hedges.\n\nUncertainty around the method and timing of transition from IBORs to alternative risk-free rates (RfRs) may impact the assessment of whether hedge accounting can be applied to certain hedging relationships. However, the temporary reliefs provided by IFRS 9 allow bp to assume that in the event that significant uncertainty around the reform arises:\n\n- \u00b7 the interest rate benchmark component of fair value hedges only needs to be assessed as separately identifiable at initial designation; and\n- \u00b7 the interest rate benchmark is not altered for the purposes of assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument for fair value hedges.\n\nThe reliefs above will continue to apply until the uncertainty arising from the interest benchmark reform with respect to the timing and amount of the underlying cash flows to which the group is exposed ends. The group expects this uncertainty to continue until either the ISDA fallback clauses are activated in June 2023 or the contracts that reference IBORs are modified replacing the IBOR benchmark rate with a risk free rate. The group's assumption is that any modifications to swaps will meet the 'economically equivalent' criteria with contractual changes restricted to only those changes necessary to replace the benchmark rate with a risk free rate.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 the reliefs apply and bp continues to monitor regulatory and market developments as it manages the contractual transition.\n\nFor foreign currency exposures, the group excludes from the designation the foreign currency basis spread component implicit in the cross-currency interest rate swaps. This is separately calculated at hedge designation, is recognized in other comprehensive income over the life of the hedge and amortized to the income statement on a straight-line basis, in accordance with the group's policy on costs of hedging.\n\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively assessed using linear regression analysis. The group issues fixed rate debt and enters into interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps with critical terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt. Both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are expected to be held to maturity.\n\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\n- \u00b7 derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is mitigated by entering into derivative transactions only with high credit quality counterparties; and\n- \u00b7 sensitivity to interest rate between the hedged item and the derivatives. This is driven by differences in payment frequencies between the instrument and the bond.\n\n238\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

        "page_content": "## 31. Capital and reserves - continued\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.\n\n## Share premium account\n\nThe balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nThe balance on the merger reserve represents the fair value of the consideration given in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and bp's US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the group and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the group.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are reclassified to the income statement. It includes approximately $11 billion loss relating to the investment in Rosneft which is now expected to be reclassified to the income statement in 2022. See Note 37 Events after the reporting period.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThis reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge. It includes $651 million relating to the acquisition of an 18.5% interest in Rosneft in 2013 which is now expected to be reclassified to the income statement in 2022. See Note 37 Events after the reporting period. For further information on the accounting for cash flow hedges see Note 1 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Costs of hedging\n\nThis reserve records the change in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments to which cost of hedge accounting has been applied. The accumulated amount relates to time-period related hedged items and is amortized to profit or loss over the term of the hedging relationship. For further information on the accounting for costs of hedging see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Profit and loss account\n\nThe balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the group.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within noncontrolling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds issued by BP Capital Markets PLC, a group subsidiary, on 17 June 2020 in euro, sterling and US dollars for a US dollar equivalent amount of $11.9 billion. The hybrid bonds include redemption options exercisable at the group's discretion from June 2025 to March 2030 (the first 'call date'), on specified dates thereafter, or in the event of specific circumstances (such as a change in IFRS or tax regime) as set out in the individual terms of each issue. Coupons are fixed for an initial period up to dates from September 2025 to June 2030 at rates of 3.25% to 4.875% and reset to rates determined by the contractual terms of each instrument on certain dates thereafter. The contractual terms of the hybrid bonds allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, however their terms and conditions stipulate that any deferred payments must be made in the event of an announcement of an ordinary share or parity equity dividend distribution or certain share repurchases or redemptions. Payments made to and profit attributed to these hybrid bond holders in the year totalled $499 million (2020 $89 million) and $497 million (2020 $256 million) respectively. The accumulated non-controlling interest at the end of the year was $12,081 million (2020 $12,076 million).\n\nNon-controlling interests also includes perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued during 2021 by a group subsidiary, of $950 million. The proceeds from this issuance were specifically earmarked to fund the forward purchase and leaseback of an under-construction floating, production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) to be used on one of the group's major projects. The contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer interest payments and repayment of principle indefinitely however their terms and conditions stipulate that the group must purchase them on the occurrence of certain events, all within the group's control, including the declaration or payment of a BP p.l.c. distribution after mid-May 2026. The accumulated noncontrolling interest at the end of the year was $960 million, including $10 million of profit attributable to holders.\n\nAs the group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset in relation to these hybrid bonds and securities, they are classified as equity instruments and reported within non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n246\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThere were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2021 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the group's business. No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. Further information on financial guarantees is included in Note 28.\n\nIn the normal course of the group's business, bp group entities are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of current and past operations, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premises-liability claims, consumer protection, general health, safety, climate change and environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint, asbestos and other chemicals. The amounts claimed could be significant and could be material to the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp expects that the impact of current legal and regulatory proceedings on the group's results of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material.\n\nThe group files tax returns in many jurisdictions across the world. Various tax authorities are currently examining these returns, which contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. The resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax authorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete and the amounts could be significant and could, in aggregate, be material to the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp does not expect there to be any material impact upon the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n247",

        "page_content": "## 32. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings - continued\n\nThe group is subject to numerous national and local health, safety and environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities. These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil fields, commodities extraction sites, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites. In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed facilities. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its costs are inherently difficult to estimate. However, the estimated cost of environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the group's accounting policies. While the amounts of future possible costs that are not provided for could be significant and material to the group's results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not possible to estimate the amounts involved. bp does not expect these costs to have a material impact on the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\nIf production and manufacturing facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning obligations it is possible that, in certain circumstances, bp could be partially or wholly responsible for decommissioning. The group estimates that for production facilities, approximately $13 billion of associated decommissioning obligations were previously transferred to third parties. While the amounts associated with decommissioning provisions reverting to the group could be material, bp is not currently aware of any such material cases that have a greater than remote chance of reverting to the group. In one current case the owner of facilities has agreed to relinquish all of its assets to the U.S. government upon liquidation to resolve the outstanding liability. It is considered possible that certain decommissioning costs associated with some of these facilities in relation to assets previously disposed may in the future revert to bp; however, no provision has been recognized as no present obligation exists at the balance sheet date. Should the obligation revert, it is not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial position. Furthermore, as described in Provisions and contingencies within Note 1, decommissioning provisions associated with customers & products facilities are not generally recognized as the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates.\n\nBy their nature, it is not practicable to estimate the potential financial impact or possible timing of the above contingencies as there are significant uncertainties that are dependent on various factors that are not within the group's control.\n\n## Contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill\n\nFor information on legal proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, see Legal proceedings below. Any outstanding Deepwater Horizon related claims are not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial performance.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\n## Proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill\n\n## Introduction\n\nBP Exploration & Production Inc. (BPXP) was lease operator of Mississippi Canyon, Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico, where the semi-submersible rig Deepwater Horizon was deployed at the time of the 20 April 2010 explosion and fire and resulting oil spill (the Incident). Lawsuits and claims arising from the Incident were brought principally in US federal and state courts. The remaining proceedings arising from the Incident are discussed below.\n\n## Economic and Property Damages Settlement\n\nFollowing orders issued by United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on 22 January 2021, the claims administrator pursuant to the settlement programme which was established by the Economic and Property Damages Settlement has completed post-closure administrative wind down activities and the administration website has been closed.\n\n## Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement\n\nIn 2012 the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement (Medical Settlement) was entered into with the plaintiffs steering committee. It involves payments to qualifying class members based on a matrix for certain Specified Physical Conditions (SPCs), as well as a 21-year Periodic Medical Consultation Program (PMCP) for qualifying class members. All SPC claims have been determined by the medical claims administrator. In total, 27,603 claims (comprising 22,833 SPC claims and 4,770 PMCP claims) have been approved for compensation totalling approximately $67 million and 9,624 claims have been denied.\n\nThe Medical Settlement also includes an exclusive remedy provision regarding class members pursuing exposure-based personal injury claims for later-manifested physical conditions (LMPCs). In order to seek compensation from bp for an LMPC, class members must file a notice with the medical claims administrator within four years after the date of first diagnosis of the LMPC. As of 31 December 2021, there were 199 pending lawsuits brought by class members claiming LMPCs.\n\n## Other civil complaints - economic loss\n\nAll but one of the economic loss and property damage claims from individuals and businesses that either opted out of the EPD Settlement and/or were excluded from that settlement have been settled or dismissed.\n\nOne appeal remains pending before the Fifth Circuit by a plaintiff whose economic loss claims were dismissed by an August 2021 order from the federal district court in New Orleans that granted bp's motion for summary judgment.\n\n## Other civil complaints - personal injury\n\nThe vast majority of post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury claims from individuals that either opted out of the Medical Settlement and/or were excluded from that settlement have been dismissed.\n\nIn early April 2021, the federal district court in New Orleans severed nearly all of the remaining post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury cases from the consolidated multi-district proceedings. Of those severed cases, 19 are pending before other federal courts in Gulf Coast States, and the remaining 777 cases have been re-allotted among the judges of the federal district court in the Eastern District of Louisiana. 9 post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury cases will remain in the consolidated multi-district proceedings until plaintiffs have complied with the court's pre-trial orders, after which they will be severed from the consolidated multi-district proceedings.\n\n248\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

        "page_content": "## 32. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings - continued\n\n## Non-US government lawsuits\n\nOn 18 October 2012, a group of Mexican fishermen filed a class action complaint in a Mexican Federal District Court located in Mexico City against BP America Production Company (BPAPC) and other bp subsidiaries, seeking to recover for alleged environmental and economic harm in Mexico as a result of the Incident. On 27 June 2018, bp answered the complaint by seeking dismissal on various grounds including that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there was no economic or environmental harm in Mexico. There has been no subsequent material development in these proceedings.\n\nOn 3 December 2015 and 29 March 2016, Acciones Colectivas de Sinaloa (ACS) filed two class actions (which have since been consolidated) in a Mexican Federal District Court on behalf of any person or entity harmed by the Incident, including several coastal Mexican states and municipalities against BPXP, BPAPC, and other purported bp subsidiaries. In these class actions, plaintiffs seek an order requiring the bp defendants to repair the damage to the Gulf of Mexico, to pay penalties, and to compensate plaintiffs for damage to property, to health and for economic loss. BPXP and BPAPC opposed class certification and sought dismissal, principally on the basis that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there was no economic or environmental harm in Mexico. The court certified the class on 25 September 2019 and bp appealed that decision including by way of constitutional challenge. That challenge was denied on 8 October 2020 and on 18 January 2021, bp's appeal of that ruling was also denied. On 27 December 2019, the court issued an order on class notification procedures. On 2 January 2020, ACS moved for reconsideration of the order on class notification procedures, which was denied on 26 October 2021. On 22 November 2021, ACS filed a constitutional challenge to the notice ruling. A decision on the constitutional challenge is pending.\n\nThese legal actions remain at a relatively early stage and while it is not possible to predict the outcome, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.\n\n## Other legal proceedings\n\n## FERC and CFTC matters\n\nFollowing an investigation by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of several bp entities, the Administrative Law Judge of the FERC ruled on 13 August 2015 that bp manipulated the market by selling next-day, fixed price natural gas at Houston Ship Channel in 2008 in order to suppress the Gas Daily index and benefit its financial position. On 11 July 2016 the FERC issued an Order affirming the initial decision and directing bp to pay a civil penalty of $20.16 million and to disgorge $207,169 in unjust profits. On 10 August 2016, bp filed a request for rehearing with the FERC. On 17 December 2020, the FERC denied the rehearing request, sustaining the prior decision and ordering payment of the penalty and disgorgement amounts. bp has complied with the order but strongly disagrees with the FERC's decision and filed an appeal with the US Court of Appeals. Oral arguments were heard by the Fifth Circuit in early 2022 and a decision is expected later this year.\n\n## Lead paint matters\n\nSince 1987, Atlantic Richfield Company (Atlantic Richfield), a subsidiary \u00ab of bp, has been named as a co-defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in the US alleging injury to persons and property caused by lead pigment in paint. The majority of the lawsuits have been abandoned or dismissed against Atlantic Richfield. Atlantic Richfield is named in these lawsuits as alleged successor to International Smelting and Refining and another company that manufactured lead pigment during the period 1920-1946. The plaintiffs include individuals and governmental entities. Several of the lawsuits purport to be class actions. The lawsuits seek various remedies including compensation to lead-poisoned children, cost to find and remove lead paint from buildings, medical monitoring and screening programmes, public warning and education of lead hazards, reimbursement of government healthcare costs and special education for lead-poisoned citizens and punitive damages. No lawsuit against Atlantic Richfield has been settled nor has Atlantic Richfield been subject to a final adverse judgment in any proceeding. The amounts claimed and, if such suits were successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, Atlantic Richfield believes that it has valid defences. It intends to defend such actions vigorously and believes that the incurrence of liability is remote. Consequently, bp believes that the impact of these lawsuits on the group's results, financial position or liquidity will not be material.\n\n## Climate change\n\nBP p.l.c., BP America Inc. and BP Products North America Inc. are co-defendants with other oil and gas companies in multiple lawsuits brought in various state and federal courts on behalf of various governmental and private parties. The lawsuits generally assert claims under a variety of legal theories seeking to hold the defendant companies responsible for impacts allegedly caused by and/or relating to climate change. Underlying many of the legal theories are allegations regarding deceptive communication and disinformation to the public. The lawsuits seek remedies including payment of money and other forms of equitable relief. If such suits were successful, the cost of the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. All of these lawsuits remain at relatively early stages and while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.\n\n## Louisiana Coastal restoration\n\nSix coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed over 40 separate lawsuits in state courts in Louisiana against various oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion. bp entities are defendants in 17 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants' historical operations in oil fields within the Louisiana onshore coastal zone failed to comply with state permits and/or were conducted without the required coastal use permits. The plaintiffs seek unspecified statutory penalties and damages, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations.\n\nIn addition, four private landowners have filed separate claims in the state courts in Jefferson and Plaquemines Parishes of Louisiana for restoration damages related to alleged impacts to their marshlands associated with historic oil field operations. bp entities are defendants in two of these private landowner cases.\n\nAll of these lawsuits remain at relatively early stages and while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n249",

Events after the reporting period\n\nOn 27 February 2022, following the military action in Ukraine, bp announced that bp it will exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft) a Russian oil and gas company. As of 27 February 2022, bp chief executive officer Bernard Looney also stepped down from the board of Rosneft with immediate effect and has submitted a letter of resignation as did the other Rosneft director nominated by bp, former bp group chief executive Bob Dudley.\n\nAs a result of bp's nominated directors stepping down from the Rosneft board, bp has determined that as of 27 February 2022, the group no longer has significant influence over Rosneft taking into account the criteria set out in IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, bp will therefore no longer equity account for its interest in Rosneft as of that date, treating the investment prospectively as a financial asset measured at fair value within 'Other investments' until the shareholding is derecognized.\n\nAdditionally, in response to sanctions imposed on Russia by a number of countries, Russia has implemented new counter-sanctions including restrictions on the divestment from Russian assets by foreign investors and a reported temporary prohibition on registrars and depositories from making payments on Russian securities in favour of foreign investors. Further details including confirmation of the precise terms or application of these counter-sanctions are not yet known.\n\nThe discontinuation of equity accounting combined with the market impact on Russian assets that has arisen following the military action in Ukraine will have a material effect on the group's first quarter 2022 interim financial statements including on the carrying amount of bp's investment in Rosneft, which at 31 December 2021 stood at approximately $14 billion. In addition, foreign exchange losses and other cumulative charges to other comprehensive income will be taken to the income statement. At 31 December 2021, these amounts stood at approximately $11 billion. The change in accounting treatment also means that bp will no longer recognize a share in Rosneft's net income, production and reserves from 27 February 2022. The group will cease to report Rosneft as a separate segment in the group's financial reporting for 2022.\n\nAlso, as of 27 February 2022, bp decided to exit its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, the carrying value of which stood at $1.4 billion at 31 December 2021. The associated impacts will also be reflected in the group's first quarter 2022 interim financial statements.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n253",

The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\n- (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:\n- (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any; and\n- (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.\n- (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.\n- (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.\n- (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:\n- (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favourable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed programme in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based; and\n- (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.\n- (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.\n\n## Undeveloped oil and gas reserves\n\nUndeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\n- (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.\n- (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.\n- (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.\n\n## Developed oil and gas reserves\n\nDeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:\n\n- (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and\n- (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.\n\nFor details on bp's proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes, see pages 348-353.\n\n254\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021",

This information is prepared in compliance with FASB Oil and Gas Disclosures requirements.\n\nFuture net cash flows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized. These include the timing of future production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of average crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates from the previous 12 months. Furthermore, both proved reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change. bp cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of the assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.\n\n|                                                               | Europe   | Europe         | North  America                          | North  America        | South  America   | Africa   | Asia        | Asia                      | Australasia Total               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                                               | UK       | Rest of Europe | US                                      | Rest of North America |                  |          | Russia      | Rest of Asia              |                                 |\n| At 31 December                                                |          |                |                                         |                       |                  |          |             |                           |                                 |\n| Subsidiaries                                                  |          |                |                                         |                       |                  |          |             |                           |                                 |\n| Future cash inflows a                                         | 25,600   |                | -

A 'gross' well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of 'net' wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres. Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves; while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.\n\n|                                                                    |                                                                    | Europe                                                             | Europe                                                             | North  America                                                     | North  America                                                     | South  America                                                     | Africa                                                             | Asia                                                               |                                                                    | Australasia                                                        | Total b                                                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                    |                                                                    | UK                                                                 | Rest of Europe                                                     | US                                                                 | Rest of North America                                              |                                                                    |                                                                    | Russia a                                                           | Rest of Asia                                                       |                                                                    |                                                                    |\n| Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2021                     |\n| Oil wells c                                                        | -

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\n## Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (FRS 101)\n\nThe financial statements of BP p.l.c. for the year ended 31 December 2021 were approved and signed by the chief executive officer on 18 March 2022 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 'Application of Financial Reporting Requirements' (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to:\n\n- (a) the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements';\n- (b) the requirements in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' to present comparative information in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1.\n- (c) the requirements of IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows';\n- (d) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' in relation to standards not yet effective;\n- (e) the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures';\n- (f) the requirements of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member;\n- (g)    the requirements of paragraphs 130(f)(ii), 130(f)(iii), 134(d) to 134(f) and 135(c)-135(e) of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets;\n- (h)    the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment';\n- (i) the requirements of IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'; and\n- (l) the requirement of the second sentence of paragraph 110 and paragraphs 113(a), 114,115, 118, 119(a) to (c), 120 to 127 and 129 of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\nWhere required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c.\n\nThe income statement of the company for 2021 with comparatives is presented for the first time this year.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## Significant accounting policies: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nInherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements is the need for bp management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes on financial statements.\n\nThe areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the financial statements are the recoverability of investment carrying values and pensions. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the financial statements are also set out in boxed text below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the financial statements. These may have significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the company's assets and liabilities discussed below.\n\n## Impairment of investments\n\nThe energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. This, in turn, may affect the recoverable amount of a parent's investments in subsidiaries. Management's best estimate oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing were revised during 2021. The assumption up to 2030 was increased to reflect near-term supply constraints whereas the long-term assumption was decreased as bp's management expects an acceleration of the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy. Henry Hub gas price assumptions remain unchanged from 2020 except that the assumption for 2022 has been increased to reflect short term market conditions. The revised assumptions sit within the range of external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n285",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic environment\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic environment.\n\n## Going concern\n\nLiquidity and financing is managed within bp under pooled group-wide arrangements which include the company. As part of assuring the going concern basis of preparation for the company, the ability and intent of the bp group to support the company has been taken into consideration. The most recent bp group financial statements (see pages 145 to 253) continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. Forecast liquidity has been assessed under a number of stressed scenarios, including a significant decline in oil prices over the 12-month period. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements even if the Brent price fell to zero. In addition, group management of bp have confirmed that the existing intra-group funding and liquidity arrangements as currently constituted are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, being no less than twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. No material uncertainties over going concern or significant judgements or estimates in the assessment were identified. Accordingly, the company will be able to draw on support from the bp group for the foreseeable future and these financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2021 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of defined benefit obligations in the company's defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and Note 4 for further information.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Where these circumstances have reversed, the impairment previously made is reversed to the extent of the original cost of the investment.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\n\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an investment holding company chain (defined as each direct subsidiary and its own investments), is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Determination as to whether, and by how much, an asset or CGU is impaired involves similar estimates.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data. Details of impairment charges recognized in the profit and loss account and the carrying amounts of investments are shown in Note 2. The estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2021 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. It is impracticable to reliably determine the extent of any impacts of changes in the assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the company's investments given the diverse characteristics of the underlying assets and the interdependency of the various inputs. Changes in the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a post-tax discount rate. The discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and in 2021 the pre-tax discount rate typically ranged from 7% to 15% (2020 7% to 15%) depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU.\n\n## Oil and natural gas properties\n\nFor upstream oil and natural gas properties in subsidiaries, expected future cash flows are estimated using management's best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, and production and reserves and certain resources volumes. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors. A change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. Management consider that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n286",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Oil and natural gas prices\n\nThe price assumptions used for value in use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp's carbon emissions cost assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 178. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lowercarbon supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\n\nDuring the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value in use impairment testing for Brent oil up to 2030 were increased to reflect near-term supply constraints. bp's management also expects an acceleration of the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy. As such, the long-term Brent oil assumptions were decreased during the year, reaching $55 per barrel by 2040 and $45 per barrel by 2050 (in 2020 real terms). The price assumptions applied in value in use impairment testing for Henry Hub gas were unchanged to those used in 2020 except that the assumption for 2022 was increased to reflect short term market conditions. These price assumptions are derived from the central case investment appraisal assumptions, adjusted where applicable to reflect short-term market conditions (see page 32). A summary of the group's revised price assumptions, for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas, applied in 2021 and 2020, in real 2020 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management's best estimate of future prices at the balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. An inflation rate of 2% (2020 2%) is applied to determine the price assumptions in nominal terms.\n\n| 2021 price assumptions   |   2022 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |    2050 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |     70 |     60 |     60 |     55 |   45    |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |      4 |      3 |      3 |      3 |    2.75 |\n| 2020 price assumptions   |   2021 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 | 2050    |\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |     50 |     50 |     60 |     60 |   50    |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |      3 |      3 |      3 |      3 |    2.75 |\n\nThe majority of bp's reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the company's subsidiaries holding upstream oil and gas properties are expected to be produced over the next 10 years.\n\n## Oil and natural gas reserves\n\nIn addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to estimate oil and natural gas reserves held by the company's subsidiaries. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nReserves assumptions used for value-in-use tests in the company's subsidiaries reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the financial statements is US dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.\n\nExchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by a non-US dollar functional currency branch are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Income statement transactions are translated into US dollars using the average exchange rate for the reporting period.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe company enters into financial guarantee contracts with its subsidiaries. At the inception of a financial guarantee contract, a liability is recognized initially at fair value and then subsequently measured at the higher of the contract's estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n287",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Share-based payments\n\n## Equity-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions with employees of the company and other members of the group is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date on which they are granted. The cost relating to employees of the company is recognized as an expense and the cost relating to other members of the group is recognized as a cost of investment in subsidiaries over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award. A corresponding credit is recognized within equity. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used, valuation model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company (market conditions). Non-vesting conditions, such as the condition that employees contribute to a savings-related plan, are taken into account in the grant-date fair value, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition, where this is within the control of the employee is treated as a cancellation and any remaining .unrecognized cost is expensed. For other equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the corresponding increase in equity are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless their fair value cannot be reliably estimated. If the fair value of the goods and services received cannot be reliably estimated, the transaction is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n## Cash-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of cash-settled transactions is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, measured by reference to the fair value of the corresponding liability which is recognized on the balance sheet. The liability is remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans are plans that share risks between entities under common control. In each instance BP p.l.c. is the principal employer and carries the whole plan surplus or deficit on its balance sheet. The cost of providing benefits under the group's defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.\n\nNet interest expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.\n\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\n\n## Significant estimate: pensions\n\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions involves making significant estimates when measuring the company's pension plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\n\nPension assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the company's balance sheet, and pension expense for the following year. The assumptions used are provided in Note 4.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the company's pension obligations within the next financial year for the UK plan. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\n\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation used are provided in Note 4.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\n\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n288",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nDeferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be realized in the future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. See Note 6 for further details.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as set out below. The company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been transferred to a third party along with substantially all of the risks and rewards or control of the asset.This includes the derecognition of receivables for which discounting arrangements are entered into.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired and when interest is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nAll financial liabilities held by the company are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities include other payables, accruals, and finance debt. The company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nAll financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.\n\n## Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThe company adopted 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase II - Amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial instruments', IFRS 16 'Leases' and other IFRSs' with effect from 1 January 2021 and it was was applied prospectively from that date. There are no other new or amended standards or interpretations adopted during the year that have a significant impact on the financial statements.\n\nVoluntary change in accounting policy - Cost of equity-settled transactions with employees of other members of the group are recognised as a cost of investment in subsidiaries\n\nAs of 1 January 2021, the company recognises the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees of other members of the group as a cost of investment in subsidiaries. The company previously recognised the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees of other members of the group as an expense.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n289",

As a result, management performed an impairment test of the company's major investments in line with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. In 2020, an impairment charge of $5,965 million a was recognized following the performance of an impairment review in line with the requirements of IAS 36. In 2021, management performed a subsequent review of the company's major investments to identify indicators of potential further impairment. Taking into account the increase in the group's market capitalisation, a decrease in the deficits between the carrying amount of the company's major investments compared with the underlying net assets and the upward revision of oil and natural gas prices, compared to 2020, management concluded that there were no further impairments in terms of a deterioration of value in use or fair value less costs to sell except for anticipated portfolio changes within an operating subsidiary which has resulted in an impairment charge of $1,109 million. Notwithstanding that there have been certain impairment reversals within some of the group's operating subsidiaries during the year, no reversals of previously recognized impairment provisions were determined to be required in respect of the company's investments in subsidiaries.\n\nSee also note 13.

        "page_content": "## 4. Pensions\n\nThe pension obligation consists primarily of a funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chairman nominated by the company. The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. The plan was closed to new joiners in 2010 and was closed to future accrual on 30 June 2021 resulting in a curtailment gain of $0.3 billion being recognized in the income statement during the year. For active members of the plan at 30 June 2021, benefits payable are now linked to salary as at that date, rather than salary on retirement. Employees in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. During 2021 the aggregate level of contributions was $134 million (2020 $189 million). No contributions are expected in 2022.\n\nFor the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of contributions is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2023 formal actuarial valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2021. The closure of the defined benefit plan to future accrual and the consequent lower service cost reduces the plan's expected future funding volatility.\n\nThe surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.\n\nThe obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2021. The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK. The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main pension plan was as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below. The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year and are used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.\n\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation  a   | %    | %    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n|                                                                 | 2021 | 2020 |\n| Discount rate for pension plan liabilities                      | 1.8  | 1.4  |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment                        | 3.2  | 2.8  |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions                           | 3.2  | 2.8  |\n| Inflation for pension plan liabilities                          | 3.3  | 2.9  |\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense         |      | %    |\n|                                                                 | 2021 | 2020 |\n| Discount rate for pension plan service costs                    | 1.5  | 2.1  |\n| Discount rate for pension plan other finance expense  b         | 1.7  | 2.1  |\n| Inflation for pension plan service costs                        | 2.8  | 2.6  |\n\nThe discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments. The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. The inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions.\n\nIn addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. For the main pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows:\n\n| Mortality assumptions                                    |   Years |   Years |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                          |  2021   |  2020   |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60   |    26.9 |    26.9 |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40   |    28.4 |    28.4 |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 |    28.9 |    28.8 |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 |    30.5 |    30.4 |\n\nThe assets of the primary plan are held in a trust, the primary objective of which is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan. The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\n\nA proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term of such assets with an acceptable level of risk. In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.\n\nThe trustee's long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n291",

Pensions - continued\n\nFor the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets with liability matching characteristics over time primarily by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds.

Though due in 2030, the loan is repayable to BP Finance p.l.c. at one business day's notice. It is disclosed as a non-current receivable in the financial statements of BP Finance p.l.c., given the counterparty has no intent to call the loan at short notice.\n\nThe company also has current payables of $4,023 million on Internal Funding Accounts (IFAs) payable to BP International Limited. Whilst IFA credit balances are legally repayable on demand, in practice they have no termination date. These balances form a key part of the bp group's liquidity and funding arrangements under its centralised treasury funding model.\n\nNon-current amounts payable to subsidiaries includes an interest-bearing payable of $52,585 million with BP International Limited issued in December 2021, with interest being charged based on a 3-month USD LIBOR rate plus 75 basis points and a maturity date of December 2028. This new $60,000 million long-term loan facility replaces term loans with BP International Limited of $4,236 million that matured in December 2021 and $27,100 million with a maturity date of May 2023, providing additional long-term funding to the company. The loan includes a prepayment clause for BP p.l.c. to repay part or all of the loan before maturity whilst the lender has no right to call the loan other than in the event of the company being in default. As such it is disclosed as non-current in both the company and BP International Limited financial statements.\n\nThe maturity profile of the non-current financial liabilities included in the balance sheet at 31 December is shown in the table below.

Capital and reserves\n\nSee statement of changes in equity for details of all reserves balances.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.\n\n## Share premium account\n\nThe balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nThe balance on the merger reserve represents the fair value of the consideration given in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and by bp's US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the company and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of the foreign currency branch. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the income statement.\n\n## Profit and loss account\n\nThe balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the company.\n\nThe profit and loss account reserve includes $24,107 million (2020 $23,600 million), the distribution of which is limited by statutory or other restrictions.\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 do not reflect the dividend announced on 8 February 2022 which will be paid in March 2022; this will be treated as an appropriation of profit in the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## 9. Financial guarantees\n\nThe company has issued guarantees under which the maximum aggregate liabilities at 31 December 2021 were $69,611 million (2020 $80,891 million), the majority of which relate to finance debt of subsidiaries. Also included are guarantees of subsidiaries' liabilities under the Consent Decree between the United States, the Gulf states and bp and under the settlement agreement with the Gulf states in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The company has also issued uncapped indemnities and guarantees, including a guarantee of subsidiaries' liabilities under the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee agreement relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

Events after the reporting period\n\nOn 27 February 2022, following the military action in Ukraine, bp announced that it will exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft) a Russian oil and gas company. As of 27 February 2022, bp chief executive officer Bernard Looney also stepped down from the board of Rosneft with immediate effect and has submitted a letter of resignation as did the other Rosneft director nominated by bp, former bp group chief executive Bob Dudley. On the same date bp decided to exit its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia.\n\nThe decision to exit the shareholding in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, combined with the market impact on Russian assets that has arisen following the military action in Ukraine will have a material effect on the company's 2022 financial statements on the carrying amount of bp p.l.c.'s investment, held through BP International Limited, in BP Russian Investments Limited, which at 31 December 2021 stood at approximately $14.8 billion.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n297",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and capital resources\n\n## Financial framework\n\nbp has a resilient financial framework that, taken together with our strategy, creates a compelling investor proposition offering committed distributions, profitable growth and sustainable value. The framework comprises a coherent approach to capital allocation, a resilient balance sheet, a disciplined approach to investment allocation and a relentless focus on executing bp's business plan.\n\nbp's approach to capital allocation leads to a clear set of priorities funding our resilient dividend as the first priority, deleveraging the balance sheet, investment in low carbon \u00ab and convenience and mobility to advance our energy transition strategy, investment in resilient hydrocarbons to generate sustainable cash flow, and then returning surplus cash \u00ab as share buybacks. In a period of low prices, the group has the flexibility to reduce cash costs and to reduce or defer capital investment, as appropriate.\n\nOur shareholder distribution policy reflects these priorities for the uses of cash alongside an ongoing consideration of factors, including changes in the environment, the underlying performance of the business, the outlook for the group financial framework, and other market factors which may vary quarter to quarter.\n\nNet debt \u00ab at 31 December 2021 was $30.6 billion and is expected to reduce in line with the receipt of divestment proceeds and the growth in operating cash flow \u00ab . As at 31 December 2021 our target of $25 billion of divestment and other proceeds between the second half of 2020 and 2025 was underpinned by agreed or completed transactions of around $15.5 billion with almost $12.8 billion of proceeds received.\n\nWe expect operating cash flow to cover capital expenditure \u00ab and the dividend. Capital expenditure in 2021 was $12.8 billion, the lower end of our initial range of $13-15 billion. bp now expects capital expenditure of $14-15 billion in 2022 and continues to expect a range of $14-16 billion per annum through 2025. Looking out across 2022-25, bp's cash balancing point is expected to average around $40 per barrel (assuming an average refining marker margin of around $11 and Henry Hub gas price at $3) in 2020 real terms.\n\nIn 2021, the return on average capital employed \u00ab was 13.3% a at an average of $71 per barrel. The return on average capital employed is targeted to grow to 12-14% by 2025 at $50 to 60 per barrel in 2020 real terms, and assuming bp planning assumptions, as we continue to execute our strategy. This is supported by an expected growth on adjusted EBIDA per share compound annual growth rate \u00ab across the same period and subject to the same price and planning assumptions.\n\n## Dividends and other distributions to shareholders\n\nThe dividend is determined in US dollars, the economic currency of bp, and the dividend level is reviewed by the board each quarter. The quarterly dividend was increased from 5.25 to 5.46 cents per ordinary share per quarter in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe total dividend distributed to bp shareholders in 2021 was $4.3 billion (2020 $6.4 billion). This dividend was all paid in cash as shareholders no longer have the option to receive a scrip dividend in place of receiving cash.\n\nIncluded in the distribution policy is a commitment that, subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, at least 60% of surplus cash will be distributed to shareholders through share buybacks. In 2021 bp executed $3.2 billion of share buybacks (2020 $0.8 billion), including fees and stamp duty. Since 1 January 2022 a further $500 million shares have been repurchased to offset the expected full year dilution from the vesting of awards under employee share schemes in 2022 and an additional $1.0 billion shares have been repurchased up to 1 March 2022, both including fees and stamp duty. On average, based on bp's current forecasts, at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board's discretion each quarter, bp continues to expect to be able to deliver buybacks of around $4.0 billion per annum and have the capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4% through to 2025.\n\n342\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n## Financing the group's activities\n\nThe group's principal commodities, oil and gas, are priced internationally in US dollars. Group policy has generally been to minimize economic exposure to currency movements by financing operations with US dollar debt. Where debt and hybrid bonds are issued in other currencies, they are generally swapped back to US dollars using derivative contracts, or else hedged by maintaining offsetting cash positions in the same currency. Cash balances of the group are mainly held in US dollars or swapped to US dollars and holdings are well diversified to reduce concentration risk. The group is not, therefore, exposed to significant currency risk regarding its cash or borrowings. Also see Risk factors on page 76 for further information on risks associated with prices and markets and Financial statements - Note 28.\n\nThe group's finance debt at 31 December 2021 amounted to $61.2 billion (2020 $72.7 billion). Of the total finance debt, $5.6 billion is classified as short term at the end of 2021 (2020 $9.4 billion). See Financial statements - Note 25 for more information on the short-term balance. Net debt \u00ab was $30.6 billion at the end of 2021, a decrease of $8.3 billion from the 2020 year-end position of $38.9 billion. BP p.l.c. fully and unconditionally guarantees securities issued by BP Capital Markets p.l.c. and BP Capital Markets America Inc., which are 100%-owned finance subsidiaries of BP p.l.c.\n\nDuring 2020 a group subsidiary issued perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds in EUR, GBP and USD for a USD equivalent amount of $11.9 billion. During 2021, a different group subsidiary issued perpetual subordinated hybrid capital securities of $1.0 billion to fund one of the group's major projects. As the group has the unconditional right to avoid transfer of cash or another financial asset in relation to these hybrid bonds, they are classified as equity instruments and reported within noncontrolling interest.\n\nThe ratio of finance debt to finance debt plus total equity at 31 December 2021 was 41.5% (2020 45.9%). Gearing was 25.3% at the end of 2021 (2020 31.3%). See Financial statements - Note 26 for finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis, and for further information on net debt.\n\nCash and cash equivalents of $30.7 billion at 31 December 2021 (2020 $31.1 billion) are included in net debt. We manage our cash position so that the group has adequate cover to respond to potential short-term market liquidity, short term price environment volatility and expect to maintain a robust cash position.\n\nThe group also has an undrawn committed $8 billion credit facility and undrawn committed bank facilities of $4 billion (see Financial statements - Note 28 for more information).\n\nWe believe that the group's resilient balance sheet and strong investment grade credit rating will allow the group to meet its known contractual and other obligations in both the short and long-term with the group having sufficient working capital, taking into account the amounts of undrawn borrowings facilities, access to capital markets, levels of cash and cash equivalents and its ongoing ability to generate cash through operations. This belief is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.\n\nbp utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital including discounting of receivables and, in the supply and trading business, the active management of supplier payment terms, inventory and collateral.\n\nStandard & Poor's Ratings' long-term credit rating for BP p.l.c. is A(stable), the Moody's Investors Service rating is A2 (stable) and the Fitch Ratings' long-term credit rating is A (stable).\n\nThe group's sources of funding, its access to capital markets and maintaining a strong cash position are described in Financial statements Note 24 and Note 28. Further information on the management of liquidity risk and credit risk, and the maturity profile and fixed/floating rate characteristics of the group's debt are also provided in Financial statements - Note 25 and Note 28.\n\nThe information above contains forward-looking statements, which by their nature involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will or may occur in the future and are outside the control of bp.

These amounts are not reflected in the group's debt on the balance sheet. The group has issued third-party guarantees under which amounts outstanding, incremental to amounts recognized on the balance sheet, at 31 December 2021 were $1,407 million (2020 $1,405 million) in respect of liabilities of joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab and $694 million (2020 $661 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. Of these amounts, $1,407 million (2020 $1,393 million) of the joint ventures and associates guarantees relate to borrowings and for other third-party guarantees, $594 million (2020 $568 million) relate to guarantees of borrowings.\n\n## Contractual obligations\n\nThe following table summarizes the group's capital expenditure commitments for property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2021 and the proportion of that expenditure for which contracts have been placed.\n\n|                        | $ million Payments due by period   | $ million Payments due by period   | $ million Payments due by period   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Capital expenditure    | Less than 1  year                  | More than 1  year                  | Total                              |\n| Committed              | 10,064                             | 7,875                              | 17,939                             |\n| of which is contracted | 5,442                              | 2,766                              | 8,208                              |\n\nCapital expenditure is considered to be committed when the project has received the appropriate level of internal management approval. For joint operations \u00ab , the net bp share is included in the amounts above.\n\nIn addition, at 31 December 2021, the group had committed to capital expenditure relating to investments in equity-accounted entities amounting to $4,152 million.

        "page_content": "## Oil and gas disclosures for the group Analysis by region\n\nOur oil and gas operations are set out below by geographical area, with associated significant events for 2021. bp's percentage working interest in oil and gas assets is shown in brackets. Working interest is the costbearing ownership share of an oil or gas lease. Consequently, the percentages disclosed for certain agreements do not necessarily reflect the percentage interests in proved reserves, production or revenue. See page 48 for more information on Rosneft.\n\nIn addition to exploration, development and production activities, our oil production & operations (OP&O) and gas businesses also include certain midstream and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply activities. Midstream activities involve the ownership and management of crude oil and natural gas pipelines, processing facilities and export terminals, LNG processing facilities and transportation, and our natural gas liquids (NGLs) processing business.\n\nOur upstream LNG activities are located in Abu Dhabi, Angola, Australia, Indonesia and Trinidad. In 2021 our production was 10 million tonnes of LNG from these assets, of which two million tonnes were marketed through trading & shipping, which supplements equity production with merchant third party volumes to build a global trading portfolio. The LNG is marketed through contractual rights to access import terminal capacity in the liquid markets of Europe, UK and US, and relationships to market directly to end user customers or trading entities. LNG is supplied to all major LNG demand centres for example Argentina, Baltic Coast, Brazil, Caribbean, China, Croatia, Mediterranean and North West Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and the UK.\n\n## Europe\n\nbp is active in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea. In 2021 bp's production came from three key areas: the Shetland area comprising the Clair, Foinaven, and Schiehallion fields; the central area comprising the Andrew area, Culzean, Vorlich, ETAP and Shearwater fields; and Norway, through our equity accounted 28% interest in Aker BP as at 31 December 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 Production through the Petrojarl Foinaven FPSO vessel was suspended in April due to the vessel reaching the end of its design life. The vessel will be taken off station and the subsea infrastructure preserved while evaluation of future options for the Foinaven field takes place.\n- \u00b7 In May bp announced its intent to retain its interests in the Andrew area, which had previously been marketed for sale. Subsequently, in January 2022, bp acquired JX Nippon's interests in the Andrew area, comprising their 27.39% interest in the Andrew field, their 30% interest in Farragon and their 22.94% interest in Kinnoull.\n- \u00b7 On 11 November bp sold 7,718,571 shares, representing a 2.1% stake in Aker BP ASA, for a total of $273 million. Following the sale, bp now holds a 27.85% interest, Aker holds 37.14% and the portion of shares available to public investors has increased to 35%.\n- \u00b7 On 30 November bp completed the divestment of its non-operated interest in the Shearwater asset located in the UK North Sea to Shell.\n- \u00b7 On 21 December Aker BP announced its proposed acquisition of the oil and gas business of Lundin Energy, through a statutory merger. Following completion of the merger, which is subject to approvals, bp is expected to own 15.9% of the enlarged entity (Aker 21.2%, Nemesia S.\u00e1.r.l 14.4%, other Aker BP and Lundin Energy shareholders 48.6%).\n- \u00b7 In December bp reached an agreement to purchase RockRose Energy's 28% interest in Foinaven, and their 47% interest in East Foinaven with completion expected in the first half of 2022.\n\n## North America\n\nOur upstream activities in North America are located in four areas: deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Lower 48 states, Canada and Mexico.\n\nbp has around 205 lease blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and operates four production hubs.\n\n- \u00b7 On 12 April, bp announced the safe arrival in Texas US of the Argos floating production platform, a major milestone for the Mad Dog 2\n\n344\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n- project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (bp 60.5% and operator). bp expects the Mad Dog Phase 2 project to start up in the second half of 2022.\n- \u00b7 On 13 April, bp announced an oil discovery in a high-quality Miocene reservoir at the Puma West prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (bp 50% and operator). Evaluation is ongoing.\n- \u00b7 On 23 June, bp announced the start-up of the Manuel project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (bp 50% and operator). Manuel includes a new subsea production system for two new wells tied into the Na Kika platform.\n- \u00b7 On 28 September, bp announced the start-up of its Thunder Horse South Expansion Phase 2 project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (bp 75% and operator).\n- \u00b7 bp was the apparent high bidder on 46 leases in Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 257 held in November. In January 2022 the lease sale was annulled by a federal judge on the basis that climate change impacts were not accounted for. bp will work to evaluate options with stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 In February 2022, bp announced the safe and successful start-up of the Herschel Expansion project in the Gulf of Mexico. Phase 1 of the project comprises development of a new subsea production system and the first of up to three wells tied to the Na Kika platform (bp 50% and operator).\n\nSee also Financial Statements - Note 1 for further information on exploration leases.\n\nbpx energy, bp's onshore oil and gas business in the Lower 48 states, has significant operated and non-operated activities across Louisiana and Texas producing natural gas, oil, NGLs and condensate, with primary focus on developing unconventional resources in Texas. It had a 1.5 billion boe proved reserve base at 31 December 2021, predominantly in unconventional reservoirs (tight gas \u00ab , shale gas and shale oil). bpx energy's core assets span 1.5 million net developed acres with 1,900 operated gross wells at 31 December 2021, and daily net production around 296mboe/d.\n\nbpx energy operated as a separate business in 2021 while remaining part of the OP&O segment. With its own governance, systems and processes, it is structured to increase competitive performance through swift decision making and innovation, while maintaining bp's commitment to safe, reliable and compliant operations.\n\nbp's onshore US crude oil and product pipelines and related transportation assets were included in the Customers and Products segment in 2021.\n\nIn Canada bp is focused on pursuing offshore exploration opportunities and its Sunrise Oil Sands operations. We have offshore exploration licences in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and the Canadian Beaufort Sea. In addition to Sunrise Oil Sands we hold an interest in the Terre de Grace partnership. In-situ steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technology is utilized in our existing oil sands operations, which uses the injection of steam into the reservoir to warm the bitumen so that it can flow to the surface through producing wells.\n\n- \u00b7 The order issued by the government of Canada in 2019 prohibiting any work or activity authorized under the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act on frontier lands that are situated in Canadian Arctic offshore waters has been extended until 31 December 2022.\n- \u00b7 In January 2022 bp agreed to sell its interest in the Pike oil sands asset and oil and gas assets located in the Kirby and Leismer fields. The transaction completed at the end of that month.\n\nIn Mexico, during 2021 we held interests in two exploration joint operations in the Salina Basin with Equinor and Total, Block 1 (bp 33% and operator) and Block 3 (bp 33%), and in one exploration joint operation in the Sureste Basin with Total, QPI Mexico and Hokchi Energy, a subsidiary of Pan American Energy Group (PAEG), Block 34 (bp 42.5% and operator). In addition, bp also holds an interest in two other blocks through Hokchi Energy (operator).\n\n- \u00b7 During the year, bp resigned as operator of Block 1 and signed a novation agreement to transfer its working interest to Total who will take over as operator. Regulatory approval for both processes was received in early 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Oil and natural gas\n\n## Resource progression\n\nbp manages its hydrocarbon resources in three major categories: prospect inventory, contingent resources and reserves. When a discovery is made, volumes usually transfer from the prospect inventory to the contingent resources category. The contingent resources move through various sub-categories as their technical and commercial maturity increases through appraisal activity.\n\nAt the point of final investment decision, most proved reserves will be categorized as proved undeveloped (PUD). Volumes will subsequently be recategorized from PUD to proved developed (PD) as a consequence of development activity. When part of a well's proved reserves depends on a later phase of activity, only that portion of proved reserves associated with existing, available facilities and infrastructure moves to PD. The first PD bookings will typically occur at the point of first oil or gas production. Major development projects typically take one to five years from the time of initial booking of PUD to the start of production. Changes to proved reserves bookings may be made due to analysis of new or existing data concerning production, reservoir performance, commercial factors and additional reservoir development activity.\n\nVolumes can also be added or removed from our portfolio through acquisition or divestment of properties and projects. When we dispose of an interest in a property or project, the volumes associated with our adopted plan of development for which we have a final investment decision will be removed from our proved reserves upon completion of the transaction. When we acquire an interest in a property or project, the volumes associated with the existing development and any committed projects will be added to our proved reserves if bp has made a final investment decision and they satisfy the SEC's criteria for attribution of proved status. Following the acquisition, additional volumes may be progressed to proved reserves from non-proved reserves or contingent resources.\n\nNon-proved reserves and contingent resources in a field will only be recategorized as proved reserves when all the criteria for attribution of proved status have been met and the volumes are included in the business plan and scheduled for development, typically within five years. bp will only book proved reserves where development is scheduled to commence after more than five years, if these proved reserves satisfy the SEC's criteria for attribution of proved status and bp management has reasonable certainty that these proved reserves will be produced.\n\nAt the end of 2021 bp had material volumes of proved undeveloped reserves held for more than five years in Russia, Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan, Trinidad, Canada, the North Sea and Indonesia. These are part of ongoing infrastructure-led development activities for which bp has a historical track record of completing comparable projects in these countries. We have no proved undeveloped reserves held for more than five years in our onshore US developments.\n\nIn each case the volumes are being progressed as part of an adopted development plan where there are physical limits to the development timing such as infrastructure limitations, contractual limits including gas delivery commitments, late life compression and the complex nature of working in remote locations, or where there are significant commitments on delivery to the relevant authority.\n\nOver the past five years, bp has annually progressed a weighted average 16% (17% for 2020 five-year average) of our group proved undeveloped reserves (including the impact of disposals and price acceleration effects in PSAs) to proved developed reserves. This equates to a turnover time of six years.\n\nProved reserves as estimated at the end of 2021 meet bp's criteria for project sanctioning and SEC tests for proved reserves. We have not halted or changed our commitment to proceed with any material project to which proved undeveloped reserves have been attributed.\n\nIn 2021 we progressed 899 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves (446 mmboe for our subsidiaries \u00ab alone) to proved developed reserves through ongoing investment in our subsidiaries' and equity-accounted entities' upstream development activities. Total development expenditure, excluding midstream activities, was $11,041 million in 2021 ($6,596 million for subsidiaries and $3,646 million for equity-accounted\n\n348\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\nentities). The major areas with progressed volumes in 2021 were Russia, US, Middle East, Azerbaijan and Trinidad. Revisions of previous estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are due to changes relating to field performance, well results or changes in commercial conditions including price impacts.

In certain cases bp uses numerical simulation as part of a holistic assessment of recovery factor for its fields, where these simulations have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In certain deepwater fields bp has booked proved reserves before production flow tests are conducted, in part because of the significant safety, cost and environmental implications of conducting these tests. The industry has made substantial technological improvements in understanding, measuring and delineating reservoir properties without the need for flow tests. To determine reasonable certainty of commercial recovery, bp employs a general method of reserves assessment that relies on the integration of three types of data:\n\n- \u00b7 well data used to assess the local characteristics and conditions of reservoirs and fluids\n- \u00b7 field scale seismic data to allow the interpolation and extrapolation of these characteristics outside the immediate area of the local well control\n- \u00b7 data from relevant analogous fields.\n\nWell data includes appraisal wells or sidetrack holes, full logging suites, core data and fluid samples. bp considers the integration of this data in certain cases to be superior to a flow test in providing understanding of",

The collection of data from logs, cores, wireline formation testers, pressures and fluid samples calibrated to each other and to the seismic data can allow reservoir properties to be determined over a greater volume than the localized volume of investigation associated with a short-term flow test. There is a strong track record of proved reserves recorded using these methods, validated by actual production levels.\n\n## Governance\n\nbp's centrally controlled process for proved reserves estimation approval forms part of a holistic and integrated system of internal control. It consists of the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Accountabilities of certain officers of the group to ensure that there is review and approval of proved reserves bookings independent of the operating business and that there are effective controls in the approval process and verification that the proved reserves estimates and the related financial impacts are reported in a timely manner.\n- \u00b7 Capital allocation processes, whereby delegated authority is exercised to commit to capital projects that are consistent with the delivery of the group's business plan. A formal review process exists to ensure that both technical and commercial criteria are met prior to the commitment of capital to projects.\n- \u00b7 Internal audit, whose role is to consider whether the group's system of internal control is adequately designed and operating effectively to respond appropriately to the risks that are significant to bp.\n- \u00b7 Approval hierarchy, whereby proved reserves changes above certain threshold volumes require immediate review and all proved reserves require annual central authorization and have scheduled periodic reviews. The frequency of periodic review ensures that 100% of the bp proved reserves base undergoes central review every three years.\n\nbp's vice president of reserves is the individual primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimate. He has more than 28 years of diversified industry experience in reserves estimation with the past 3 years managing the governance and compliance. He is a past Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (Russia & Caspian) and a member of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Expert Group on Resource Management.\n\nNo specific portion of compensation bonuses for senior management is directly related to proved reserves targets. Additions to proved reserves is one of several indicators by which the performance of the gas & low carbon and oil production & operations segments is assessed by the remuneration committee for the purposes of determining compensation bonuses for the executive directors. Other indicators include a number of financial and operational measures.\n\nbp's variable pay programme for the other senior managers in the gas & low carbon and oil production & operations segments is based on individual performance contracts. Individual performance contracts are based on agreed items from the business performance plan, one of which, if chosen, could relate to proved reserves.\n\n## Compliance\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) do not provide specific guidance on reserves disclosures. bp estimates proved reserves in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X and relevant Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&DI) and Staff Accounting Bulletins as issued by the SEC staff.\n\nBy their nature, there is always risk involved in the ultimate development and production of proved reserves including, but not limited to: final regulatory approval; the installation of new or additional infrastructure, as well as changes in oil and gas prices; changes in operating and development costs; and the continued availability of additional development capital. All the group's proved reserves held in subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities are estimated by the group's petroleum engineers or by independent petroleum engineering consulting firms and then assured by the group's petroleum engineers.\n\nDeGolyer & MacNaughton (D&M), an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, has estimated the net proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves, as of 31 December 2021, of certain properties held or controlled by Rosneft as part of our\n\n## Additional disclosures Additional disclosures\n\nequity-accounted proved reserves. The properties evaluated by D&M account for 100% of Rosneft's net proved reserves as of 31 December 2021. The net proved reserves estimates prepared by D&M were prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rule 4-10(a)(1)(32) of Regulation S-X. All reserves estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. bp has filed D&M's independent report on its reserves estimates as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC.\n\nNetherland, Sewell & Associates (NSAI), an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, has estimated the net proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves, as of 31 December 2021, of certain properties owned by bp in the US Lower 48. The properties evaluated by NSAI account for 100% of bp's net proved reserves in the US Lower 48 as of 31 December 2021. The net proved reserves estimates prepared by NSAI were prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rule 4-10(a)(1)-(32) of Regulation S-X. All reserves estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. bp has filed NSAI's independent report on its reserves estimates as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC.\n\nOur proved reserves are associated with both concessions (tax and royalty arrangements) and agreements where the group is exposed to the upstream risks and rewards of ownership, but where our entitlement to the hydrocarbons is calculated using a more complex formula, such as with PSAs. In a concession, the consortium of which we are a part is entitled to the proved reserves that can be produced over the licence period, which may be the life of the field. In a PSA, we are entitled to recover volumes that equate to costs incurred to develop and produce the proved reserves and an agreed share of the remaining volumes or the economic equivalent. As part of our entitlement is driven by the monetary amount of costs to be recovered, price fluctuations will have an impact on both production volumes and reserves.\n\nWe disclose our share of proved reserves held in equity-accounted entities (joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab ), although we do not control these entities or the assets held by such entities. The disclosures include bp's share of proved reserves held by Rosneft and bp's Russia joint ventures. bp announced on 27 February 2022 that it intends to exit its shareholding in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia including these Russian joint ventures.\n\n## bp's estimated net proved reserves and proved reserves replacement\n\n94% of our total proved reserves of subsidiaries at 31 December 2021 were held through joint operations \u00ab (92% in 2020), and 35% of the proved reserves were held through such joint operations where we were not the operator (31% in 2020).\n\nEstimated net proved reserves of crude oil at 31 December 2021 a b c\n\n|                           | Developed   | Undeveloped   | million barrels Total   |\n|---------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| UK                        | 178         | 101           | 279                     |\n| US                        | 705         | 601           | 1,306                   |\n| Rest of North America d   | 24          | 167           | 191                     |\n| South America e           | 5           | 7             | 12                      |\n| Africa                    | 117         | 14            | 131                     |\n| Rest of Asia              | 930         | 449           | 1,379                   |\n| Australasia               | 28          | 4             | 33                      |\n| Subsidiaries              | 1,987       | 1,343         | 3,330                   |\n| Equity-accounted entities | 3,434       | 2,826         | 6,260                   |\n| Total                     | 5,421       | 4,169         | 9,590                   |\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n349",

Natural gas represented about 40% (46% for subsidiaries and 36% for equity-accounted entities) of these reserves. The change includes a net decrease from acquisitions and disposals of 408mmboe (decrease of 282mmboe within our subsidiaries and decrease of 126mmboe within our equity-accounted entities). Acquisition and divestment activity occurred in our equity-accounted entities in the Southern Cone, the North Sea and Russia, and divestment activity in our subsidiaries in the US, the Middle East and the North Sea.\n\nThe proved reserves replacement ratio \u00ab is the extent to which production is replaced by proved reserves additions. This ratio is expressed in oil equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to previous estimates, improved recovery, and extensions and discoveries. For 2021, the proved reserves replacement ratio excluding acquisitions and disposals was 50% (78% in 2020 and 67% in 2019) for subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities, 4% for subsidiaries alone and 119% for equity-accounted entities alone. There was a net increase (55mmboe) of reserves due to higher gas and oil prices within the US, North Sea and Angola partly offset by decreases related to price in some of our PSAs in Iraq, Azerbaijan and Canada.\n\nIn 2021 net additions to the group's proved reserves (excluding production and sales and purchases of reserves-in-place) amounted to 609mmboe (31mmboe for subsidiaries and 578mmboe for equityaccounted entities), through revisions to previous estimates including price, improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields. The subsidiary additions were through improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields where they represented a mixture of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves. Volumes added in 2021 principally resulted from the application of conventional technologies and extensions of field size by development drilling. The principal proved reserves additions in our subsidiaries by region were in the US, North Africa, Middle East, the North Sea, Angola and India. The principal reserves additions in our equityaccounted entities were in Rosneft and Pan American Energy Group.\n\n13% of our proved reserves are associated with PSAs. The countries in which we produced under PSAs in 2021 were Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Oman. In addition, the technical service contract (TSC) governing our investment in the Rumaila field in Iraq functions as a PSA.\n\nThe group holds no licences due to expire within the next three years that would have a significant impact on bp's reserves or production.\n\nFor further information on our reserves see page 261.",

Instead, it forms part of a larger transaction that includes, for example, normal operations and maintenance expenditure. The figures for environmental operating and capital expenditure in the table are therefore estimates, based on the definitions and guidelines of the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nEnvironmental operating expenditure of $362 million in 2021 (2020 $531 million) showed an overall decrease of 32%, largely due to the Alaska disposal, decreased expenditure in BP Products North America and the Shipping businesses.\n\nEnvironmental capital expenditure of $222 million in 2021 was slightly lower overall (2020 $241 million) with reduction in expenditure for BP Products North America and the Alaska disposal, balanced out by an increase in expenditure for BPX Energy.\n\nClean-up costs were $17 million in 2021 (2020 $29 million) representing oil spill clean-up costs and other associated remediation and disposal costs. The reduction compared to 2020 results largely from the Alaska disposal and decreased expenditure in BP Products North America, Amoco Environment Services and Remediation Management.\n\nIn addition to operating and capital expenditure, we also establish provisions for future environmental remediation work. Expenditure against such provisions normally occurs in subsequent periods and is not included in environmental operating expenditure reported for such periods.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Generally, this coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.\n\nThe extent and cost of future environmental restoration, remediation and abatement programmes are inherently difficult to estimate. They often depend on the extent of contamination, and the associated impact and timing of the corrective actions required, technological feasibility and bp's share of liability. Though the costs of future programmes could be significant and may be material to the results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not expected that such costs will be material to the group's overall results of operations or financial position.\n\nAdditions to our environmental remediation provision were similar to prior years and also reflects scope reassessments of the remediation plans of a number of our sites in the US. The charge for environmental remediation provisions in 2021 included $33 million in respect of provisions for new sites (2020 $8 million and 2019 $9 million).\n\nIn addition, we make provisions on installation of our oil and gas producing assets and related pipelines to meet the cost of eventual decommissioning. On installation of an oil or natural gas production facility, a provision is established that represents the discounted value of the expected future cost of decommissioning the asset.\n\nIn 2021, the net increase in the decommissioning provision was due to recognition of additional provisions, a change in the discount rate, and a change in cost estimate assumptions.\n\nWe undertake periodic reviews of existing provisions. These reviews take account of revised cost assumptions, changes in decommissioning requirements and any technological developments.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation and decommissioning are usually established on a discounted basis, as required by IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'.\n\n356\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\nFurther details of decommissioning and environmental provisions appear in Financial statements - Note 22.\n\n## Regulation of the group's business\n\nOur businesses and operations are subject to the laws and regulations applicable in each country, state or other regional or local area in which they occur. These cover virtually all aspects of bp's activities and include matters such as the acquisition of rights to develop and operate projects, production rates, royalties, environmental, health and safety protection, fuel specifications and transportation, trading, pricing, anti-trust, export, taxes, and foreign exchange.\n\n## Oil and gas contractual and regulatory framework\n\nThe terms and conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which our upstream oil and gas interests are held vary from country to country. These leases, licences and contracts are generally granted by or entered into with a government entity or state-owned or controlled company and are sometimes entered into with private property owners. Arrangements with governmental or state entities usually take the form of licences or production-sharing agreements \u00ab (PSAs), although arrangements with private entities and the US government entities are usually by lease.\n\nLicences (or concessions) give the holder the right to explore for, develop and produce a commercial discovery. Under a licence, the holder bears the risk of exploration, development and production activities and provides the financing for these operations. In principle, the licence holder is entitled to all production, minus any royalties that are payable in kind. A licence holder is generally required to pay production taxes or royalties, which may be in cash or in kind.\n\nIn certain countries, separate licences are required for exploration and production activities, and in some cases production licences are limited to only a portion of the area covered by the original exploration licence.\n\nPSAs entered into with a government entity or state-owned or controlled company generally require bp (alone or with other contracting companies) to provide all the financing and bear the risk of exploration and production activities in exchange for a share of the production remaining after royalties, if any. Less typically, bp may explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons under a service agreement with the host entity in exchange for reimbursement of costs and/or a fee paid in cash rather than production.\n\nbp frequently conducts its exploration and production activities in joint arrangements \u00ab or co-ownership arrangements with other international oil companies, state-owned or controlled companies and/or private companies. Conventionally, all costs, benefits, rights, obligations, liabilities and risks incurred in carrying out joint arrangement or co-ownership operations under a lease, licence or PSA are shared among the joint arrangement or co-owning parties according to agreed ownership interests which are set-out in a joint operating agreement. To the extent that any liabilities arise, whether to governments or third parties, or as between the joint arrangement parties or co-owners themselves, each joint arrangement party or co-owner will generally be liable under the terms of a joint operating agreement to meet these in proportion to its ownership interest. Any agreed allocation of liability amongst the joint arrangement parties is however often different to the position under the relevant licence, lease or PSA which may provide for joint and several liability of the joint arrangement parties including for decommissioning obligations. In many upstream operations, a party (known as the operator) will be appointed (pursuant to a joint operating agreement) to carry out day to-day operations on behalf of the joint arrangement or co-ownership. The operator is typically one of the joint arrangement parties or a coowner and will carry out its duties either through its own staff, or by contracting out various elements to third-party contractors or service providers. bp acts as operator on behalf of joint arrangements and coownerships in a number of countries .\n\nFrequently, work (including drilling and related activities) will be contracted out to third-party service providers. The relevant contract will specify the work, the remuneration, and typically the risk allocation between the parties. Depending on the service to be provided, the contract may also contain provisions allocating risks and",

        "page_content": "liabilities associated with pollution and environmental damage, damage to a well or hydrocarbon reservoirs and for claims from third parties or other losses. The allocation of those risks vary among contracts and are determined through negotiation between the parties .\n\nIn general, bp incurs income tax on income generated from production activities (whether under a licence or PSA). In addition, depending on the area, bp's production activities may be subject to a range of other taxes, levies and assessments, including special petroleum taxes and revenue taxes. The taxes imposed on oil and gas production profits and activities may be substantially higher than those imposed on other activities, for example in Abu Dhabi, Angola, Egypt, Norway, the UK, the US, Russia and Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nbp is closely studying the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's two pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. The Pillar Two model rules were published on 20 December 2021, with legislation currently expected to be substantively enacted during 2022 and applicable from 2023. The tax accounting impact will be considered when the relevant legislation is published.\n\n## Low carbon energy - renewables contractual and regulatory framework\n\nThe majority of our interests in renewable assets are held indirectly through incorporated joint ventures or special purpose entities (in either case, a Project Company). The renewables contractual and regulatory framework and the rights granted in relation to a renewable asset significantly vary from country to country. In some countries, the regulatory framework is still under development or subject to significant change as the renewable industry evolves.\n\nIn general terms our rights to a renewable asset are usually held by the Project Company through a package of assets that together form the renewable project owned by such Project Company, including:\n\n- \u00b7 one or more leases, easements, or licences over land or seabed granted by a public or private individual or entity that grant the Project Company rights to develop, build and operate the renewable asset in such areas of land or seabed;\n- \u00b7 one or more generation licences that grant the Project Company the right to produce and sell the electricity to the market;\n- \u00b7 an interconnection agreement that grants the Project Company the right to connect the power project into the grid;\n- \u00b7 an offtake agreement which, depending on the country's electricity market, is entered into with a utility company, a corporate buyer or a public entity; and\n- \u00b7 potentially, a subsidy mechanism in the form of a feed in tariff, contract for difference, hedging mechanism or renewable energy certificate to support the development of the project.\n\nThe risk allocation between the developer/generator and the host government or private entity has not been standardized in the industry. However, in general terms the Project Company bears the risk of the development, construction and operation of the renewable energy project and provides the financing for these operations and profit from the revenue generated through the offtake agreement and/or subsidy mechanism (if available).\n\n## Sustainable finance\n\nIn 2020, elements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation entered into force and became part of UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018. Whilst details of the EU Taxonomy Regulation are still being considered, it establishes a classification system for determining whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable for the purposes of guiding investors in financial products which are marketed as promoting environmental objectives. Although the UK government has expressed its intention to retain the overall taxonomy framework and objectives as set forth in the EU Taxonomy Regulation, it is not yet clear to what extent UK law will align with elements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation that do not form part of retained EU law, including the disclosure requirements for large corporate firms. bp may in the future be required to comply with the\n\n## Additional disclosures Additional disclosures\n\nTaxonomy Regulation or any parallel or similar legislation which may come into force in the UK.\n\n## Greenhouse gas regulation\n\nIn December 2015, nearly 200 nations at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris (COP21) agreed to the Paris Agreement which aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Signatories aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter, so as to achieve a balance between human caused emissions and removals by sinks of GHGs in the second half of this century. The Paris Agreement commits all signatories to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (i.e. pledges or plans of climate action) and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the objectives of their NDCs. Signatories are required to submit revised NDCs every five years, and the revised NDC's are expected to be more ambitious with each revision. Global assessments of progress will occur every five years, starting in 2023.\n\nAgreement of rules which could enable international carbon trading to assist in meeting NDCs was adopted at the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021. More stringent national and regional measures relating to the transition to a lower carbon economy, such as the UK's 2050 net zero carbon emissions commitment, can be expected in the future. These measures could increase bp's production costs for certain products, increase compliance and litigation costs, increase demand for competing energy alternatives or products with lower-carbon intensity, and affect the sales and specifications of many of bp's products. Further, such measures could lead to constraints on production and supply and access to new reserves, particularly due to the long term nature of many of bp's projects. Certain current and announced GHG measures and developments potentially affecting bp's businesses in various markets in which bp operates are summarized below. For information on steps that bp is taking in relation to climate change issues and for details of bp's GHG reporting, see Sustainability - Net zero aims on page 51.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the US, bp's operations are affected by GHG regulation in a number of ways. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA), for example, regulates air emissions, permitting, fuel specifications and other aspects of our production, refining, distribution and marketing activities.\n\nThe administration of US President Barack Obama had proposed regulating emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas sector. In August 2020 the administration of US President Donald Trump's final policy rule eliminating federal regulation of methane emissions in oil and gas production was invalidated by the US Congress. Under the current administration of US President Joseph Biden, the EPA has issued proposed 'Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review' which are in the public comment period. These regulations would require significant reductions in methane emissions from oil and gas production at new and existing facilities.\n\nOther EPA GHG and environmental regulations affect electricity generation practices and prices and have an impact on the market for fuels used to generate electricity and on renewable energy installations. These regulations are in flux due to changes in approach between presidential administrations, as well as lawsuits challenging those regulations. The Supreme Court is expected to consider aspects of the regulatory authority granted to EPA under the Clean Air Act in a pending case, West Virginia v. EPA, which may limit EPA's ability to regulate GHG emissions .\n\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 impose the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), requiring transportation fuel sold in the United States to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. In the latest regulatory action, on December 7, 2021, EPA proposed a package of actions setting biofuel volumes for the RFS\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n357",

In addition, certain state initiatives impose carbon-intensity reduction requirements on transportation fuels sold in those states (e.g., in California, Oregon, and soon to be promulgated regulations in Washington).\n\nThe GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule, requires operators of certain facilities and producers and importers/exporters of petroleum products to file annual GHG emissions reports with EPA quantifying direct emissions from affected facilities, as well as volumes of petroleum products, certain natural gas liquids and GHG products and notional GHG emissions as if these products were fully combusted.\n\nA number of states, municipalities and regional organizations continue to advance climate initiatives that affect our US operations. For example, California extended its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to 2030 with a 20% reduction in carbon intensity required by that time. The State of Washington enacted a state-wide carbon cap and invest legislation and a Clean Fuel Standard (similar to California's LCFS) in 2021.\n\nOur US businesses are subject to increased GHG and other environmental requirements and regulatory uncertainty, including that the current or any future US administration could revise or revoke current or prior administration programs, as well as the possibility of increased expenditures in having to comply with numerous diverse and non-uniform regulatory initiatives at the state and local level.\n\nUS fuel markets are affected by EPA regulation of light, medium and heavy duty vehicle emissions (both fuel economy and tailpipe standards) as well as for non-road engines and vehicles and certain large GHG stationary emission sources. The state of California also imposes Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) standards on vehicle manufacturers, and a number of other states, as allowed by CAA authority, have adopted California's standards. These regulations may impact bp's product mix and demand for particular products in those states. In August 2020, California also entered into agreements with several carmakers to meet more demanding emissions standards in California.\n\nIn December 2021, the Biden administration revised the fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks covering model years (MY) 2023 through 2026 that the Trump administration had previously rolled back. The revised standards are more stringent through MY 2026 than the August 2020 agreements California reached with several carmakers. EPA is also restoring California's Clean Air Act waiver allowing it to set its own GHG automotive tailpipe standards and for other states to adopt those standards, and the Department of Transportation repealed the Trump administration's rule pre-empting state GHG standards.\n\nIn January 2020, EPA solicited comment on a proposed rulemaking known as the Cleaner Trucks Initiative. The rule would, among other things, establish new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other pollutants for highway heavy-duty engines and the Biden administration is expected to modify and continue this proposed rulemaking. California has also adopted a 'Heavy-Duty Low NOx Omnibus Regulation' which will require manufacturers to comply with stricter emissions standards and at least one state has opted into those California standards. The rule is being phased in, with the first phase effective in 2024. bp continues to monitor these rules for implications for fuels. These and other EPA initiatives to reduce GHG emissions may have a significant effect on the production, sale and profitability of many of bp's products in the US.\n\n## European Union energy and climate legislation\n\n- \u00b7 The EU and its member states have adopted various targets and measures seeking to reduce GHG emissions and promote renewables. These include the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS); the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) - including an obligation on transport fuel suppliers to increase the share of renewables of their fuel supply; and CO2 targets for the sales of new vehicles which are expected to accelerate the decarbonisation of the transport sector and impact fuel demand.\n- \u00b7 The EU has adopted a goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 as part of the European Green Deal and, subsequently, a 55% GHG\n\n358\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\nreduction target by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. To achieve this target, the European Commission proposed a set of measures in 2021 - as part of the so called 'Fit for 55' and 'gas decarbonisation' packages. Pending agreement by member states and the European Parliament, this would lead to increased ambition levels across various EU legislative instruments and initiatives, including higher shares of renewables across all sectors, a reduced number of GHG emission allowances under the EU ETS, and potentially a target of zero gramme of CO2 per km for new passenger cars by 2035. New measures, if adopted, would be expected to increase the supply and demand of renewable fuel and energy, extend emissions trading to the maritime sector and emissions from road transport and heating fuels. The European Commission also proposed measures to reduce methane emissions.\n\n- \u00b7 Some EU member states have adopted national targets above and beyond current EU climate goals, such as Germany, with a climate neutrality target by 2045 and a national emissions trading system for transport and heating fuels.\n\n## Other\n\n- \u00b7 In December 2020 the UK Government announced a targeted reduction in the UK's GHG emissions of at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.\n- \u00b7 The UK Emissions Trading System (UK ETS) launched on 1 January 2021 following the end of the Brexit transition period and the UK's participation in the EU ETS. It seeks to provide a carbon pricing mechanism as a tool for helping achieve the UK's net zero target and covers the same GHGs and sectors as the EU ETS. bp's North Sea operations are subject to the UK ETS.\n- \u00b7 China is operating emission trading pilot programmes in a number of cities and provinces. One of bp's subsidiaries in China is participating in these programmes. China launched its national emissions trading market (National ETS), initially covering the power sector only, politically in 2017. On 31 December 2020, China promulgated the national regulation on National ETS which became effective on 1 February 2021, when the National ETS was officially launched. The National ETS is intended to be an essential tool for China to fulfil its commitment to reach peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. For now, the National ETS participants are limited to the key emission entities identified by each provincial-level government authority and approved by Ministry for Ecology and Environment of China. bp is not participating the National ETS.\n- \u00b7 In September 2021, China announced at the United Nations General Assembly that China would not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. In October 2021, ahead of the start of COP26, China issued a working guidance for carbon dioxide peak and carbon neutrality which sets out specific targets and measures for both reaching peak emissions and carbon neutrality, and an action plan for carbon dioxide peak before 2030 which sets out the main objectives for the next decade to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030.\n\n## Other environmental regulation\n\nIn addition to GHG regulations referred to above, climate change programmes and regulation of unconventional oil and gas extraction under a number of environmental laws may have a significant effect on the production, sale and profitability of many of bp's products.\n\nEnvironmental laws also require bp to remediate and restore areas affected by the release of hazardous substances or hydrocarbons associated with our operations or properties. These laws may apply to sites that bp currently owns or operates, sites that it previously owned or operated, or sites used for the disposal of its and other parties' waste. See Financial Statements - Note 22 for information on provisions for environmental restoration and remediation.\n\nA number of pending or anticipated governmental proceedings against certain bp group companies under environmental laws could result in monetary or other sanctions. Group companies are also subject to environmental claims for personal injury and property damage alleging the release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The costs associated with future environmental remediation obligations, governmental proceedings and claims could be significant and may be material to the results of operations in the",

For a discussion of the group's environmental expenditure, see page 356 and for a discussion of legal proceedings, see page 248.\n\nSignificant health, safety and environmental legislation and regulation in the US and the EU affecting our businesses and profitability, in addition to those referred to above, include the following:\n\n## United States\n\n- \u00b7 The Clean Water Act regulates wastewater and other effluent discharges from bp's facilities, and bp is required to obtain discharge permits, install control equipment and implement operational controls and preventative measures.\n- \u00b7 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulates the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of wastes associated with our operations and can require corrective action at locations where such wastes have been disposed of or released. bp has incurred, or is likely to incur, liability under RCRA or similar state laws in connection with sites bp operates or previously operated.\n- \u00b7 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) can, in certain circumstances, impose the entire cost of investigation and remediation on a party who owned or operated a site contaminated with a hazardous substance, or who arranged for disposal of a hazardous substance at a site. bp has incurred, or is likely to incur, liability under CERCLA or similar state laws, including costs attributed to insolvent or unidentified parties. bp is also subject to claims for remediation costs and natural resource damages under CERCLA and other federal and state laws.\n- \u00b7 The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires reporting on the storage, use and releases of certain quantities of listed hazardous substances to designated government agencies.\n- \u00b7 The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulates bp's manufacture, import, export, sale and use of chemical substances and products. In addition, EPA has revised processes and procedures for prioritisation of existing chemicals for risk evaluation, assessment and management. Agency actions and announcements are monitored regularly to identify developments with potential impacts on chemical substances important to bp products and operations.\n- \u00b7 The Occupational Safety and Health Act imposes workplace safety and health requirements on bp operations along with significant process safety management obligations, requiring continuous evaluation and improvement of operational practices to enhance safety and reduce workplace emissions at gas processing, refining and other regulated facilities. On November 5, 2021, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration published an emergency temporary standard (ETS) requiring employers with more than 100 employees to require employees either to get fully vaccinated or to test weekly for COVID-19. The vaccine-or-test requirement was scheduled to come into force February 9, 2022, but on January 13, 2022 the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the ETS pending further review by a lower court. The ultimate outcome of the litigation regarding the validity of the ETS is uncertain. Also, in many states there has been an evolving range of executive orders and state and local statutes mandating COVID-19 response measures that may impact bp personnel and operations .\n- \u00b7 The Oil Pollution Act 1990 (OPA) imposes operational requirements, liability standards and other obligations governing the transportation of petroleum products in US waters. States may impose additional obligations. Alaska and the West Coast states currently have the most demanding state requirements.\n- \u00b7 The Outer Continental Shelf Land Act, the Mineral Leasing Act and other statutes give the Department of Interior (DOI) and the BLM authority to regulate operations and air emissions, including equipment and testing, on offshore and onshore operations on federal lands subject to DOI authority .\n\n## Additional disclosures Additional disclosures\n\n- \u00b7 The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act protect certain species' habitats from adverse human impacts by restricting operations or development at certain times and in certain places. In 2020, the US Fish and Wildlife Service published two rules impacting habitat designations under the ESA, but in October 2021, the Biden administration proposed to rescind those rules. If the Biden administration proposed rules are finalized, they could expand the geographic areas subject to habitat protections.\n\n## European Union\n\n- \u00b7 The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) 2010 provides the framework for granting permits for major industrial sites. It lays down rules on integrated prevention and control of air, water and soil pollution arising from industrial activities. As part of the IED framework, additional emission limit values are informed by sector specific and cross-sector Best Available Technology (BAT) Conclusions. These include the BAT Conclusions for the refining sector, for large combustion plants as well as common wastewater and waste gas treatment and management systems in the chemical sector. These may require bp to further reduce its emissions, particularly its air and water emissions .\n- \u00b7 The EU Registration, Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation 2006 requires registration of chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU, together with the submission of relevant hazard and risk data. REACH affects our manufacturing or trading/import operations in the EU. bp maintains compliance by checking whether imports are covered by the registrations of non-EU suppliers' representatives, preparing and submitting registration dossiers to cover new manufactured and imported substances, and updating previously submitted registrations as required. Some substances registered previously, including substances supplied to us by third parties for our use, are now subject to evaluation and review for potential authorization or restriction procedures, and possible banning, by the European Chemicals Agency and EU member state authorities. In addition, bp's facilities and operations in several EU countries continue to undergo REACH compliance inspections by the competent authority for the respective EU member state. An amendment to the Annex of the Regulation on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixture (CLP Regulation) requires harmonized notification of information on hazardous materials (certain lubricant and fuel formations) to EU member state poison centres. The uniform notification rules applied as of January 2020 for consumer products, from 2021 for professional and will apply from 2024 for industrial uses. Following the end of the Brexit transition period in the UK, REACH formed part of retained EU law and the UK introduced a parallel UK REACH regime which applies in Great Britain only with REACH continuing to apply in Northern Ireland. Although UK REACH contains equivalent requirements to REACH, future developments are uncertain.\n- \u00b7 The EU Offshore Safety Directive was adopted in 2013. Its purpose is to introduce a harmonized regime aimed at reducing the potential environmental, health and safety impacts of the offshore oil and gas industry throughout EU waters. The Directive has been implemented in the UK primarily through the Offshore Installations (Offshore Safety Directive) (Safety Case etc.) Regulations 2015.\n- \u00b7 The Water Framework Directive (WFD) published in 2000 aims to protect the quantity and quality of ground and surface waters of the EU member states. The implementation in the EU member states is still ongoing, planned to be finalised by 2027. Future proceedings on the determination of pollutants/priority substances as well as environmental quality standards in line with the WFD may require additional compliance efforts and increased costs for managing freshwater withdrawals and discharges from bp's EU operations.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nFollowing the UK's exit from the European Union, operative EU laws were retained in UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The vast majority of environment related statutory instruments passed by the UK Government in anticipation of Brexit made no substantive changes to the current EU underlying regime, but rather sought to make the amendments required to allow their continued operation after the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. The UK Government's 2021 Environment Act and 25 Year Plan will be central to the UK's\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n359",

The Environment Act comprises various key parts including governance, waste and resource efficiency, air quality and environmental recall, water, nature and biodiversity and conservation covenants. The governance parts include a comprehensive framework for legally-binding environmental improvement targets; establish a framework for future policy statements on environmental principles to protect the environment by making environmental considerations a key part of policy development process across government; and establish the Office for Environmental Protection. Not all parts of the Act are yet in force and key details such as the final environment improvement targets have not yet been announced.\n\n## Other countries and regions\n\nRegulations governing the discharge of treated water have also been developed in countries outside of the US and EU. This includes regulations in Trinidad and Angola which impacts bp's production operations in those countries. In Trinidad, bp commissioned a new waste water treatment plant in 2020 to meet consent levels agreed with the regulators to apply water discharge rules arising from the Certificate of Environmental Clearance (CEC) Regulations 2001 and associated Water Pollution Rules 2007. In Angola, bp has upgraded produced water treatment systems to meet revised oil in water limits for produced water discharge under Executive Decree ED 97-14.\n\nThe Abidjan Convention, along with the Additional Protocol published in 2012, sets environmental quality standards for the discharge of chemicals to the marine environment. Mauritania and Senegal are both signatories to the Abidjan Convention. bp is currently constructing the offshore facilities to include produced water management systems to meet the environmental quality standards for our future gas operations in Mauritania and Senegal.\n\n## Environmental maritime regulations\n\nbp's shipping operations are subject to extensive national and international regulations governing operations, training, pollution prevention, liability, and insurance. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Liability and spill prevention and planning requirements governing, among others, tankers, barges, and offshore facilities are imposed by OPA in US waters. OPA also mandates a levy on imported and domestically produced oil to fund oil spill responses. Some states, including Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California, impose additional liability for oil spills. Outside US territorial waters, bp shipping tankers are subject to international pollution prevention, liability, spill response and preparedness regulations developed through the UN's International Maritime Organization (IMO), including the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), the International Convention on Oil Pollution, Preparedness, Response and Co-operation, and the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage. In April 2010, the Hazardous and Noxious Substance (HNS) Protocol 2010 was adopted to address issues that have inhibited ratification of the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea 1996. As at 31 December 2021, the HNS Convention had not entered into force.\n- \u00b7 A global sulphur cap of 0.5% applies to marine fuel under MARPOL. In order to comply, ships either need to consume low sulphur marine fuels, operate on alternative low sulphur fuels such as LNG or implement approved abatement technology to enable them to meet the low sulphur emissions requirements while continuing to use higher sulphur fuel. This global cap does not alter the lower limits that apply in the sulphur oxides Emissions Control Areas established by the IMO.\n- \u00b7 From 2023 all vessels over 400 gross tonnage will be subject to IMO requirements as to energy efficiency design (EEXI) and the carbon intensity of operations (CII).\n- \u00b7 Under proposed EU legislation (pending approval by the European Parliament) maritime transport will be brought within the ambit of the EU ETS from 2023, applicable to all vessels over 5000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports regardless of a vessel's flag.\n- \u00b7 The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR), aims to protect the marine\n\n360\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\nenvironment of the North-East Atlantic. The OSPAR 2012 Recommendation and Guideline for the implementation of a riskbased approach to the management of produced water discharges from offshore installations in the North Sea supports a key goal of working towards eliminating harmful discharges. In 2020 the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers issued a report 'Oil And Gas Risk Based Assessment of Offshore Produced Water Discharges' which presents industry good practice and aims to broaden the understanding and acceptance of Risk Based Assessment (RBA) techniques internationally and improve consistency in the application of assumptions, levels of conservatism, and selection of risk endpoints.\n\nTo meet its financial responsibility requirements, BP Shipping maintains marine oil pollution liability insurance in respect of its operated ships to a maximum limit of $1 billion for each occurrence through mutual insurance associations (P&I Clubs), although there can be no assurance that a spill would necessarily be adequately covered by insurance or that liabilities would not exceed insurance recoveries.\n\n## International trade sanctions\n\nDuring the period covered by this report, non-US subsidiaries \u00ab , or other non-US entities of bp, conducted limited activities in, or with persons from, certain countries identified by the US Department of State as State Sponsors of Terrorism or otherwise subject to US, EU and UK sanctions (Sanctioned Countries). Sanctions restrictions continue to be insignificant to the group's financial condition and results of operations. bp monitors its activities with Sanctioned Countries, persons from Sanctioned Countries and individuals and companies subject to US, EU and UK sanctions and seeks to comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations.\n\nbp has a 28.83% interest in and operates the Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz), has a 28.83% interest in and performs some operations for a related gas pipeline entity, South Caucasus Pipeline Company Limited (SCPC), and has a 23% non-operating interest in a related gas marketing entity, Azerbaijan Gas Supply Company Limited (AGSC). Naftiran Intertrade Co. Limited and NICO SPV Limited (collectively, NICO) have a 10% non-operating interest in each of Shah Deniz and SCPC and an 8% non-operating interest in AGSC. Shah Deniz, SCPC and AGSC continue in operation as they were excluded from the application of US sanctions and fall within the exception for certain natural gas projects under Section 603 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRA).\n\nOn 3 December 2018 bp entered into an agreement with, among others, SOCAR and NICO pursuant to which SOCAR pays to BP Exploration (Shah Deniz) Limited (BPXSD), as the Shah Deniz operator, compensation for NICO's waiver of its right to lift its share of Shah Deniz condensate. Such amounts are used to cover cash calls to NICO in respect of operating costs due from NICO to BPXSD. On 26 October 2020, OFAC issued an amended licence in relation to these arrangements.\n\nFollowing the imposition in 2011 of further US and EU sanctions against Syria, bp terminated all sales of crude oil and petroleum products into Syria, though bp continues to supply aviation fuel to non-governmental Syrian resellers outside of Syria.\n\nbp has a joint arrangement in Cuba which imports, manufactures, markets and sells lubricants.\n\nDuring 2014, the US and the EU imposed sanctions on certain sectors of the Russian economy (energy, finance and defence/military) and on certain individuals and entities, including Rosneft. These sectoral sanctions include restrictions on the provision of financial assistance, technical assistance, and services in relation to exploration and production activity in deep water, shale, and offshore Arctic.\n\nAdditional US sanctions have been imposed since 2014, broadening the scope of US sanctions on Russia-related activity to include certain international deep water, shale, and offshore Arctic projects as well as the provision of goods and services for Russian energy export pipelines.\n\nIn response to Russia's military action in Ukraine in 2022, the US, EU, UK and many other countries have imposed broad economic and trade sanctions. The scope of these sanctions has evolved at pace and continues to do so across various jurisdictions including restrictions on dealing with designated individuals and entities; restrictions on the",

        "page_content": "Russian financial sector; blocking economic activity in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions of Ukraine; and imposing export controls limiting the export of a wide range of goods and technical assistance to Russia. In the US, President Biden has issued an Executive Order prohibiting: the importation into the US of crude oil, LNG and various other hydrocarbon products of Russian origin; new investment in the Russian energy sector by US persons; and designates certain participatory actions by US persons or persons within the US in transactions which are prohibited.\n\nOn 15 March 2022, the EU issued further sanctions prohibiting dealings with entities established in Russia and specifically designated certain Russian entities within the relevant EU regulation. Rosneft is one of the specifically designated entities. Limited exemptions apply to these prohibitions including in respect of transactions which are necessary for the purchase, import or transport of fossil fuels (including oil and gas) and other commodities into the EU, and transactions relating to energy projects outside of Russia in which a sanctioned entity is a minority shareholder.\n\nThe EU has also prohibited certain investments, financing and participation in the Russian energy sector. This includes prohibiting the acquisition of any new, or the extension of any existing, participation in any legal entity or body, whether established in Russian or any non-EU country which operates in the Russian energy sector and the provision of credit or certain other financing to such entities. The creation of new joint ventures with such entities is also prohibited. Derogations from these prohibitions may be sought if an activity is necessary for ensuring critical energy supply to the EU or it exclusively concerns a legal entity operating in the Russian energy sector and which is owned by an EU legal entity.\n\nIn response, Russia has implemented new counter-sanctions including restrictions on the divestment from Russian assets by foreign investors and a temporary prohibition on registrars and depositories from making payment of dividends and interest on Russian securities in favour of foreign investors. Further details including confirmation of the precise terms or application of these counter-sanctions are not yet known.\n\nThe situation is fast moving and bp continues to monitor the impact of sanctions and other international restrictions on our current business activities, income and investment in Russia.\n\nbp maintains bank accounts and has registered and paid required fees to maintain registrations of patents and trademarks in certain Sanctioned Countries.\n\nbp has equity interests in non-operated joint arrangements \u00ab with air fuel sellers, resellers, and fuel delivery services around the world.\n\nFrom time to time, the joint arrangement operator or other partners may sell or deliver fuel to airlines from Sanctioned Countries or flights to Sanctioned Countries, without bp's involvement.\n\nbp has no control over the activities non-controlled associates \u00ab may undertake in Sanctioned Countries or with persons from Sanctioned Countries.\n\n## Disclosure pursuant to ITRA Section 219\n\nTo our knowledge, none of bp's activities, transactions or dealings are required to be disclosed pursuant to ITRA Section 219, with the following possible exception.\n\nOn 17 July 2018, BP Iran Limited terminated its lease of an office in Tehran. The office had been used for administrative activities. In 2021, taxes with an aggregate US dollar equivalent value of approximately $1,600 were paid from a bp trust account held with Tadvin Co. to Iranian public entities. No gross revenues or net profits were attributable to these activities.\n\n## Material contracts\n\nOn 4 April 2016 the district court approved the Consent Decree among BP Exploration & Production Inc., BP Corporation North America Inc., BP p.l.c., the United States and the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas (the Gulf states) which fully and finally resolved any and all natural resource damages (NRD) claims of the United States, the Gulf states, and their respective natural resource trustees and all Clean\n\n## Additional disclosures Additional disclosures\n\nWater Act (CWA) penalty claims, and certain other claims of the United States and the Gulf states.\n\nConcurrently, the definitive Settlement Agreement that bp entered into with the Gulf states (Settlement Agreement) with respect to State claims for economic, property and other losses became effective.\n\nbp has filed the Consent Decree and the Settlement Agreement as exhibits to its Annual Report on Form 20-F 2020 filed with the SEC. For further details of the Consent Decree and the Settlement Agreement, see Legal proceedings in bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 .\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nbp has freehold and leasehold interests in real estate and other tangible assets in numerous countries, but no individual property is significant to the group as a whole. For more on the significant subsidiaries \u00ab of the group at 31 December 2021 and the group percentage of ordinary share capital see Financial statements - Note 36. For information on significant joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab of the group see Financial statements Notes 15 and 16.\n\n## Related-party transactions\n\nTransactions between the group and its significant joint ventures and associates are summarized in Financial statements - Note 15 and Note 16. In the ordinary course of its business, the group enters into transactions with various organizations with which some of its directors or executive officers are associated. Except as described in this report, the group did not have any material transactions or transactions of an unusual nature with, and did not make loans to, related parties in the period commencing 1 January 2022 to 1 March 2022.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\nIn the US, bp ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The significant differences between bp's corporate governance practices as a UK company and those required by NYSE listing standards for US companies are listed as follows:\n\n## Independence\n\nAs set out on page 92, bp has adopted separate terms of reference for the board and each of its committees as part of its corporate governance framework. The terms of reference for the board and each of its committees were last updated with effect from 3 December 2021. The terms of reference reflect the UK Corporate Governance Code approach to corporate governance. As such, the way in which bp makes determinations of directors' independence djffers from the NYSE approach.\n\nbp's corporate governance framework requires that all non-executive directors be determined by the board to be 'independent in character and judgement and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement'. The bp board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non-executive directors are independent. In doing so, however, the board did not explicitly take into consideration the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE's listing standards.\n\n## Committees\n\nbp has a number of board committees that are broadly comparable in purpose and composition to those required by NYSE rules for domestic US companies. For instance, bp has a remuneration (rather than a compensation) committee. bp also has an audit committee, which NYSE rules require for both US companies and foreign private issuers. These committees are composed solely of non-executive directors whom the board has determined to be independent, in the manner described above.\n\nEach committee operates under its own terms of reference together with a set of terms applicable to all the committees (see the board committee reports on pages 104-115 and 116).\n\nUnder US securities law and the listing standards of the NYSE, bp is required to have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Section 303A.06 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. bp's audit committee complies with these requirements. The bp audit committee does not have direct responsibility\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n361",

Instead, it follows the UK Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance code 2018 by making recommendations to the board on these matters for it to put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM.\n\nOne of the NYSE's additional requirements for the audit committee states that at least one member of the audit committee is to have 'accounting or related financial management expertise'. The board determined that Tushar Morzaria possesses such expertise and also possesses the financial and audit committee experiences set forth in both the UK Corporate Governance Code and SEC rules (see Audit committee report on page 107). Mr Morzaria is the audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F.\n\n## Shareholder approval of equity compensation plans\n\nThe NYSE rules for US companies require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions to those plans. bp complies with UK requirements that are similar to the NYSE rules. The board, however, does not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE's detailed definition of what are considered 'material revisions'.\n\n## Code of ethics\n\nThe NYSE rules require that US companies adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees. bp has adopted a code of conduct, which applies to all employees and members of the board. In addition, bp has adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers as required by the SEC. bp considers that these codes and policies address the matters specified in the NYSE rules for US companies. During 2021, the board adopted a diversity policy, which requires it to encourage a diverse and inclusive working environment in the boardroom, where everyone is accepted, valued and receives fair treatment according to their different needs and situations without discrimination or prejudice.\n\n## Code of ethics\n\nThe company has adopted a code of ethics for its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, svp accounting reporting control (group controller and chief accounting officer) and svp internal audit (group head of audit) whose roles are equivalent to the SEC roles as required by the provisions of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules issued by the SEC. There have been no waivers from the code of ethics relating to any officers. A copy of the code of ethics can be found at bp.com/ codeofethics\n\nbp also has a code of conduct, which is applicable to all employees, officers and members of the board. This was updated (and published) in February 2020.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\n## Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe company maintains 'disclosure controls and procedures', as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports the company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the company's group chief executive and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management, including the group chief executive and chief financial officer, recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within the company, if any, have been detected. Further, in the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the costs and benefits of possible control and\n\n362\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\nprocedure design options. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. As we do not control these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries \u00ab . Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The company's disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet, and management believes that they meet, reasonable assurance standards.\n\nThe company's management, with the participation of the company's group chief executive and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the group chief executive and chief financial officer have concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement of bp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. bp's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the principal executive and financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of bp's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS.\n\nAs of the end of the 2021 fiscal year, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the criteria in the UK Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has determined that bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021 was effective.\n\nThe company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of bp; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of bp's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021 has been audited by Deloitte LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 172 of bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 .\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the group's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by the Form 20-F that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Principal accountant's fees and services\n\nThe audit committee has established policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte LLP, to render audit and certain assurance services. The policies provide for pre-approval by the audit committee of specifically defined audit, audit-related, non-audit and other services that are not prohibited by regulatory or other professional requirements. Deloitte is engaged for these services when its expertise and experience of bp are important. Most of this work is of an audit nature. The committee regularly reviews the policy, including in 2020, when it was updated to reflect changes resulting from the FRC Ethical Standard (December 2019).\n\nUnder the policy, pre-approval is given for specific services within the following categories: i) audit-related services, such those required by law",

For audit related services, the audit committee has a pre-approved aggregate level, within which specific work may be approved by management. Non-audit services are pre-approved for management to authorize per individual engagement, but above a defined level must be approved by the chairman of the audit committee or the full committee. The audit committee has delegated to the chairman of the audit committee authority to approve permitted services provided that the chairman reports any decisions to the committee at its next scheduled meeting. Any proposed service not included in the approved service list must be approved in advance by the audit committee chairman and reported to the committee, or approved by the full audit committee in advance of commencement of the engagement.\n\nThe audit committee evaluates the performance of the auditor each year. The audit fees payable to Deloitte are reviewed by the committee in the context of other global companies for cost effectiveness. The committee keeps under review the scope and results of audit work and the independence and objectivity of the auditor. External regulation and bp policy requires the auditor to rotate its lead audit partner every five years. See Financial statements - Note 35 and Audit committee report on page 107 for details of fees for services provided by the auditor.\n\n## Directors' report information\n\nThis section of bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 forms part of, and includes certain disclosures which are required by law to be included in, the Directors' report.\n\n## Indemnity provisions\n\nIn accordance with BP's Articles of Association, on appointment each director is granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office, to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities were in force throughout the financial year and at the date of this report. In respect of those liabilities for which directors may not be indemnified, the company maintained a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy throughout 2021. During the year, a review of the terms and scope of the policy was undertaken as part of the annual renewal. Although their defence costs may be met, neither the company's indemnity nor insurance provides cover in the event that the director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. Certain subsidiaries \u00ab are trustees of the group's pension schemes. Each director of these subsidiaries is granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of such a subsidiary's activities as a trustee of the pension scheme, to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities were in force throughout the financial year and at the date of this report.\n\n## Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe disclosures in relation to financial risk management objectives and policies, including the policy for hedging, are included in How we manage risk on pages 73-75, Liquidity and capital resources on page 342 and Financial statements - Notes 28 and 29.\n\n## Exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk\n\nThe disclosures in relation to exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk are included in Financial statements - Note 28.\n\n## Important events since the end of the financial year\n\nDisclosures of the particulars of the important events affecting bp which have occurred since the end of the financial year are included in the Strategic report as well as in other places in the Directors' report. In relation to bp's interests in Russia, disclosures are provided throughout this bp Annual Report and Form 20-F including pages 3, 48, 49 and 253.\n\n## Likely future developments in the business\n\nAn indication of the likely future developments in the business of the company is included in the Strategic report.\n\n## Research and development\n\nIndications of our activities in the field of research and development are provided throughout the Strategic report and the Directors' report including examples on pages 14 (developing low carbon, CCS enabled hydrogen in the UK), 15 (innovation across the business), and 60 (impact on technology).

        "page_content": "## Share prices and listings\n\n## Markets and market prices\n\nThe primary market for the company's ordinary shares (trading symbol 'BP.'), 8% cumulative first preference shares (trading symbol 'BP.A') and 9% cumulative second preference shares (trading symbol 'BP.B') is the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The company's ordinary shares are a constituent element of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index.\n\nIn the US, the company's securities are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of ADSs (trading symbol 'BP'), for which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the depositary (the Depositary) and transfer agent. The Depositary's principal office is 383 Madison Avenue, Floor 11, New York, NY, 10179, US. Each ADS represents six ordinary shares. ADSs are evidenced by American depositary receipts (ADRs), which may be issued in either certificated or book entry form.\n\nThe company's ordinary shares are also traded in the form of a global depositary certificate representing the company's ordinary shares on the Frankfurt, Hamburg and Dusseldorf Stock Exchanges.\n\nOn 1 March 2022, 783,059,034 ADSs (equivalent to approximately 4,698,354,204 ordinary shares or some 24.13% of the total issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury) were outstanding and were held by approximately 69,487 ADS holders. Of these, about 68,677 had registered addresses in the US at that date. One of the registered holders of ADSs represents approximately 1,202,389 underlying holders.\n\nOn 1 March 2022, there were approximately 218,411 ordinary shareholders. Of these shareholders, around 1,524 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of some 4,490,916 ordinary shares.\n\nSince a number of the ordinary shares and ADSs were held by brokers and other nominees, the number of holders in the US may not be representative of the number of beneficial holders or their respective country of residence.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe company's current policy is to pay interim dividends on a quarterly basis on its ordinary shares.\n\nIts policy is also to announce dividends for ordinary shares in US dollars and state an equivalent sterling dividend. Dividends on the company's ordinary shares will be paid in sterling and on the company's ADSs in US dollars. The rate of exchange used to determine the sterling amount equivalent is the average of the market exchange rates in London over the three business days prior to the sterling equivalent announcement date. The directors may choose to declare dividends in any currency provided that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company's intention to change its current policy of announcing dividends on ordinary shares in US dollars.\n\nInformation regarding dividends announced and paid by the company on ordinary shares and preference shares is provided in the consolidated Financial statements - Note 9.\n\nA Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) was approved by shareholders in 2010 and was renewed for a further three years at the 2021 AGM. It enabled the company's ordinary shareholders and ADS holders to elect to receive dividends by way of new fully paid ordinary shares (or ADSs in the case of ADS holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip Programme is always subject to the directors' decision to make the Scrip Programme offer available in respect of any particular dividend.\n\nThe company announced on 29 October 2019 and as part of all subsequent quarterly results announcements made since, that the board had suspended the Scrip Programme in respect of those quarterly dividends. The company does not expect to offer a scrip election for the foreseeable future. Ordinary shareholders and ADS holders (subject to certain exceptions) may be able to participate in dividend reinvestment plans. Any decisions with respect to future dividends will be made by the board of BP p.l.c. following the end of each quarter.\n\nFuture dividends will be dependent on future earnings, the financial condition of the group, the Risk factors set out on page 76 and other matters that may affect the business of the group set out in Our strategy on page 12 and in Liquidity and capital resources on page 342.\n\n368\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n\u00ab\n\nThe following table shows dividends announced and paid by the company per ADS for the past five years.\n\n| Dividends per ADS a   | March            |   June |   September | December   | Total           |\n|-----------------------|------------------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| 2017                  | UK pence   48.95 |  46.54 |       45.73 |            | 44.66    185.88 |\n|                       | US cents   60    |  60    |       60    | 60         | 240             |\n| 2018                  | UK pence   43.01 |  44.66 |       47.58 |            | 48.15    183.40 |\n|                       | US cents   60    |  60    |       61.5  | 61.50      | 243             |\n| 2019                  | UK pence   46.43 |  48.39 |       50.09 |            | 46.95    191.86 |\n|                       | US cents   61.50 |  61.5  |       61.5  | 61.50      | 246             |\n| 2020                  | UK pence   48.94 |  50.05 |       24.26 |            | 23.50    146.75 |\n|                       | US cents   63.00 |  63    |       31.5  | 31.50      | 189             |\n| 2021                  | UK pence   22.61 |  22.27 |       23.72 | 24.63      | 92.23           |\n|                       | US cents 31.50   |  31.5  |       32.76 | 32.76      | 129             |\n\nThere are currently no UK foreign exchange controls or restrictions on remittances of dividends on the ordinary shares or on the conduct of the company's operations, other than restrictions applicable to certain countries and persons subject to EU economic sanctions or those sanctions adopted by the UK government which implement resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.\n\n## Shareholder taxation information\n\nThis section describes the material US federal income tax and UK taxation consequences of owning ordinary shares or ADSs to a US holder who holds the ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes. This section does not discuss tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. It also does not apply inter alia to members of special classes of holders some of which may be subject to other rules, including: taxexempt entities, life insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings, holders that, directly or indirectly, hold 10% or more of the company's shares (as measured by voting power or value), holders that hold the shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, holders that purchase or sell the shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for US federal income tax purposes, or holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar. In addition, if a partnership holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership and may not be described fully below.\n\nA US holder is any beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that is for US federal income tax purposes (1) a citizen or resident of the US, (2) a US domestic corporation, (3) an estate whose income is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more US persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\nThis section is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed US Treasury regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and the taxation laws of the UK, all as currently in effect, as well as the income tax convention between the US and the UK that entered into force on 31 March 2003 (the 'Treaty'). These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. This section further assumes that each obligation under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to bp ADSs and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nFor purposes of the Treaty and the estate and gift tax Convention (the 'Estate Tax Convention') and for US federal income tax and UK taxation purposes, a holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will be treated as the owner of the company's ordinary shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of ordinary shares for ADRs and ADRs for ordinary shares generally will",

        "page_content": "not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK taxation other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax, as described below.\n\nInvestors should consult their own tax adviser regarding the US federal, state and local, UK and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances, and in particular whether they are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty in respect of their investment in the shares or ADSs.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\n## UK taxation\n\nUnder current UK taxation law, no withholding tax will be deducted from dividends paid by the company, including dividends paid to US holders. A shareholder that is a company resident for tax purposes in the UK or trading in the UK through a permanent establishment generally will not be taxable in the UK on a dividend it receives from the company. A shareholder who is an individual resident for tax purposes in the UK is subject to UK tax on dividends received from the company, including dividends received under the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for ordinary shareholders, that are in excess of the annual dividend allowance.\n\nFor 2021/22 the dividend allowance is \u00a32,000 which means there is no UK tax due on the first \u00a32,000 of dividends received. Dividends above this level are subject to tax at 7.5% for basic tax payers, 32.5% for higher rate tax payers and 38.1% for additional rate tax payers.\n\nAlthough the first \u00a32,000 of dividend income is not subject to UK income tax, it does not reduce the total income for tax purposes. Dividends within the dividend allowance still count towards basic or higher rate bands, and may therefore affect the rate of tax paid on dividends received in excess of the \u00a32,000 allowance. For instance, if an individual has an annual gross salary of \u00a350,000 and also receives a dividend of \u00a312,000 they will be subject to the following scenario. The individual's personal allowance and the basic rate tax band will be used up by the gross salary. The remaining part of the salary and the whole of the dividend will be subject to tax at the higher rate, although the dividend allowance will reduce the amount of dividend subject to tax. The dividend of \u00a312,000 will be reduced by the dividend allowance of \u00a32,000 leaving taxable dividend income of \u00a310,000. The dividend will be taxed at 32.5% so that the total tax payable on the dividends is \u00a33,250.\n\nHow the shareholder pays the tax arising on the dividend income depends on the amount of dividend income and salary they receive in the tax year. If less than \u00a32,000 they will not need to report anything or pay any tax. If between \u00a32,000 and \u00a310,000, the shareholder can pay what they owe by: contacting the HMRC helpline; asking HMRC to change their tax code the tax will be taken from their wages or pension or through completion of the 'Dividends' section of their self-assessment tax return, where one is already being filed. If over \u00a310,000 they will be required to file a selfassessment tax return and should complete the 'Dividends' section with details of the amounts received.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nA US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross amount of any dividend paid by the company (including dividends paid but reinvested received under the Global Invest Direct (GID) Dividend Reinvestment Plan for ADS holders) out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes). Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to the holder at a preferential rate, provided that the holder has a holding period in the ordinary shares or ADSs of more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meets other holding period requirements. Dividends paid by the company with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be qualified dividend income.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a dividend must be included in income when the US holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations. US ADS holders should consult their own tax adviser regarding the US tax treatment of the dividend fee in respect of dividends. Dividends will be income from sources outside the US and\n\n\u00ab\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n## Shareholder information Shareholder information\n\ngenerally will be 'passive category income' for purposes of computing a US holder's foreign tax credit limitation.\n\nAs noted above in UK taxation, a US holder will not be subject to UK withholding tax. Accordingly, the receipt of a dividend will not entitle the US holder to a foreign tax credit.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution on the ordinary shares that is paid in pounds sterling will be the US dollar value of the pounds sterling payments made, determined at the spot pounds sterling/US dollar rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of whether the payment is, in fact, converted into US dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the pounds sterling dividend payment is distributed to the date the payment is converted into US dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\nDistributions in excess of the company's earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the US holder's basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain, subject to taxation as described in Taxation of capital gains - US federal income taxation section below.\n\nIn addition, the taxation of dividends may be subject to the rules for passive foreign investment companies (PFIC), described below under 'Taxation of capital gains - US federal income taxation'. Distributions made by a PFIC do not constitute qualified dividend income and are not eligible for the preferential tax rate applicable to such income.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\n## UK taxation\n\nA US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect of a gain on the disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs if the US holder is (1) resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom at the date of disposal, (2) if he or she has left the UK for a period not exceeding five complete tax years between the year of departure from and the year of return to the UK and acquired the shares before leaving the UK and was resident in the UK in the previous four out of seven tax years before the year of departure, (3) a US domestic corporation resident in the UK by reason of its business being managed or controlled in the UK or (4) a citizen of the US that carries on a trade or profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency or a corporation that carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK, through a permanent establishment, and that has used, held, or acquired the ordinary shares or ADSs for the purposes of such trade, profession or vocation of such branch, agency or permanent establishment. However, such persons may be entitled to a tax credit against their US federal income tax liability for the amount of UK capital gains tax or UK corporation tax on chargeable gains (as the case may be) that is paid in respect of such gain.\n\nUnder the Treaty, capital gains on dispositions of ordinary shares or ADSs generally will be subject to tax only in the jurisdiction of residence of the relevant holder as determined under both the laws of the UK and the US and as required by the terms of the Treaty.\n\nUnder the Treaty, individuals who are residents of either the UK or the US and who have been residents of the other jurisdiction (the US or the UK, as the case may be) at any time during the six years immediately preceding the relevant disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to tax with respect to capital gains arising from a disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs of the company not only in the jurisdiction of which the holder is resident at the time of the disposition but also in the other jurisdiction.\n\nFor gains on or after 23 June 2010, the UK Capital Gains Tax rate will be dependent on the level of an individual's taxable income. Where total taxable income and gains after all allowable deductions are less than the upper limit of the basic rate income tax band of \u00a337,700 (for 2021/22), the rate of Capital Gains Tax will be 10%. For gains (and any parts of gains) above that limit the rate will be 20%.\n\nFrom 6 April 2008, entitlement to the annual exemption is based on an individual's circumstances (taking into account Domicile status, remittance basis of taxation and number of years in the UK).

        "page_content": "individuals who are entitled to the exemption for 2021/22, this has been set at \u00a312,300. Corporation tax on chargeable gains is levied at 19 per cent for companies from 1 April 2017.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nA US holder who sells or otherwise disposes of ordinary shares or ADSs will recognize a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized on the disposition and the US holder's tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term gain or loss, subject to tax at a preferential rate for a non-corporate US holder, if the US holder's holding period for such ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year. The tax basis of shares acquired through reinvested dividends under the GID Dividend Reinvestment Plan for ADS holders) is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the investment date. The holding period for shares acquired under the plan begins the day after the applicable investment date.\n\nGain or loss from the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nWe do not believe that ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as stock of a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for US federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are treated as a PFIC, unless a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs, any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as capital gain. Instead, a US holder would be treated as if he or she had realized such gain rateably over the holding period for ordinary shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, in addition to which an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year would apply. Certain 'excess distributions' would be similarly treated if we were treated as a PFIC.\n\n## Additional tax considerations\n\n## Scrip Programme\n\nUntil the publication of the 2019 third quarter results, the company had an optional Scrip Programme, wherein holders of bp ordinary shares or ADSs could elect to receive any dividends in the form of new fully paid ordinary shares or ADSs of the company instead of cash. Please consult your tax adviser for the consequences to you.\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nThe Estate Tax Convention applies to inheritance tax. ADSs held by an individual who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US and is not for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the UK will not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual's death or on transfer during the individual's lifetime unless, among other things, the ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment situated in the UK used for the performance of independent personal services. In the exceptional case where ADSs are subject to both inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for tax payable in the US to be credited against tax payable in the UK or for tax paid in the UK to be credited against tax payable in the US, based on priority rules set forth in the Estate Tax Convention.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nThe statements below relate to what is understood to be the current practice of HM Revenue & Customs in the UK under existing law.\n\nProvided that any instrument of transfer is not executed in the UK and remains at all times outside the UK and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the UK, no UK stamp duty is payable on the acquisition or transfer of ADSs. Neither will an agreement to transfer ADSs in the form of ADRs give rise to a liability to stamp duty reserve tax.\n\nPurchases of ordinary shares, as opposed to ADSs, through the CREST system of paperless share transfers will be subject to stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5%. The charge will arise as soon as there is an agreement for the transfer of the shares (or, in the case of a conditional agreement,\n\n370\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n\u00ab\n\nwhen the condition is fulfilled). The stamp duty reserve tax will apply to agreements to transfer ordinary shares even if the agreement is made outside the UK between two non-residents. Purchases of ordinary shares outside the CREST system are subject either to stamp duty at a rate of \u00a35 per \u00a31,000 (or part, unless the stamp duty is less than \u00a35, when no stamp duty is charged), or stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5%. Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax are generally the liability of the purchaser.\n\nA subsequent transfer of ordinary shares to the Depositary's nominee will give rise to further stamp duty at the rate of \u00a31.50 per \u00a3100 (or part) or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 1.5% of the value of the ordinary shares at the time of the transfer. For ADR holders electing to receive ADSs instead of cash, after the 2012 first quarter dividend payment, HM Revenue & Customs no longer seeks to impose 1.5% stamp duty reserve tax on issues of UK shares and securities to non-EU clearance services and depositary receipt systems.\n\n## Major shareholders\n\nThe disclosure of certain major and significant shareholdings in the share capital of the company is governed by the Companies Act 2006, the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) and the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\n## Register of members holding bp ordinary shares as at 31 December 2021\n\n| Range of holdings   | Number of  ordinary shareholders   |   Percentage of  total ordinary  shareholders |   Percentage of  total ordinary  share capital excluding shares held in treasury |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1-200               | 52,023                             |                                         23.65 |                                                                             0.01 |\n| 201-1,000           | 73,188                             |                                         33.27 |                                                                             0.21 |\n| 1,001-10,000        | 82,898                             |                                         37.69 |                                                                             1.34 |\n| 10,001-100,000      | 10,314                             |                                          4.69 |                                                                             1.09 |\n| 100,001-1,000,000   | 874                                |                                          0.4  |                                                                             1.59 |\n| Over 1,000,000 a    | 662                                |                                          0.3  |                                                                            95.76 |\n| Totals              | 219,959                            |                                        100    |                                                                           100    |\n\n## Register of holders of American depositary shares (ADSs) as at 31 December 2021 a\n\n| Range of holdings   | Number of ADS holders   |   Percentage of  total ADS holders |   Percentage of  total ADSs |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1-200               | 41,436                  |                              59.13 |                        0.22 |\n| 201-1,000           | 18,565                  |                              26.49 |                        0.86 |\n| 1,001-10,000        | 9,678                   |                              13.81 |                        2.43 |\n| 10,001-100,000      | 386                     |                               0.55 |                        0.62 |\n| 100,001-1,000,000   | 5                       |                               0.01 |                        0.08 |\n| Over 1,000,000 b    | 2                       |                               0    |                       95.79 |\n| Totals              | 70,072                  |                             100    |                      100    |\n\nAs at 31 December 2021 there were also 1,185 preference shareholders.

A separate notice convening the meeting is distributed to shareholders, which includes an explanation of the items of business to be considered at the meeting.\n\nAll resolutions for which notice has been given will be decided on a poll. Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution for their reappointment is included in the Notice of bp Annual General Meeting 2022 .\n\n## Memorandum and Articles of Association\n\nThe following summarizes certain provisions of the company's Memorandum and Articles of Association and applicable English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the UK Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and the company's Memorandum and Articles of Association. The Memorandum and Articles of Association are available online at bp.com/usefuldocs .\n\nThe company's Articles of Association may be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. At the annual general meeting (AGM) held on 21 May 2018 shareholders voted to adopt new\n\n\u00ab\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n## Shareholder information Shareholder information\n\nArticles of Association to reflect developments in market practice and to provide clarification and additional flexibility where necessary or appropriate.\n\n## Objects and purposes\n\nBP p.l.c. is a public company limited by shares and registered in England and Wales with the registered number 102498. The provisions regulating the operations of the company, known as its 'objects', were historically stated in a company's memorandum. The Act abolished the need to have object provisions and so at the AGM held on 15 April 2010 shareholders approved the removal of its objects clause together with all other provisions of its Memorandum that, by virtue of the Act, are treated as forming part of the company's Articles of Association.\n\n## Directors and secretary\n\nThe business and affairs of the company shall be managed by the directors. The company's Articles of Association provide that any person may be appointed by the existing directors or by the shareholders in a general meeting either as a replacement for another director or as an additional director. Any person appointed by the directors will hold office only until the next general meeting, notice of which is first given after their appointment and will then be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. A director may be removed by the company as provided for by applicable law and shall vacate office in certain circumstances as set out in the Articles of Association. In addition, the company may, by special resolution, remove a director before the expiration of his/her period of office and, subject to the Articles of Association, may by ordinary resolution appoint another person to be a director instead. There is no requirement for a director to retire on reaching any age.\n\nThe Articles of Association place a general prohibition on a director voting in respect of any contract or arrangement in which the director has a material interest other than by virtue of such director's interest in shares in the company. However, in the absence of some other material interest not indicated below, a director is entitled to vote and to be counted in a quorum for the purpose of any vote relating to a resolution concerning the following matters:\n\n- \u00b7 The giving of security or indemnity with respect to any money lent or obligation taken by the director at the request or benefit of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n- \u00b7 The giving of security or indemnity to a third party with respect to any debt or obligation of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which the director has assumed responsibility.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal in which the director is interested, concerning the underwriting of company securities or debentures or the giving of any security to a third party for a debt or obligation of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning any other company in which the director is interested, directly or indirectly (whether as an officer or shareholder or otherwise) provided that the director and persons connected with such director are not the holder or holders of 1% or more of the voting interest in the shares of such company.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning the purchase or maintenance of any insurance policy under which the director may benefit.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning the giving to the director of any other indemnity which is on substantially the same terms as indemnities given or to be given to all of the other directors or to the funding by the company of his expenditure on defending proceedings or the doing by the company of anything to enable the director to avoid incurring such expenditure where all other directors have been given or are to be given substantially the same arrangements.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning an arrangement for the benefit of the employees and directors or former employees and former directors of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, including but without being limited to a retirement benefits scheme and an employees' share scheme, which does not accord to any director any privilege or advantage not generally accorded to the employees or former employees to whom the arrangement relates.\n\nThe Act requires a director of a company who is in any way interested in a contract or proposed contract with the company to declare the nature of\n\n371",

        "page_content": "the director's interest at a meeting of the directors of the company. The definition of 'interest' includes the interests of spouses, children, companies and trusts. The Act also requires that a director must avoid a situation where a director has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the company's interests. The Act allows directors of public companies to authorize such conflicts where appropriate, if a company's Articles of Association so permit. The company's Articles of Association permit the authorization of such conflicts. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, except that the amount remaining undischarged of all moneys borrowed by the company shall not, without approval of the shareholders, exceed two times the amount paid up on the share capital plus the aggregate of the amount of the capital and revenue reserves of the company and its subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the United Kingdom. Variation of the borrowing power of the board may only be affected by amending the Articles of Association.\n\nRemuneration of non-executive directors shall be determined in the aggregate by resolution of the shareholders. Remuneration of executive directors is determined by the remuneration committee. This committee is made up of non-executive directors only. There is no requirement of share ownership for a director's qualification.\n\nThe Articles of Association provide entitlement to the directors' pensions and death and disability benefits to the directors' relations and dependants respectively.\n\nThe circumstances in which a director's office will automatically terminate include, amongst others: when a director ceases to hold an executive office of the company and the directors resolve that they should cease to be a director; if a medical practitioner provides an opinion that a director has become incapable of acting as a director and may remain so incapable for more than a further three months and the directors resolve that they should cease to be a director; and if all of the other directors vote in favour of a resolution stating that the person should cease to be a director.\n\nThe company secretary has express powers to delegate any of the powers or discretions conferred on him or her.\n\n## Dividend rights; other rights to share in company profits; capital calls\n\nShareholders of the company may, by resolution, declare dividends but no such dividend may be declared in excess of the amount recommended by the directors. The directors may also pay interim dividends without obtaining shareholder approval. No dividend may be paid other than out of profits available for distribution, as determined under IFRS and the Act. Dividends on ordinary shares are payable only after payment of dividends on bp preference shares. Any dividend unclaimed after a period of 10 years from the date of declaration of such dividend shall be forfeited and reverts to bp. If the company exercises its right to forfeit shares and sells shares belonging to an untraced shareholder then any entitlement to claim dividends or other monies unclaimed in respect of those shares will be for a period of twelve months after the sale. The company may take such steps as the directors decide are appropriate in the circumstances to trace the member entitled and the sale may be made at such time and on such terms as the directors may decide.\n\nThe directors have the power to declare and pay dividends in any currency provided that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company's intention to change its current policy of paying dividends in US dollars. At the company's AGM held on 15 April 2010, shareholders approved the introduction of a Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) and to include provisions in the Articles of Association to enable the company to operate the Scrip Programme. The Scrip Programme was renewed at the company's AGM held on 12 May 2021 for a further three years. The Scrip Programme enables ordinary shareholders and bp ADS holders to elect to receive new fully paid ordinary shares (or bp ADSs in the case of bp ADS holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip Programme is always subject to the directors' decision to make the scrip offer available in respect of any particular dividend. Should the directors decide not to offer the scrip in respect of any particular dividend, cash will automatically be paid instead. The directors may determine in relation to any scrip dividend plan or programme how the costs of the programme will be met, the minimum number of ordinary shares required in order to be able to participate in the programme and any arrangements to deal with legal and practical difficulties in any particular territory.\n\n372\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n\u00ab\n\nApart from shareholders' rights to share in bp's profits by dividend (if any is declared or announced), the Articles of Association provide that the directors may set aside:\n\n- \u00b7 A special reserve fund out of the balance of profits each year to make up any deficit of cumulative dividend on the bp preference shares.\n- \u00b7 A general reserve out of the balance of profits each year, which shall be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the company may properly be applied. This may include capitalization of such sum, pursuant to an ordinary shareholders' resolution, and distribution to shareholders as if it were distributed by way of a dividend on the ordinary shares or in paying up in full unissued ordinary shares for allotment and distribution as bonus shares.\n\nAny such sums so deposited may be distributed in accordance with the manner of distribution of dividends as described above.\n\nHolders of shares are not subject to calls on capital by the company, provided that the amounts required to be paid on issue have been paid off. All shares are fully paid.\n\n## Share transfers and share certificates\n\nThe directors may permit transfers to be effected other than by an instrument in writing. Share certificates will not be required to be issued by the company if they are not required by law.\n\nThe company may charge an administrative fee in the event that a shareholder wishes to replace two or more certificates representing shares with a single certificate or wishes to surrender a single certificate and replace it with two or more certificates. All certificates are sent at the member's risk.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nThe Articles of Association of the company provide that voting on resolutions at a shareholders' meeting will be decided on a poll other than resolutions of a procedural nature, which may be decided on a show of hands. If voting is on a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every ordinary share held and two votes for every \u00a35 in nominal amount of bp preference shares held. If voting is on a show of hands, each shareholder who is present at the meeting in person or whose duly appointed proxy is present in person will have one vote, regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is requested.\n\nShareholders do not have cumulative voting rights.\n\nFor the purposes of determining which persons are entitled to attend or vote at a shareholders' meeting and how many votes such persons may cast, the company may specify in the notice of the meeting a time, not more than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, by which a person who holds shares in registered form must be entered on the company's register of members in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting or to appoint a proxy to do so.\n\nHolders on record of ordinary shares may appoint a proxy, including a beneficial owner of those shares, to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at any shareholders' meeting, provided that a duly completed proxy form is received not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the directors may determine) before the time of the meeting or adjourned meeting or, where the poll is to be taken after the date of the meeting, not less than 24 hours (or such shorter time as the directors may determine) before the time of the poll.\n\nRecord holders of bp ADSs are also entitled to attend, speak and vote at any shareholders' meeting of the company by the appointment by the approved depositary, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., of them as proxies in respect of the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Each such proxy may also appoint a proxy. Alternatively, holders of bp ADSs are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the depositary, who will vote the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.\n\nProxies may be delivered electronically.\n\nCorporations who are members of the company may appoint one or more persons to act as their representative or representatives at any shareholders' meeting provided that the company may require a corporate representative to produce a certified copy of the resolution appointing them before they are permitted to exercise their powers.",

        "page_content": "Matters are transacted at shareholders' meetings by the proposing and passing of resolutions, of which there are two types: ordinary or special.\n\nAn ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of those persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum. Any AGM requires 21 clear days' notice. The notice period for any other general meeting is 14 clear days subject to the company obtaining annual shareholder approval, failing which, a 21 clear day notice period will apply.\n\n## Liquidation rights; redemption provisions\n\nIn the event of a liquidation of bp, after payment of all liabilities and applicable deductions under UK laws and subject to the payment of secured creditors, the holders of bp preference shares would be entitled to the sum of (1) the capital paid up on such shares plus, (2) accrued and unpaid dividends and (3) a premium equal to the higher of (a) 10% of the capital paid up on the bp preference shares and (b) the excess of the average market price over par value of such shares on the LSE during the previous six months. The remaining assets (if any) would be divided pro rata among the holders of ordinary shares.\n\nWithout prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any class of shares, bp may issue any share with such preferred, deferred or other special rights, or subject to such restrictions as the shareholders by resolution determine (or, in the absence of any such resolutions, by determination of the directors), and may issue shares that are to be or may be redeemed.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nThe rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the consent in writing of holders of 75% of the shares of that class or on the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles of Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum with respect to a meeting to change the rights attached to the preference shares is 10% or more of the shares of that class, and the quorum to change the rights attached to the ordinary shares is one third or more of the shares of that class.\n\n## Shareholders' meetings and notices\n\nShareholders must provide bp with a postal or electronic address in the UK to be entitled to receive notice of shareholders' meetings. Holders of bp ADSs are entitled to receive notices under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to bp ADSs. The substance and timing of notices are described above under the heading Voting rights.\n\nUnder the Act, the AGM of shareholders must be held once every year, within each six month period beginning with the day following the company's accounting reference date. All general meetings shall be held at a time and place determined by the directors. If any shareholders' meeting is adjourned for lack of quorum, notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting may be given in any lawful manner, including electronically. Powers exist for action to be taken either before or at the meeting by authorized officers to ensure its orderly conduct and safety of those attending.\n\nThe directors have power to convene a general meeting which is a hybrid meeting, that is to provide facilities for shareholders to attend a meeting which is being held at a physical place by electronic means as well (but not to convene a purely electronic meeting).\n\nThe provisions of the Articles of Association in relation to satellite meetings permit facilities being provided by electronic means to allow those persons at each place to participate in the meeting.\n\n## Limitations on voting and shareholding\n\nThere are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the company's Articles of Association, restricting the right of non-resident or foreign owners to hold or vote bp ordinary or preference shares in the company other than limitations that would generally apply to all of the shareholders and limitations applicable to certain countries and persons subject to EU economic sanctions or those sanctions adopted by the UK government which implement resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.\n\n\u00ab\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n## Shareholder information Shareholder information\n\n## Disclosure of interests in shares\n\nThe Act permits a public company to give notice to any person whom the company believes to be or, at any time during the three years prior to the issue of the notice, to have been interested in its voting shares requiring them to disclose certain information with respect to those interests. Failure to supply the information required may lead to disenfranchisement of the relevant shares and a prohibition on their transfer and receipt of dividends and other payments in respect of those shares and any new shares in the company issued in respect of those shares. In this context the term 'interest' is widely defined and will generally include an interest of any kind whatsoever in voting shares, including any interest of a holder of bp ADSs.\n\n## Called-up share capital\n\nDetails of the allotted, called-up and fully-paid share capital at 31 December 2021 are set out in Financial statements - Note 30. In accordance with institutional investor guidelines, the company deems it appropriate to grant authority to the directors to allot shares and other securities and to disapply pre-emption rights by way of shareholders' resolutions at each AGM in place of authority granted by virtue of the company's Articles of Association. At the AGM on 12 May 2021, authorization was given to the directors to allot shares in the company and to grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any security into, shares in the company up to an aggregate nominal amount as set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting 2021. These authorities were given for the period until the next AGM in 2022 or 12 August 2022, whichever is the earlier. These authorities are renewed annually at the AGM.\n\n## Company records and service of notice\n\nIn relation to notices not covered by the Act, the reference to notice by advertisement in a national newspaper also includes advertisements via other means such as a public announcement.\n\n373",

        "page_content": "## Purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers\n\nIn April 2021, having reached its net debt target of $35 billion, the company began a series of share buyback programmes, announcing to purchase around $4.15 billion of shares from surplus cash flow generated in 2021. In addition, to reduce the issued share capital of the company to offset the expected full-year dilution from the vesting of awards under employee share schemes two programmes were announced to purchase around $1.0 billion of shares.

Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties, Twenty-First Session, Adoption of the Paris Agreement, U.N. Doc. FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1 (Dec. 12, 2015).\n\n## New material capex investment\n\nFor the purposes of the 2021 evaluation discussed on pages 32-36, 'new material capex investment' means a decision taken by the resource commitment meeting (RCM) in 2021 to incur inorganic or organic investments greater than $250 million that relate to a new project or asset, extending an existing project or asset, or acquiring or increasing a share in a project, asset or entity.\n\nThere were three investments that met the above criteria in 2021.\n\n## Material capex evaluation: Paris-consistency quantitative tests.\n\nFor the purposes of evaluating material capex investments for consistency with the Paris goals, two quantitative tests were applied, see page 36.\n\n## Operational carbon intensity (CI)\n\nThe annual average operational GHG emissions (TeCO2e/unit), divided by the relevant unit of output:\n\n- \u00b7 per thousand barrels of oil equivalent in upstream\n- \u00b7 per utilized equivalent distillation capacity in refining\n- \u00b7 per thousand tonnes of petrochemicals production.\n\n378\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n## Net zero aims and ambition glossary\n\n## Energy product\n\nAn energy product is a product that is used by an ultimate end user to satisfy an energy demand. In the case of fuels, to burn them to release their calorific content, and in the case of electricity to provide work or heat. A refined product such as a lubricant base stock does not count as an energy product as it is not used to provide energy in its use phase. Crude oil does not count as an energy product except in the rare cases where it is used by an end user to satisfy energy demand.\n\n## Emissions from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production\n\nEstimated CO2 emissions from the combustion of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) based on bp's net share of production, excluding bp's share of Rosneft production and assuming that all produced volumes undergo full stoichiometric combustion to CO2.\n\n## Methane intensity\n\nMethane intensity refers to the amount of methane emissions from bp's operated upstream oil and gas assets as a percentage of the total gas that goes to market from those operations. Our methodology is aligned with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative's (OGCI).\n\n## Net zero\n\nReferences to global net zero in the phrase, 'to help the world get to net zero', means achieving '...a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases...on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty', as set out in Article 4(1) of the Paris Agreement.\n\nReferences to net zero for bp in the context of our ambition and aims 1, 2 and 3 mean achieving a balance between (a) the relevant Scope 1 and 2 emissions (for aim 1), Scope 3 emissions (for aim 2) or product lifecycle emissions (for aim 3) and (b) the aggregate of applicable deductions from qualifying activities such as sinks under our methodology at the applicable time.\n\n## Net zero \u00ab operations\n\nbp's aim to reach net zero operational greenhouse gas (CO2 and methane) emissions by 2050 or sooner, on a gross operational control basis, in accordance with bp's aim 1 which relates to our reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp's aim 1 is defined in terms of absolute reductions relative to the baseline year of 2019.\n\n## Net zero \u00ab production\n\nbp's aim to reach net zero CO2 emissions, in accordance with bp's aim 2, from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production, in respect of the estimated CO2 emissions from the combustion of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (based on bp's net share of production, excluding bp's share of Rosneft production and assuming that all produced volumes undergo full stoichiometric combustion to CO2). Aim 2 is bp's Scope 3 aim and relates to Scope 3 category 11 emissions. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp's aim 2 is defined in terms of absolute reductions relative to the baseline year of 2019.\n\n## Net zero \u00ab sales\n\nbp's aim to reach net zero for the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell \u00ab , in accordance with bp's aim 3. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp's aim 3 is defined in terms of reductions in the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell (in grams CO2e/MJ) relative to the baseline year of 2019. (Work is ongoing to confirm an assured baseline for this aim to incorporate the inclusion of physically traded energy products).\n\n## Physically traded energy product\n\nFor the purposes of aim 3, this includes trades in energy products \u00ab which are physically settled in circumstances where bp considers their inclusion to be consistent with the intent of the aim. It therefore excludes, for example, financial trades, and physical trades where the purpose or effect is that the volumes traded net off against each other.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable emissions reductions (SER)\n\nSERs result from actions or interventions that have led to ongoing reductions in Scope 1 (direct) and/or Scope 2 (indirect) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and methane) such that GHG emissions would have been higher in the reporting year if the intervention had not taken place. SERs must meet three criteria: a specific intervention that has reduced GHG emissions, the reduction must be quantifiable and the reduction is expected to be ongoing. Reductions are reportable for a 12month period from the start of the intervention/action.\n\n## Adjusted EBIDA\n\nAdjusted EBIDA is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as profit or loss for the period, adjusting for finance costs and net finance expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits and taxation, inventory holding gains or losses before tax, adjusting items \u00ab before interest and tax, and taxation on an underlying RC basis, and adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization (pre-tax) and exploration expenditure writtenoff (net of adjusting items, pre-tax). bp believes that adjusted EBIDA is a useful measure for investors because it is a measure closely tracked by management to evaluate bp's operating performance and to make financial, strategic and operating decisions and because it may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation of profit or loss for the period to adjusted EBIDA is provided on page 387.\n\n## Adjusted EBIDA per share compound annual growth rate (CAGR)\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBIDA per share is calculated based on the shares in issue at period end.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure presented for bp's operating segments and is defined as replacement cost (RC) profit before interest and tax, excluding net adjusting items, adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration write-offs (net of adjusting items). Adjusted EBITDA by business is a further analysis of adjusted EBITDA for the customers & products businesses. bp believes it is helpful to disclose adjusted EBITDA by operating segment and by business because it reflects how the segments measure underlying business delivery. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the segment is RC profit or loss before interest and tax, which is bp's measure of profit or loss that is required to be disclosed for each operating segment under IFRS. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on pages 354 and 388.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the group is defined as profit or loss for the period before finance costs and net finance expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, adjusting for inventory holding gains or losses before tax, adjusting items before interest and tax, and adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization (pre-tax) and exploration expenditure written-off (net of adjusting items, pre-tax). The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the group is profit or loss for the period.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for adjusted EBITDA for the group, strategic themes or transition growth businesses, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses, adjusting items and exploration expenditure written off that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n## Adjusting items\n\nAdjusting items are items that bp discloses separately because it considers such disclosures to be meaningful and relevant to investors. They are items that management considers to be important to period-onperiod analysis of the group's results and are disclosed in order to enable investors to better understand and evaluate the group's reported financial performance. Adjusting items include gains and losses on the sale of businesses and fixed assets, impairments, environmental and other provisions, restructuring, integration and rationalization costs, fair value accounting effects, costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and other\n\nitems. Adjusting items within equity-accounted earnings are reported net of incremental income tax reported by the equity-accounted entity. Adjusting items are used as a reconciling adjustment to derive underlying RC profit or loss and related underlying measures which are non-GAAP measures. An analysis of adjusting items by segment and type is shown on page 339. Prior to 2021 adjusting items were reported under two different headings - non-operating items and fair value accounting effects.\n\n## Associate\n\nAn entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the group. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\n## Bioenergy production\n\nBioenergy production is average thousands of barrels of biofuel production per day during the period covered, net to bp. This includes equivalent ethanol production, bp Bunge biopower for grid export, biogas and refining co-processing and standalone hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO).\n\n## Bio-refinery\n\nA facility that is dedicated to processing biological materials (including waste oil and crop waste) to produce biofuels such as bio-diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, which may be blended to customer specifications with other components such as hydrocarbons at co-located or adjacent terminals and tanks.\n\n## Blue hydrogen\n\nHydrogen produced by reforming of natural gas or gasification of coal, with CO2 captured and stored (CCS).\n\n## Capital employed\n\nNon-GAAP measure. It is defined as total equity plus finance debt.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nTotal cash capital expenditure as stated in the group cash flow statement. Capital expenditure for the operating segments and customers & products businesses is presented on the same basis.\n\n## Carbon intensity of the energy products we sell\n\nThe weighted average GHG (CO2, methane, N2O) emissions per unit of energy delivered (in grams CO2e/MJ) estimated in respect of marketed sales of energy products \u00ab and sales of physically traded energy products \u00ab . GHG emissions are estimated on a lifecycle basis covering production extraction, transportation, processing, distribution and use of the relevant products (assuming, where the energy product is a fuel for combustion, full stoichiometric combustion of the product to CO2).\n\n## Cash balance point\n\nCash balance point is defined as the implied Brent oil price for the quarter that would cause the sum of operating cash flow excluding Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments (assuming actual refining marker margins and Henry Hub gas prices for the quarter) and proceeds from loan repayments to equate to the sum of total cash capital expenditure, lease liability payments, dividend paid, and payments on perpetual hybrid bonds.\n\n## Cash costs\n\nCash costs is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as production and manufacturing expenses plus distribution and administration expenses and excludes costs that are classified as adjusting items and costs that are variable, primarily with volumes (such as freight costs). It also includes exploration geological and geophysical costs, which are included in the exploration expenses line in the group income statement. Management believes that cash costs is a performance measure that provides investors with useful information regarding the company's financial performance because it considers these expenses to be the principal operating and overhead expenses that are most directly under their control although they also include certain foreign exchange and commodity price effects.\n\n## Castrol sales and other operating revenues\n\nCastrol sales and other operating revenues, are sales and other operating revenues generated by our Castrol business.\n\n## Commodity trading contracts\n\nbp participates in regional and global commodity trading markets in order to manage, transact and hedge the crude oil, refined products and natural\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n379",

        "page_content": "gas that the group either produces or consumes in its manufacturing operations. The range of contracts the group enters into in its commodity trading operations is described below. Using these contracts, in combination with rights to access storage and transportation capacity, allows the group to access advantageous pricing differences between locations, time periods and grades.\n\n## Exchange-traded commodity derivatives\n\nContracts that are typically in the form of futures and options traded on a recognized exchange, such as Nymex and ICE. Such contracts are traded in standard specifications for the main marker crude oils, such as Brent and West Texas Intermediate; the main product grades, such as gasoline and gasoil; and for natural gas and power. Gains and losses, otherwise referred to as variation margin, are generally settled on a daily basis with the relevant exchange. These contracts are used for the trading and risk management of crude oil, refined products, and natural gas and power. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on exchange-traded commodity derivatives are included in sales and other operating revenues for accounting purposes.\n\n## Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts\n\nContracts that are typically in the form of forwards, swaps and options. Some of these contracts are traded bilaterally between counterparties or through brokers, others may be cleared by a central clearing counterparty. These contracts can be used both for trading and risk management activities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on OTC contracts are included in sales and other operating revenues for accounting purposes. Many grades of crude oil bought and sold use standard contracts including US domestic light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as West Texas Intermediate, and a standard North Sea crude blend - Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk (BFOE). Forward contracts are used in connection with the purchase of crude oil supplies for refineries and for marketing and sales of the group's oil production and refined products. The contracts typically contain standard delivery and settlement terms. These transactions call for physical delivery of oil with consequent operational and price risk. However, various means exist and are used from time to time, to settle obligations under the contracts in cash rather than through physical delivery. Physically settled BFOE contracts delivered by cargo additionally specify a standard volume and tolerance.\n\nGas and power OTC markets are highly developed in North America and the UK, where commodities can be bought and sold for delivery in future periods. These contracts are negotiated between two parties to purchase and sell gas and power at a specified price, with delivery and settlement at a future date. Typically, the contracts specify delivery terms for the underlying commodity. Some of these transactions are not settled physically as they can be net settled by transacting offsetting sale or purchase contracts for the same location and delivery period. The contracts contain standard terms such as delivery point, pricing mechanism, settlement terms and specification of the commodity. Typically, volume, price and term (e.g. daily, monthly and balance of month) are the main variable contract terms.\n\nSwaps are typically contractual obligations to exchange cash flows between two parties. A typical swap transaction usually references a floating price and a fixed price with the net difference of the cash flows being settled. Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell crude, oil products, natural gas or power at a specified price on or before a specific future date. Amounts under these derivative financial instruments are settled at expiry. Typically, netting agreements are used to limit credit exposure and support liquidity.\n\n## Spot and term contracts\n\nSpot contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at the market price prevailing on or around the delivery date when title to the inventory is taken. Term contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at regular intervals over an agreed term. Though spot and term contracts may have a standard form, there is no offsetting mechanism in place. As such, these transactions result in physical delivery with operational and price risk. Spot and term contracts typically relate to purchases of crude for a refinery, products for marketing, or third-party natural gas, or sales of the group's oil production, oil products or gas production to third parties. For accounting purposes, spot and term sales are included in sales and other operating revenues when title\n\n380\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\npasses. Similarly, spot and term purchases are included in purchases for accounting purposes.\n\n## Consolidation adjustment - UPII\n\nUnrealized profit in inventory arising on inter-segment transactions.\n\n## Convenience gross margin\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Convenience gross margin is calculated as RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment, excluding RC profit before interest and tax for the refining & trading and petrochemicals businesses, and adjusting items \u00ab (as defined above) for the convenience & mobility business to derive underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the convenience & mobility business; subtracting underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the Castrol business; adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization, production and manufacturing, distribution and administration expenses for convenience & mobility (excluding Castrol); subtracting earnings from equity-accounted entities in the convenience & mobility business (excluding Castrol) and gross margin for the retail fuels, next-gen (such as electrification), aviation, B2B and midstream businesses.\n\n## Convenience, retail fuels and electrification gross margin\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Convenience, retail fuels and electrification gross margin is calculated as RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment, excluding RC profit before interest and tax for the refining & trading and petrochemicals businesses, and adjusting items \u00ab (as defined above) for the convenience & mobility business to derive underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the convenience & mobility business; subtracting underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the Castrol business; adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization, production and manufacturing, distribution and administration expenses for convenience & mobility (excluding Castrol); subtracting earnings from equity-accounted entities in the convenience & mobility business (excluding Castrol) and gross margin for aviation, B2B and midstream businesses. Margin share for convenience and electrification is the ratio of convenience and electrification gross margin to total gross margin for convenience, retail fuels and electrification.\n\nbp believes it is helpful to disclose the margin share from convenience and electrification because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same way as management, our progress against our strategic objectives of convenience growth and scaling up our next-gen mobility solutions (such as electrification). The nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator are RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 354.\n\nWe are unable to present forward-looking information of the nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator for margin share for convenience and electrification, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses, that is difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n## Cumulative cash costs reductions\n\nNon-GAAP measure. See cash costs definition above. Cumulative cash cost reductions in 2021 compared to 2019, as applicable to the directors' remuneration performance measure, are further defined as 2021 exit rate, less agreed portfolio changes and costs in direct support of growth and costs in direct support of growth compared to 2019 baseline.\n\n## Customer touchpoints\n\nCustomer touchpoints are the number of retail customer transactions per day on bp forecourts globally. These include transactions involving fuel and/or convenience across all channels of trade.\n\n## Developed renewables to final investment decision (FID)\n\nTotal generating capacity for assets developed to FID by all entities where bp has an equity share (proportionate to equity share). If asset is subsequently sold bp will continue to record capacity as developed to FID. If bp equity share increases developed capacity to FID will increase proportionately to share increase for any assets where bp held equity at the point of FID.\n\n## Divestment proceeds\n\nDisposal proceeds as per the group cash flow statement.",

The ETR on RC profit or loss is calculated by dividing taxation on a RC basis by RC profit or loss before tax. Taxation on a RC basis for the group is calculated as taxation as stated on the group income statement adjusted for taxation on inventory holding gains and losses. Information on RC profit or loss is provided below. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the ETR on RC profit or loss because this measure excludes the impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories and allows for more meaningful comparisons between reporting periods. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 386.\n\n## Electric vehicle charge points / EV charge points\n\nDefined as the number of connectors on a charging device, operated by either bp or a bp joint venture.\n\n## Fair value accounting effects\n\nNon-GAAP adjustments to our IFRS profit or loss. They reflect the difference between the way bp manages the economic exposure and internally measures performance of certain activities and the way those activities are measured under IFRS. Fair value accounting effects are included within adjusting items. They relate to certain of the group's commodity, interest rate and currency risk exposures as detailed below. Other than as noted below, the fair value accounting effects described are reported in both the gas & low carbon energy and customer & products segments.\n\nbp uses derivative instruments to manage the economic exposure relating to inventories above normal operating requirements of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Under IFRS, these inventories are recorded at historical cost. The related derivative instruments, however, are required to be recorded at fair value with gains and losses recognized in the income statement. This is because hedge accounting is either not permitted or not followed, principally due to the impracticality of effectiveness-testing requirements. Therefore, measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses occur. Gains and losses on these inventories, other than net realizable value provisions, are not recognized until the commodity is sold in a subsequent accounting period. Gains and losses on the related derivative commodity contracts are recognized in the income statement, from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into, on a fair value basis using forward prices consistent with the contract maturity.\n\nbp enters into physical commodity contracts to meet certain business requirements, such as the purchase of crude for a refinery or the sale of bp's gas production. Under IFRS these physical contracts are treated as derivatives and are required to be fair valued when they are managed as part of a larger portfolio of similar transactions. Gains and losses arising are recognized in the income statement from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into.\n\nIFRS require that inventory held for trading is recorded at its fair value using period-end spot prices, whereas any related derivative commodity instruments are required to be recorded at values based on forward prices consistent with the contract maturity. Depending on market conditions, these forward prices can be either higher or lower than spot prices, resulting in measurement differences.\n\nbp enters into contracts for pipelines and other transportation, storage capacity, oil and gas processing, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and certain gas and power contracts that, under IFRS, are recorded on an accruals basis. These contracts are risk-managed using a variety of derivative instruments that are fair valued under IFRS. This results in measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses.\n\nThe way that bp manages the economic exposures described above, and measures performance internally, differs from the way these activities are measured under IFRS. bp calculates this difference for consolidated entities by comparing the IFRS result with management's internal measure of performance. Under management's internal measure of performance the inventory, transportation and capacity contracts in question are valued based on fair value using relevant forward prices prevailing at the end of the period. The fair values of derivative\n\ninstruments used to risk manage certain oil, gas, power and other contracts, are deferred to match with the underlying exposure and the commodity contracts for business requirements are accounted for on an accruals basis. We believe that disclosing management's estimate of this difference provides useful information for investors because it enables investors to see the economic effect of these activities as a whole.\n\nFair value accounting effects also include changes in the fair value of the near-term portions of LNG contracts that fall within bp's risk management framework. LNG contracts are not considered derivatives, because there is insufficient market liquidity, and they are therefore accrual accounted under IFRS. However, oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments (used to risk manage the near-term portions of the LNG contracts) are fair valued under IFRS. The fair value accounting effect, which is reported in the gas and low carbon energy segment, reduces the measurement differences between that of the derivative financial instruments used to risk manage the LNG contracts and the measurement of the LNG contracts themselves, which therefore gives a better representation of performance in each period.\n\nIn addition, from 2020 fair value accounting effects include changes in the fair value of derivatives entered into by the group to manage currency exposure and interest rate risks relating to hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The hybrid bonds which were issued on 17 June 2020 are classified as equity instruments and were recorded in the balance sheet at that date at their USD equivalent issued value. Under IFRS these equity instruments are not remeasured from period to period, and do not qualify for application of hedge accounting. The derivative instruments relating to the hybrid bonds, however, are required to be recorded at fair value with mark to market gains and losses recognized in the income statement. Therefore, measurement differences in relation to the recognition of gains and losses occur. The fair value accounting effect, which is reported in the other businesses & corporate segment, eliminates the fair value gains and losses of these derivative financial instruments that are recognized in the income statement. We believe that this gives a better representation of performance, by more appropriately reflecting the economic effect of these risk management activities, in each period.\n\n## Finance debt ratio\n\nFinance debt ratio is defined as the ratio of finance debt to the total of finance debt plus total equity.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nOperating cash flow less net cash used in investing activities and lease liability payments included in financing activities, as presented in the group cash flow statement. Free cash flow excluding Deepwater Horizon costs, as applicable to the directors' remuneration performance measure, is defined as free cash flow excluding post-tax operating cash flows relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, adjusting for other proceeds reported within financing activities in the group cash flow statement and movements in lease creditor.\n\n## Gearing and net debt\n\nNon-GAAP measures. Net debt is calculated as finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt does not include accrued interest, which is reported within other receivables and other payables on the balance sheet and for which the associated cash flows are presented as operating cash flows in the group cash flow statement. Gearing is defined as the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings 'Derivative financial instruments'. See Financial statements Note 26 for information on finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure to net debt on an IFRS basis. The nearest equivalent GAAP measure to gearing on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for net debt or gearing to finance debt and total equity, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n381",

Net debt including leases is calculated as net debt plus lease liabilities, less the net amount of partner receivables and payables relating to leases entered into on behalf of joint operations. Gearing including leases is defined as the ratio of net debt including leases to the total of net debt including leases plus total equity. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors as they enable investors to understand the impact of the group's lease portfolio on net debt and gearing. See Financial statements - Note 26 for information on finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure to net debt including leases on an IFRS basis. The nearest equivalent GAAP measure to gearing including leases on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio.

Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent at 5.8 billion cubic feet = 1 million barrels.\n\n## Inorganic capital expenditure\n\nA subset of capital expenditure on a cash basis and is a non-GAAP measure. Inorganic capital expenditure comprises consideration in business combinations and certain other significant investments made by the group. It is reported on a cash basis. bp believes that this measure provides useful information as it allows investors to understand how bp's management invests funds in projects which expand the group's activities through acquisition. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is capital expenditure on a cash basis. Further information and a reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 338.\n\n## Inventory holding gains and losses\n\nInventory holding gains and losses are non-GAAP adjustments to our IFRS profit (loss) and represent:\n\n- a. the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out (FIFO) method after adjusting for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost. Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting of inventories other than for trading inventories, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income. The amounts disclosed as inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis (after adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions) and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory. For this purpose, the replacement cost of inventory is calculated using data from each operation's production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach; and\n- b. an adjustment relating to certain trading inventories that are not price risk managed which relate to a minimum inventory volume that is required to be held to maintain underlying business activities. This adjustment represents the movement in fair value of the inventories due to prices, on a grade by grade basis, during the period. This is calculated from each operation's inventory management system on a monthly basis using the discrete monthly movement in market prices for these inventories.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n382\n\nThe amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss. No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions that are price risk-managed. See Replacement cost (RC) profit or loss definition below.\n\n## Joint arrangement\n\nAn arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control.\n\n## Joint control\n\nContractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\n## Joint operation\n\nA joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\n## Joint venture\n\nA joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\n## Liquids\n\nComprises crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. For the oil production & operations segment, it also includes bitumen.\n\n## LNG portfolio\n\nLNG portfolio refers to bp group's LNG equity production plus additional long-term merchant LNG volumes.\n\n## LNG train\n\nAn LNG train is a processing facility used to liquefy and purify natural gas in the formation of LNG.\n\n## Low carbon energy / low carbon technologies\n\nLow carbon (renewable) electricity; bio-energy; electrification; future mobility solutions; carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS); blue or green hydrogen \u00ab ; and trading in low carbon products. Note that, while there is some overlap, these terms do not mean the same as bp's strategic focus area of low carbon energy or our low carbon energy sub-segment, reported within the gas & low carbon energy segment.\n\n## Low carbon investment / investment in low carbon energy / investment in low carbon\n\nCapital expenditure on low carbon energy \u00ab or technologies with investment on low carbon energy or technologies through bp ventures and Launchpad.\n\n## Low carbon and other energy transition activities\n\nLow carbon energy / technologies as described above, together with convenience; integrated gas and power; bp ventures and Launchpad.\n\n## Major projects\n\nHave a bp net investment of at least $250 million, or are considered to be of strategic importance to bp or of a high degree of complexity.\n\n## Margin share for convenience and electrification\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Margin share for convenience and electrification is the ratio of convenience and electrification gross margin to total gross margin for convenience, retail fuels and electrification. See Convenience, retail fuels and electrification gross margin definition above.\n\n## Operating cash flow\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities as stated in the group cash flow statement. When used in the context of a segment rather than the group, the terms refer to the segment's share thereof.\n\n## Operating management system (OMS)\n\nbp's OMS helps us manage risks in our operating activities by setting out bp's principles for good operating practice. It brings together bp requirements on health, safety, security, the environment, social responsibility and operational reliability, as well as related issues, such as maintenance, contractor relations and organizational learning, into a common management system.",

Organic capital expenditure comprises capital expenditure on a cash basis less inorganic capital expenditure. bp believes that this measure provides useful information as it allows investors to understand how bp's management invests funds in developing and maintaining the group's assets. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is capital expenditure on a cash basis. An analysis of organic capital expenditure by segment and region, and a reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 338.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for organic capital expenditure to total cash capital expenditure, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately the adjusting item, inorganic capital expenditure, that is difficult to predict in advance in order to derive the nearest GAAP estimate.\n\n## Production-sharing agreement / contract (PSA / PSC)\n\nAn arrangement through which an oil and gas company bears the risks and costs of exploration, development and production. In return, if exploration is successful, the oil company receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of the production remaining after such cost recovery.\n\n## Rapid/Rapid charging\n\nRapid charging includes electric vehicle charging of greater or equal to 50kW and less than 150kW.\n\n## Realizations\n\nRealizations are the result of dividing revenue generated from hydrocarbon sales, excluding revenue generated from purchases made for resale and royalty volumes, by revenue generating hydrocarbon production volumes. Revenue generating hydrocarbon production reflects the bp share of production as adjusted for any production which does not generate revenue. Adjustments may include losses due to shrinkage, amounts consumed during processing, and contractual or regulatory host committed volumes such as royalties. For the gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations segments, realizations include transfers between businesses.\n\n## Refining availability\n\nRepresents Solomon Associates' operational availability for bp-operated refineries, which is defined as the percentage of the year that a unit is available for processing after subtracting the annualized time lost due to turnaround activity and all planned mechanical, process and regulatory downtime.\n\n## Refining marker margin (RMM)\n\nThe average of regional indicator margins weighted for bp's crude refining capacity in each region. Each regional marker margin is based on product yields and a marker crude oil deemed appropriate for the region. The regional indicator margins may not be representative of the margins achieved by bp in any period because of bp's particular refinery configurations and crude and product slate.\n\n## Replacement cost (RC) profit or loss / RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders\n\nReflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is calculated as profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders, adjusting for inventory holding gains and losses (net of tax). RC profit or loss for the group is not a recognized GAAP measure. bp believes this measure is useful to illustrate to investors the fact that crude oil and product prices can vary significantly from period to period and that the impact on our reported result under IFRS can be significant. Inventory holding gains and losses vary from period to period due to changes in prices as well as changes in underlying inventory levels. In order for investors to understand the operating performance of the group excluding the impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories, and to make comparisons of operating performance between reporting periods, bp's management believes it is helpful to disclose this measure. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. See Financial statements - Note 4. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 386.\n\n## Renewables pipeline\n\nRenewable projects satisfying the criteria below until the point they can be considered developed to FID :\n\nSite based projects that have obtained land exclusivity rights, or for PPA based projects an offer has been made to the counterparty, or for auction projects pre-qualification criteria has been met, or for acquisition projects post a binding offer has been accepted.\n\n## Reserves replacement ratio\n\nThe extent to which the year's production has been replaced by proved reserves added to our reserve base. The ratio is expressed in oilequivalent terms and includes changes resulting from discoveries, improved recovery and extensions and revisions to previous estimates, but excludes changes resulting from acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Retail sites\n\nRetail sites include sites operated by dealers, jobbers, franchisees or brand licensees or joint venture (JV) partners, under the bp brand. These may move to and from the bp brand as their fuel supply agreement or brand licence agreement expires and are renegotiated in the normal course of business. Retail sites are primarily branded bp , ARCO , Amoco , Aral and Thorntons , and also includes sites in India through our Jio-bp JV.\n\n## Retail sites in growth markets\n\nThese are retail sites that are either bp branded or co-branded with our partners in China, Mexico and Indonesia and also include sites in India through our Jio-bp JV.\n\n## Return on average capital employed\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Return on average capital employed (ROACE) is defined as underlying replacement cost profit, which is defined as profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders adjusted for inventory holding gains and losses, adjusting items and related taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items total taxation, after adding back noncontrolling interest and interest expense net of tax, divided by the average of the beginning and ending balances of total equity plus finance debt, excluding cash and cash equivalents and goodwill as presented on the group balance sheet over the periods presented. Interest expense is finance costs as presented on the group income statement, excluding lease interest and the unwinding of the discount on provisions and other payables before tax. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the ROACE because this measure gives an indication of the company's capital efficiency. The nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator are profit or loss for the period attributable to bp shareholders and total equity respectively. The reconciliation of the numerator and denominator is provided on page 387.\n\nWe are unable to present forward-looking information of the nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator for ROACE, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses and interest net of tax, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n## Strategic convenience sites\n\nStrategic convenience sites are retail sites, within the bp portfolio, which sell bp-branded vehicle energy and carry one of the strategic convenience brands (e.g. M&S, Thorntons, Rewe to Go). To be considered a strategic convenience brand the convenience offer should have a demonstrable level of differentiation in the market in which it operates. Strategic convenience site count includes sites under a pilot phase, but exclude sites in growth markets.\n\n## Subsidiary\n\nAn entity that is controlled by the bp group. Control of an investee exists when an investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\n## Surplus cash flow\n\nSurplus cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and refers to the net surplus of sources of cash over uses of cash, after reaching the $35 billion net debt target. Sources of cash include net cash provided by operating activities, cash provided from investing activities and cash receipts relating to transactions involving non-controlling interests. Uses of cash include lease\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n383",

The components of our sources of cash and uses of cash are provided on page 341.\n\n## Technical service contract (TSC)\n\nTechnical service contract is an arrangement through which an oil and gas company bears the risks and costs of exploration, development and production. In return, the oil and gas company receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a profit margin which reflects incremental production added to the oilfield.\n\n## Tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events\n\nTier 1 events are losses of primary containment from a process of greatest consequence - causing harm to a member of the workforce, damage to equipment from a fire or explosion, a community impact or exceeding defined quantities. Tier 2 events are those of lesser consequence. These represent reported incidents occurring within bp's operational HSSE reporting boundary. That boundary includes bp's own operated facilities and certain other locations or situations.\n\n## Tight oil and gas\n\nNatural oil and gas reservoirs locked in hard sandstone rocks with low permeability, making the underground formation extremely tight.\n\n## Traded electricity\n\nTraded electricity refers to sales data for physically delivered electricity.\n\n## Transition and low carbon investments\n\nCapital expenditure on low carbon or other energy transition activities \u00ab .\n\n## UK National Balancing Point\n\nA virtual trading location for sale, purchase and exchange of UK natural gas. It is the pricing and delivery point for the Intercontinental Exchange natural gas futures contract.\n\n## Ultra fast/Ultra-fast charging\n\nElectric vehicle charging of greater than or equal to 150kW.\n\n## Unconventionals\n\nResources found in geographic accumulations over a large area, that usually present additional challenges to development such as low permeability or high viscosity. Examples include shale gas and oil, coalbed methane, gas hydrates and natural bitumen deposits. These typically require specialized extraction technology such as hydraulic fracturing or steam injection.\n\n## Underlying effective tax rate (ETR)\n\nNon-GAAP measure. The underlying ETR is calculated by dividing taxation on an underlying replacement cost (RC) basis by underlying RC profit or loss before tax. Taxation on an underlying RC basis for the group is calculated as taxation as stated on the group income statement adjusted for taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items total taxation. Information on underlying RC profit or loss is provided below. Taxation on an underlying RC basis presented for the operating segments is calculated through an allocation of taxation on an underlying RC basis to each segment. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the underlying ETR because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. Taxation on an underlying RC basis and underlying ETR are non-GAAP measures. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the period.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for underlying ETR to ETR on profit or loss for the period, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include the taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 386.\n\n384\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021\n\n## Underlying production\n\nProduction after adjusting for acquisitions and divestments and entitlement impacts in our production-sharing agreements (PSAs). 2021 underlying production, when compared with 2020, is production after adjusting for acquisitions and divestments, curtailments, and entitlement impacts in our production-sharing agreements/contracts and technical service contract.\n\n## Underlying replacement cost (RC) profit or loss / underlying RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders\n\nNon-GAAP measure. RC profit or loss \u00ab (as defined above) after excluding net adjusting items and related taxation. See page 339 for additional information on the adjusting items that are used to arrive at underlying RC profit or loss in order to enable a full understanding of the items and their financial impact. Underlying RC profit or loss before interest and tax for the operating segments or customers & products businesses is calculated as RC profit or loss (as defined above) including profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests before interest and tax for the operating segments and excluding net adjusting items for the respective operating segment or business.\n\nbp believes that underlying RC profit or loss is a useful measure for investors because it is a measure closely tracked by management to evaluate bp's operating performance and to make financial, strategic and operating decisions and because it may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period, by adjusting for the effects of these adjusting items. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the group is profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for segments and businesses is RC profit or loss before interest and taxation. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 386 for the group and pages 41-50 for the segments.\n\n## Underlying replacement cost (RC) profit or loss per share\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Earnings per share is defined Financial statements Note 10. Underlying RC profit or loss per ordinary share is calculated using the same denominator as earnings per share as defined in the consolidated financial statements. The numerator used is underlying RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders rather than profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. Underlying RC profit or loss per ADS is calculated as outlined above for underlying RC profit or loss per share except the denominator is adjusted to reflect one ADS equivalent to six ordinary shares. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the underlying RC profit or loss per share and per ADS because these measures may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is basic earnings per share based on profit or loss for the period attributable to bp shareholders. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 386.\n\n## upstream\n\nupstream includes oil and natural gas field development and production within the gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations segments. References to upstream exclude Rosneft.\n\n## upstream / hydrocarbon plant reliability\n\nbp-operated upstream plant reliability is calculated taking 100% less the ratio of total unplanned plant deferrals divided by installed production capacity, excluding non-operated assets and bpx energy. Unplanned plant deferrals are associated with the topside plant and where applicable the subsea equipment (excluding wells and reservoir). Unplanned plant deferrals include breakdowns, which does not include Gulf of Mexico weather related downtime.\n\n## upstream unit production costs\n\nupstream unit production costs are calculated as production costs divided by units of production. Production costs do not include ad valorem and severance taxes. Units of production are barrels for liquids and thousands of cubic feet for gas. Amounts disclosed are for bp subsidiaries only and do not include bp's share of equity-accounted entities.\n\n## West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\n\nA light sweet crude oil, priced at Cushing, Oklahoma, which serves as a benchmark price for purchases of oil in the US.",
