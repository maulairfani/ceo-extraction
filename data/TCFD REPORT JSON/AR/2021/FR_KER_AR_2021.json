It is 41.7%-owned by the Art\u00e9mis holding company, which is  controlled  by  the  Group's  founding Pinault family. Alongside this solid core shareholder, the Group's ownership structure has become increasingly international over a period of more than 10 years, reflecting the Group's worldwide growth and transformation. Institutional investors  own 53.5% of its shares, with 7.4%  held  by  French  institutions  and 46.1%  by  investors  residing  outside France.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n% of the capital held as of December 31, 2021 (source: shareholders' identification).\n\n## 3.2 A Board of Directors with a long-term vision for the Group\n\nOur governance structure is aligned with best practice. As well as ensuring that strategic decisions are taken and implemented effectively, it ensures a genuine balance of powers.\n\n## Unified governance, well suited to Kering's specific features\n\nKering  has  opted  to  combine  the  roles  of  Chairman  of  the Board  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  taking  the  view  that  this governance arrangement is the one that best suits the Group's specific  features,  in  which  each  of  the  Group's  Houses  have creative autonomy. It reflects Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault's specific position as controlling shareholder and his close involvement in conducting the Group's business, of which he has in-depth operational knowledge. This governance arrangement guarantees an  effective  strategic  decision-making  process,  allows  the Group's economic and financial performance to be optimized, and ensures strong, consistent communication. The Chairman and CEO is supported by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus, Group Managing Director,  who  helps  develop  Kering's  strategy,  manages  its implementation  and  focuses  on  enhancing  the  Group's operational efficiency.\n\n## The Lead Independent Director: ensuring the balance of powers within the governance structure and the smooth running of the Board\n\nWith  a  view  to  achieving  and  maintaining  an  appropriate balance of power on its Board, the Group strives to ensure that its membership is suitably balanced and diverse. Members of the Board have backgrounds in a variety of industries and are mainly independent.\n\nIn addition, given that the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are combined and to provide additional assurance  with  regard  to  the  Board's  smooth  running  and balance of power, the Board of Directors decided in 2019, on the  recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee, to create the role of Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director is consulted on the agenda and schedule of Board meetings and may propose additional agenda items to the Chairman. He/she liaises between the independent Directors,  other  Board  members  and  Executive  Management and prevents the occurrence of conflicts of interest concerning corporate officers. He/she monitors compliance with the Board's internal rules and takes part in the process of assessing the Board of  Directors.  The  Lead  Independent  Director,  in  coordination with the Chairman of the Board, also represents the Board in its dealings  with  investors  concerning  ESG  matters.  He/she  stays informed about shareholders' requests in relation to corporate governance  and  ensures  that  responses  are  provided.  The duties  of  the  Lead  Independent  Director  are  provided  for  and described in the internal rules of the Board of Directors.",

Against  a  backdrop  of  everfaster  change,  new  economies  are  taking  shape  as  cultures evolve, disruptive technologies emerge and young, \"always-on' consumers  seek  meaningful  connections  and  a  more sustainable approach. These changes are shaking up the rules.\n\nKering is setting the trend, purposefully shaping the Luxury of tomorrow, which will be more responsible and more in tune with our times and with the future, while remaining true to the exceptional history and heritage of its Houses.\n\nOur  ambition  is  to  be  the  world's  most  influential  Luxury group  in  terms  of  creativity,  sustainability  and  economic performance.\n\nConsumers have new expectations. Tradition and expertise are no  longer  enough.  Consumers  today  want  to  express  their unique  individuality  and  our  vision  of  Luxury  supports  this radical  shift.  We  dare  to  take  risks,  think  differently,  and constantly  propose  fresh  and  innovative  ideas  that  inspire emotion and enthusiasm for our exceptional products, as well as allowing all clients to express their distinctive personality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our business model\n\nA multi-brand model built on a long-term approach and creative autonomy for our Houses\n\nKering is a global Luxury group, managing the development of a  series  of  renowned  Houses  in  fashion,  leather  goods  and jewelry:  Gucci,  Saint  Laurent,  Bottega  Veneta,  Alexander McQueen,  Balenciaga,  Brioni,  Boucheron,  Pomellato,  DoDo, Qeelin, and Kering Eyewear.\n\nThanks to our international footprint and the strength of our Houses combined with the creative autonomy they enjoy and the  unique  quality  of  our  creations,  Kering  is  among  the foremost  players  in  the  luxury  goods  market.  Our  model fosters rapid growth for our brands and creates the space for them to thrive.\n\n## 'Our multi-brand approach is built on a long-term vision and combines agility, balance and responsibility'\n\n## AGILITY\n\nKering provides its Houses with an organizational structure that unlocks their potential for excellence\n\n## \u00b7 Constancy\n\nKering began as a family company more than 50 years ago and is now controlled by Artemis, a holding company owned by the Pinault family. With this strong and stable shareholder, Kering boasts  an  attractive  and  sustainable  profile  conducive  to developing its vision in the luxury goods market over the long term.\n\n## \u00b7 Transformation\n\nFrom  a  conglomerate  of  diversified  retail  activities  until  the early 2000s, Kering has transformed itself into a Luxury group focusing on personal goods. We are now an integrated group bringing  together  and  developing  some  of  the  world's  most prestigious Houses. Through the years, we have been able to leverage the most effective growth drivers.\n\n## \u00b7 Clarity\n\nKering helps its Houses realize their full growth potential. At each stage of their development, they benefit from innovative logistics platforms, digital services and technological infrastructure, and common support functions. By encouraging imagination  in  all  its  forms,  our  organization  fosters  strict management while enabling our Houses to unleash the best of  their  talent  and  creativity.  The  Group  ensures  that  the brands'  success  is  aligned  with  their  long-term  visions  and objectives. Thanks to our curiosity, capacity for self-reflection and big-picture thinking, we can achieve the clarity necessary to set a successful course for the Group and its Houses.\n\nWhat  Kering  and  its  Houses  propose  is  an  experience.  Our values are closely related to the powerful creative content of our  products,  which  imbues  them  with  modernity.  Those values  are  complemented  by  the  entrepreneurial  spirit  that permeates each of our brands and by the vision of our creative teams. Kering is made up of women and men who strive each day to create authentic, ever-changing, engaged and inclusive Luxury.\n\nWe  want  to  play  our  part  in  the  emergence  of  a  more environmentally friendly world. We are constantly raising our creative  and  production  standards  to  ensure  respect  for  the planet while at the same time having positive social impacts. We aim to create value that is equitably distributed among all our stakeholders.\n\nKering  is  pronounced  \"caring',  which  is  much  more  than  a simple allusion - it gives meaning to everything we do.",

Following  our  successful  transformation  into  a leading luxury goods player, we boast some of the industry's most prestigious Houses. Our brands complement each other well  with  their  distinctive  market  positions,  and  each  play  a role in a coherent ensemble.\n\n## \u00b7 A multi-brand model\n\nWe  use  our  strength  as  a  Group  to  help  forge  a  distinctive identity for each House. Our brands find ways to express their unique  characters.  The  Group  supports  the  brands  by providing  expertise,  exercising  its  power  as  a  group  to  exert influence,  improving  supply  chain  reliability  and  opening  up access  to  distribution  networks,  as  well  as  enhancing  the client  experience,  especially  in  digital  channels.  It  also encourages the Houses to share best practice with a view to driving innovation.\n\n## \u00b7 An ensemble of complementary Houses\n\nWhile  our  most  firmly  established  Houses  are  reinventing themselves and re-engaging with their audiences, our emerging brands are focused on realizing their full potential and gaining new  clients.  With  both  well-established  and  still-emerging brands  in  various  specialties,  segments  and  markets,  Kering has  an  extensive  footprint  in  diverse  regions.  Due  to  the variety of its clients, products, brands and locations, the Group is  well  placed  to  weather  changes  in  market  conditions  and seize  growth  opportunities.  Kering's  global  reach  proved crucial  during  the  pandemic  and  the  subsequent  recovery from  it,  alleviating  the  impacts  of  store  closures  in  certain regions  and  taking  advantage  of  the  rapid  rebound  in  local demand in the Americas, China and Europe.\n\n## 'Our economic model is built on exceptional Houses, complementary market positions and varying maturity profiles'\n\n## RESPONSIBILITY\n\nAll our operations are founded on a responsible economic model. Our comprehensive, sustainable approach is a structural competitive advantage\n\n## \u00b7 Toward sustainable Luxury\n\nCan a responsible economic approach change the very nature of Luxury? For Kering, the answer is a resounding \"yes'. For our Houses,  sustainability  is  in  line  with  our  vision  of  modern Luxury.  Businesses  have  an  ethical  obligation  to  be  more responsible, reflecting society's new expectations. This situation can also be viewed as an opportunity to grow, and is a source of  inspiration  and  innovation.  Methods,  materials,  resources and  products  are  being  reinvented,  and  client  usage  and expectations  are  changing.  Kering  is  changing  the  way  it designs  luxury  products  by  incorporating  the  criterion  of sustainable  value,  for  our  clients  as  well  as  for  society.  The targets identified to improve the Group's social and environmental performance are set out in our 2025 sustainability strategy.\n\n## \u00b7 An inclusive approach\n\nThe  aim  of  the  responsible  model  is  to  rethink  Kering's relationships  with  its  stakeholders  so  as  to  ensure  fairness and  responsibility. Affecting all dimensions  of  Kering's eco-system,  from  the  Group's  strategy  and  the  Houses' creative  decisions  to  operational  production,  processing  and distribution choices, the model aims to reduce the social and environmental  impacts  of  the  Group's  operations.  Placing people  at  the  heart  of  the  model  brings  an  entrepreneurial spirit, engaging employees and stakeholders.\n\n## \u00b7 Creative potential\n\nResponsibility is deeply embedded in the Group's organizational structure  and  promotes  business  growth  through  ever  more innovative  and  attractive  products.  It  rewards  best  business practices such as good cost control and process upgrading. In a  context  of  limited  natural  resources,  new  high-quality materials are being fashioned and more sustainable processes devised. We are constantly on the look-out for innovative and disruptive technologies. For our brands, this represents a vast swathe of creative territory yet to be explored.\n\n## \u00b7 Governance and ethics\n\nBuilt  on  the  Group's  core  values,  Kering's  responsible  model leverages  an  ambitious  governance  structure,  supported  by the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  Sustainability  Committee. Together  they  drive  the  sustainability  strategy,  which  the Houses  put  into  action  every  day  under  the  guidance  of dedicated experts. The Group's Ethics Committees, Compliance structure  and  whistleblowing  procedure  for  employees  and third parties ensure that Kering's Code of Ethics and principles for responsible business conduct are properly applied.\n\n'Being a responsible Luxury group means crafting the Luxury of tomorrow - we perceive change as an opportunity and a source of growth'\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the coming years, the Group will continue to strengthen and sustain its growth momentum.\n\n## Promoting organic growth\n\n## \u00b7 Above-market performance in an industry set to deliver growth in the medium and long term\n\nThe future of the luxury goods market is fundamentally bright. The growth of emerging economies, the cultural exposure of new populations  to  global  brands  and  the  increasing  use  of new  technologies  are  major  sources  of  value  creation  for Kering. The challenge for each of our Houses is to outperform its respective market.\n\n## \u00b7 Product innovation\n\nEnergized  by  their  creative  teams,  our  Houses  are  setting trends.  Backed  by  the  Group,  they  are  constantly  coming  up with fresh ideas. Their offerings both stimulate and meet their clients'  expectations  and  aspirations  by  arousing  desire, inspiring dreams and tapping into emotions.\n\n## \u00b7 Sales efficiency\n\nIn  their  networks  of  directly  operated  stores,  our  brands deploy initiatives to boost sales performance, capitalizing on increasingly effective merchandising and in-store operational excellence, supported by the Group and its dedicated teams. Optimizing  same-store  sales  performance  is  a  key  organic growth driver for Kering.\n\n## \u00b7 Client experience\n\nImproving  the  in-store  client  experience  is  central  to  driving sales performance. Support for clients before, during and after the sale - in stores or online - is what enables our Houses to create  and  sustain  lasting  connections.  A  personalized  client experience and customization help make  each  client relationship unique. The decisions to bring client relations and e-commerce  platforms  back  in-house,  to  speed  up  the development  of  distance  selling  tools  and  to  increase  the proportion of sales coming from retail stores we control were guided by the same aim.\n\n## \u00b7 Omni-channel approach\n\nOur  clients  are  connected  and  mobile,  constantly  moving between  distribution  channels,  from  digital  platforms  to brick-and-mortar  stores.  Our  client  relations  strategy  is epitomized  by  continuity  across  all  communication  and distribution channels. This holistic omni-channel approach is supported by the selective extension of the directly operated store network, distribution agreements, travel retail, e-commerce, social media and digital communication. In 2021, we continued efforts that had begun in 2020 to migrate some of our Houses onto  the  e-commerce  platform  developed  and  managed internally. This migration has been a key phase of our strategy, especially  in  view  of  the  rapid  increase  in  online  sales penetration. It gives us control over the whole value chain so as to provide clients with a truly exceptional experience across all  channels  and  touchpoints,  aligning  the  e-commerce  side with the standards of excellence seen in its boutiques thanks to a range of omni-channel services.\n\n## \u00b7 Digital expertise, CRM and innovation\n\nA number of projects have been set up to support Kering in its digital transformation and drive forward its e-commerce, CRM, data  science  and  innovation  activities.  Our  Digital  and  Client Relations  team  is  developing  One-to-Many,  One-to-Few  and One-to-One  tools  that  are  considerably  improving  the  client experience  and  customer  service.  It  uses  available  data  to analyze and improve the performance of our Houses, and in particular  uses  artificial  intelligence  for  planning  purposes. The Group's Innovation team is continuing to fulfill its remit: firstly,  to  instill  an  internal  culture  of  innovation  (applying  a test-and-learn approach, sharing discoveries quickly, scouting business  trends,  etc.)  and  secondly,  to  work  on  disruptive technologies to enrich our business models and support our sustainability efforts.\n\n'Digital is simultaneously accelerating and deepening our relationships with our clients, allowing us to offer them an exceptional shopping experience'",

Our brands benefit  from  Group-wide  synergies  while  preserving  their unique characters and exclusivity.\n\n## \u00b7 Resource pooling\n\nOur Houses share certain support functions, allowing them to concentrate  on  what  really  counts:  creativity,  production quality,  product  range  development  and  renewal,  client relations,  as  well  as  brand  and  product  communication.  The Group  pools  resources  and  streamlines  certain  strategic functions  such  as  logistics,  indirect  purchasing,  legal  affairs, property, accounting, media relations, IT and the development of  new  tools  (in  particular  with  respect  to  the  omni-channel approach). Relieved of this burden, our Houses can focus their energy on creativity.\n\n## \u00b7 Cross-business expertise\n\nIn  order  to  enrich  its  brands'  offerings,  the  Group  draws  on cross-business  expertise.  A  notable  success  story  in  this domain  is  Kering  Eyewear,  which  has  been  developed internally since 2014 and in July 2021 was strengthened with the acquisition of Danish luxury eyewear brand LINDBERG. Our Houses benefit from having a dedicated specialist entity that ensures  full  control  over  the  value  chain  of  their  frame  and sunglasses  businesses,  comprising  creation,  development, supply chain, brand strategy, marketing and distribution. This innovative management model enables Kering to harness the full  growth  potential  of  its  brands  in  this  category  and generate significant value creation opportunities.\n\n## \u00b7 Growth platforms and operating efficiency\n\nKering  is  constantly  improving  and  adapting  its  operating model to ensure its structures are ever more up-to-date and flexible. The Group has launched an ambitious transformation project focusing on its information systems, supply chain and\n\nlogistics.  The  aim  is  to  adapt  these  functions  to  the  Group's new scope, as well as to changing consumer trends and client expectations.  With  shared,  state-of-the-art  IT,  as  well  as redefined logistics operations that include the construction of new warehouses in the United States (2019), Italy (2020-2021) and  ultimately  Asia,  the  Group's  brands  will  be  in  a  better position  to  anticipate  demand,  respond  more  quickly  and adapt inventory management in order to optimize costs.\n\n## \u00b7 Talent excellence\n\nWe pay particular attention to the professional development and fulfillment of the women and men working for our Houses and in our headquarters. Based on ever-greater mobility, our ambitious worldwide human resources strategy facilitates the growth  of  the  Houses  through  a  shared  pool  of  talented individuals, expertise and excellence. The Group helps employees reach their potential and express their creativity by developing skills  and  performance,  as  well  as  by  offering  aspirational development opportunities.\n\nOur policy of promoting diversity, gender parity and inclusiveness is  a  source  of  collective  intelligence  and  enrichment  but also  fundamental  to  our  culture  of  equality,  allowing  each individual to realize their full potential. It also lies at the heart of  talent  management  actions  and  initiatives  taken  by  the Group and its Houses.\n\nKering also pays careful attention to the role of women, who make  up  the  majority  of  its  employees  and  clients.  Internal systems  are  in  place  to  guarantee  gender  equality,  as evidenced by our ambitious global parental policy. The Kering Foundation  is  committed  to  combating  violence  against women.  The  aim  of  the  Women  in  Motion  initiative  is  to showcase  the  contribution  of  women  to  the  film  industry, whether in front of the camera or behind.\n\n'The Group strives to create value for its Houses and is geared to unlocking their creative potential'\n\n<!-- image -->",

Size and trends\n\n## A. Size\n\nThe worldwide personal luxury goods market enjoyed solid growth of 5% per year from 2014 to 2019, while major listed groups typically  outperformed,  with  growth  of  around  11%.  %.  In  2020,  the  industry  was  severely  affected  by  the  public  health  crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The sector rebounded strongly in 2021, with sales rising above their pre-crisis level. Sector sales in 2021 totaled \u20ac283 billion, up 1% as reported and up 4% on a comparable basis compared to 2019 according to Bain & Altagamma.\n\n## Global luxury goods market (in \u20ac billions)\n\n| reported   | +3%   | +12%   | 0%   | +4%   | +3%   | +7%   | -23%   | +30%   |\n|------------|-------|--------|------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|\n| comparable | +3%   | +1%    | 0%   | +5%   | +7%   | +4%   | -22%   | +31%   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource:  Bain-Altagamma  Luxury  Goods  Worldwide  Market  Study  published  in  November  2021,  supplemented  by  a  detailed  report  published  in December 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

According  to  IATA,  global  air  traffic,  in  terms  of passenger numbers, was more than 50% lower in 2021 than in 2019.\n- \u00b7 There was a rise domestic and intra-regional tourism.\n\n## II. Competitive environment\n\nAlthough  fragmented,  the  worldwide  personal  luxury  goods market is nonetheless characterized by the presence of a few large global players, often part of multi-brand groups, as well as  a  large  number  of  smaller  independent  players.  These players  compete  in  different  segments  in  terms  of  both product  category  and  geographic  location.  Kering  operates alongside the most prominent global groups in the personal luxury goods market: LVMH, Herm\u00e8s, Richemont, Chanel, Prada and Burberry.\n\n- \u00b7 Spending was relocated, confirming the trend seen in 2020: in  2021,  95%  of  luxury  goods  purchases  were  by  local clients, i.e. in their domestic markets.\n- \u00b7 Prices rose and the product mix improved.\n- \u00b7 Online  shopping  remained  appealing,  and  its  contribution to  total  personal  luxury  goods  remained constant in 2021 after doubling in 2020.\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  the  sector's  profitability  recovered  to  2019  levels due  to  the  rebound  in  demand  and  despite  greater marketing and digital expenditure.\n- \u00b7 Geopolitical and socio-economic tensions were persistent.\n- \u00b7 Exchanges rates remained unfavorable until late in the year.\n\nA phenomenon known as performance polarization has been observed over the past four to five years, and it became more pronounced in 2021. This phenomenon involves:\n\n- \u00b7 above-market  performances  by  certain  players,  usually  of significant size or belonging to a multi-brand group; and\n- \u00b7 in  contrast,  below-market  performances  by  mono-brand and/or medium-sized players.\n\n## III.

In  2021,  business  in  the  region  grew sharply,  rising  41%  as  reported  compared  to  2020,  taking  it above its 2019 level (up 13% at comparable exchange rates). The United States saw a sharp rebound, with European luxury brands achieving higher market shares. Secondary cities such as  Atlanta,  Detroit,  Houston  and  Dallas  and  suburban  areas continued to perform well, while large cities and regions (New York, Boston and Miami) regained impetus.\n\nIn  2021,  sales  in  Europe  rose  by  20%  as  reported  relative to 2020, but remained lower than their pre-crisis level (down 19% compared  to  2019  at  comparable  exchange  rates).  Local consumption was firm across the region, and tourists returned to  Europe  from  certain  countries  in  the  Americas  and  the Middle  East  during  the  summer,  although  those  from  Asia generally  stayed  away,  which  continued  to  harm  sales  in\n\nEurope. In some European countries, where a larger proportion of  sales  come  from  local  clients,  sales  were  more  resilient (Germany) or even rose above pre-crisis levels (Russia).\n\nMomentum remained good in Mainland China, with sales up 36% as reported relative to 2020. This market's proportion of global sales  was  almost  double  that  seen  in  2019.  China  now accounts for 21% of the global luxury market, up 10 percentage points relative to 2019. Chinese clients repatriated spending to their  local  market  and,  together  with  the  market's  underlying dynamics, this allowed prices to rise. Local lockdowns affected sales in the third quarter, although this did not adversely affect China's  performance  as  a  whole.  Hong  Kong  continued  its downward trend as its position as a leading tourist destination for  luxury  goods  purchases  suffered.  Chinese  tourists  shifted their spending back to Mainland China, particularly to Hainan province. Because of lower tourist numbers, Chinese consumers were less of a growth driver than the domestic Chinese market.",

Local consumer spending was  held  back  by  a  lower  COVID-19  vaccination  rate  than  in other major markets in the first nine months of 2021, and by a cautious approach to pandemic risks.\n\nAmong other Asian markets, South Korea saw sales rise back to  2019  levels,  with  repatriated  spending  by  local  clients offsetting the lack of tourists.\n\n## IV. Product categories\n\nAll categories  of  Luxury  saw  rapid  year-on-year  growth in 2021, with sales up 29% on average and growth of over 20% in each category. However, 2020 had been a particularly difficult year  for  some  of  them,  and  so  the  base  for  comparison differed.  Relative  to  2019,  Shoes,  Leather  Goods  and  Jewelry fared  the  best,  while  performance  was  weaker  in  Apparel\n\nThe rest of the world - including the Middle East, Africa and Australia  -  represented  4%  of  the  worldwide  personal  luxury goods market in 2021 and saw significant growth, with sales up  34%  as  reported.  Growth  in  these  countries  was  driven mainly  by  the  Middle  East,  led  by  Dubai  and  Saudi  Arabia. Australia  substantially  underperformed  because  of  its  extended lockdowns.\n\n(sharp  correction  in  formalwear),  Perfumes  and  Cosmetics (exposure to duty-free sales) and Watches (wholesale inventories and lower sell-out).\n\nThe  worldwide  personal  luxury  goods  market  is  divided  into seven main product categories, as shown below.\n\n## Worldwide personal luxury goods market: breakdown by category (2021e)\n\n|                                            |   Size (in \u20ac billions) | Reported change  vs. 2019   | Reported change  vs. 2020   | Proportion of total market   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Apparel                                    |                     57 | -10%                        | +26%                        | 20%                          |\n| Leather Goods                              |                     62 | +8%                         | +32%                        | 22%                          |\n| Shoes                                      |                     23 | +11%                        | +25%                        | 8%                           |\n| Watches                                    |                     40 | +0%                         | +32%                        | 14%                          |\n| Jewelry                                    |                     22 | +7%                         | +24%                        | 8%                           |\n| Perfumes and cosmetics                     |                     60 | -1%                         | +26%                        | 21%                          |\n| Other (eyewear, textile accessories, etc.) |                     19 | N/A                         | +46%                        | 7%                           |\n| TOTAL                                      |                    283 | +1%                         | +29%                        | 100%                         |\n\nSource:  Bain-Altagamma  Luxury  Goods  Worldwide  Market  Study  published  in  November  2021,  supplemented  by  a  detailed  report  published  in December 2021.\n\n## Apparel\n\nThe  apparel  category  represented  20%  of  the  total  personal luxury goods market in 2021 and was worth an estimated \u20ac57 billion.

This category includes handbags, small leather goods (wallets, purses, etc.), and other leather products. Leather goods sales returned to growth and were  8%  higher  than  in  2019,  due  to  the  appeal  of  iconic products  and  new  launches,  particularly  among  the  younger generations.\n\nKering  operates  in  this  category  primarily  through  the  Gucci, Saint  Laurent  and  Bottega  Veneta  brands  and,  to  a  lesser extent, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was the industry's most dynamic  category,  with  sales  up  11%  as  reported  relative to 2019, driven by the trend towards less formal shoes such as sneakers, especially among men, and strong sales of occasion shoes among women.\n\nKering mainly operates in this product category through Gucci, Saint  Laurent,  Bottega  Veneta,  Alexander  McQueen  and Balenciaga.\n\n## Watches\n\nThis  category  generated  revenue  of  \u20ac40  billion  in  2021, representing  14%  of  the  total  personal  luxury  goods  market. Sales recovered to 2019 levels as reported. Kering operates in this category  across  different  price  points  with  Gucci Timepieces,  Boucheron  and,  until  recently,  Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin.\n\n## Jewelry\n\nJewelry sales rose 7% as reported in 2021 relative to 2019 to reach  \u20ac22  billion,  representing  8%  of  the  personal  luxury goods market. The category saw a firm upturn, partly driven by a rebound in High Jewelry, as clients valued its creativity and investment value. Unisex jewelry also proved very popular.\n\nKering operates in this category primarily through Boucheron, Pomellato,  DoDo  and  Qeelin,  but  also  Gucci,  whose  offering ranges from fashion jewelry to a high jewelry collection.\n\n## V. Distribution channels\n\n## Worldwide personal luxury goods market: breakdown by distribution channel (2019-2021e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Wholesale\n\nSource: Bain-Altagamma Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study published in  November  2021,  supplemented  by  a  detailed  report  published  in December 2021.\n\n- 38\n\n## Perfumes and cosmetics\n\nThis  category  represented  21%  of  the  total  personal  luxury goods market in 2021 and was worth an estimated \u20ac60 billion, down 1% relative to 2019.\n\nKering  operates  in  this  product  category  through  licensing agreements  between  its  main  brands  and  leading  industry players such as L'Or\u00e9al, Coty and Interparfums to develop and sell perfumes and cosmetics.\n\n## Other (eyewear, textile accessories, etc.)\n\nPersonal  luxury  goods  that  do  not  fit  into  the  categories mentioned  above  represented  7%  of  the  market  in  2021,  or \u20ac19 billion in revenue.\n\nThe  global  eyewear  market  is  estimated  to  be  worth  over \u20ac100 billion (at retail prices) according to Mordor Intelligence and Euromonitor data. It comprises several product segments: spectacles,  contact  lenses,  sunglasses  and  other  products. The  high-end  (frames  and  sunglasses)  sub-segment  is estimated to be worth \u20ac7 billion at retail prices, based on unit prices  starting  from  \u20ac190.  Kering  Eyewear  is  positioned  as  a leading player in the strategic luxury eyewear segment, with a comprehensive,  balanced  portfolio  of  16  brands  including luxury  and  lifestyle  brands:  Gucci,  Cartier,  Saint  Laurent, Bottega  Veneta,  Balenciaga,  Chlo\u00e9,  Alexander  McQueen, Montblanc,  Brioni,  Dunhill,  Boucheron,  Pomellato,  Ala\u00efa,  McQ and PUMA. Kering added to its eyewear brand portfolio in 2021 by acquiring Denmark's LINDBERG.\n\n## Retail channel\n\nIn  2021,  the  retail  channel  accounted  for  49%  of  in-person sales  in  the  worldwide  personal  luxury  goods  market,  as opposed  to  40%  in  2019.  A  strong  directly  operated  store network  is  important  for  the  success  of  a  luxury  brand  as  it allows greater control over the consumer shopping experience and over the product mix, merchandising and customer service.\n\nIn the case of Kering's Houses, the share of retail sales is far higher  (81%),  reflecting  the  maturity  of  some  of  the  brands, Kering's  strategic  commitment  to  grow  its  directly  operated network  and  growth  in  the  portion  of  online  sales  made  via the brands' own websites.\n\nIt  also reflects the importance of leather goods and accessories, which  represent  a  higher  share  of  the  product  mix  for  retail sales, in the Group's luxury ranges.",

        "page_content": "## Wholesale channel\n\nThe  wholesale  channel  typically  includes  department  stores, independent  high-end  multi-brand  stores  and  franchise stores,  and  accounted  for  approximately  51%  of  the  total worldwide personal luxury goods market in 2021. This channel can  thus  be  multi-brand  or  mono-brand.  The  share  of wholesale  sales  is  typically  higher  in  ready-to-wear  and watches, and is also more significant than retail in the channel mix for brands that stand at an earlier stage of maturity. For the Kering group, the wholesale channel (which also includes other  revenues)  accounts  for  19%  of  the  Luxury  Houses' revenue. That proportion has fallen considerably, in line with the  Group's  increasing  efforts  to  control  its  own  distribution and focus on key partners.\n\n## VI. Market outlook\n\nKey trends for 2022 include:\n\n- \u00b7 further  growth  in  the  global  economy,  continuing  the post-2020 recovery, with Oxford Economics estimating that global GDP should grow by 3.4% (1) in 2022, having exceeded its 2019 level by the end of 2021;\n- \u00b7 an  upturn  in  global  air  traffic  based  on  the  number  of passengers, depending on how well vaccination campaigns progress and on how governments ease cross-border travel restrictions. IATA estimates  that  total  air passenger numbers could recover to 75% of their 2019 level, although with wide variations between domestic traffic (93% of their 2019 level) and international traffic (44%);\n- \u00b7 a continuation of the repatriation of consumption back to local markets, particularly in China, and the ensuing impact on spending by Chinese tourists, depending on the pace at which international tourism recovers;\n- \u00b7 a further increase in the penetration of e-commerce in the personal  luxury  goods  market  and  constantly  growing demand  from  consumers  for  increasingly  sophisticated digital experiences;\n- \u00b7 mixed performances across regions, with Europe remaining partly  dependent  on  the  recovery  in  tourist  numbers,  the United States potentially maintaining its good performance in  2021  and  establishing  itself  as  a  new  growth  driver  for the industry, and  Asia  (particularly Mainland  China) continuing to drive the industry's expansion;\n- \u00b7 possible pressure on supply chains and distribution arising from  difficulties  in  logistics  caused  by  the  ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGlobal  demand  for  luxury  goods  should  grow  by  6-10% year-on-year in 2022 according to Bain-Altagamma.\n\nIn  the  longer  term ,  the  personal  luxury  goods  market  is expected  to  grow  at  an  annual  rate  of  6-8%  between  2021 and 2025, and could be worth \u20ac360-380 billion by the end of that  period.  Our  brands  are  ideally  positioned  to  win  market share in this buoyant industry.\n\n## E-commerce\n\nAfter  seeing  the  equivalent  of  five  years  of  growth  in  2020, online sales of luxury goods continued to grow at a rapid pace in 2021, rising by 27% year-on-year. This includes sales made through  brand  websites  (retail  channel)  and  via  department store websites and e-tailers (wholesale).\n\nKering's Houses operate their own e-commerce sites. This has long been the case for Gucci, and since 2020 or 2021 for the Group's  other  brands.  In  2021,  the  Group's  brands  also  took greater  control  in  terms  of  multibrand  distribution,  moving away  from  wholesale  models  and  towards  e-concession models. Online sales accounted for around 15% of the Luxury Houses'  retail  sales  on  average,  a  higher  proportion  than  in either  2019 or 2020.\n\nThe market's underlying growth drivers are:\n\n- \u00b7 new consumer segments, driven by a booming upper-middle class (urbanization, higher standards of living and a tendency to devote a larger budget share to discretionary spending);\n- \u00b7 generations  Y  and  Z:  these  generations  are  expected  to account  for  more  than  70%  of  the  market  in  2025  as opposed to 57% in 2020 as they become older and as their appetite for the sector increases;\n- \u00b7 countries  or  regions  that  are  expected  to  make  a  greater contribution  to  the  growth  of  the  personal  luxury  goods market: Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Thailand, etc.), Brazil, Australia, Africa and India;\n- \u00b7 an increase in high-spending consumer classes such as ultra high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), who have accumulated a great deal of wealth;\n- \u00b7 the  development  of  distribution  channels,  particularly e-commerce, which is expected to account for more than 30% of total personal luxury goods sales by 2025;\n- \u00b7 the development of new high-end products and services;\n- \u00b7 the  use  of  new  digital  client  engagement  models  that increase retention and the average value of each client;\n- \u00b7 increasing  interest  in  second-hand  luxury  goods.  The second-hand  market  generated  an  estimated  \u20ac33  billion in  2021,  with  growth  driven  by  increased  environmental awareness  among  consumers.  Certain  clients,  particularly among the younger generations, also see the second-hand segment as a more accessible way to enter the luxury goods market;\n- \u00b7 new technology-related markets (metaverse, NFTs etc.).\n\nThese trends are expected to drive an increase in the number of luxury market clients from around 380-390 million in 2019 to around 450 million in 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over the last six years, Gucci has gained a leadership position within  the  industry  thanks  to  its  contemporary  approach  to luxury  fashion  driven  by  groundbreaking  creativity  and  a distinctive company culture.\n\nGucci  collections  and  products  represent  the  pinnacle  of Italian  craftsmanship  and  savoir-faire.  They  are  sold  through 501  directly  operated  boutiques,  a  directly  operated  online store  (active  in  35  markets),  a  limited  number  of  franchises, and selected department and specialty stores.\n\nOver the last six years, Gucci has received numerous accolades for  its  business  transformation  and  success  founded  upon  its unique corporate culture that prioritizes creativity, authenticity, inclusivity, diversity, self-expression and sustainability. Building on these foundational values and leveraging its ability to renew and  reinvent  while  remaining  true  to  its  DNA,  the  House  has embraced  the  new  world  order  brought  on  by  the  COVID-19\n\n## Key highlights 2021\n\nAlthough still  partially  impacted  by  disruption  caused  by  the COVID-19 restrictions, Gucci showed strength in 2021 notably thanks to a much-enhanced focus on local clients.\n\nFor its 100th anniversary, Gucci planned a year-long program of diverse activities, starting in Florence with the unveiling of Gucci Garden  Archetypes,  an  immersive  multimedia  experience  that explores the House's creative vision, and the opening of the new Gucci Archive in the historic Palazzo Settimanni, celebrating the House's rich legacy and craftsmanship, then continuing with a series of events and launches that reinforced the brand's DNA.\n\nFrom  a  product  perspective,  the  House  consolidated  its permanent  products  spotlighting  its  Beloved  handbag  lines throughout  the  year  with  a  full  program  of  activations including the launch of the Gucci Diana , a refreshed version of a historical Gucci bag, which has been extremely well received in  all  markets  and  across  generations.  In  addition  to  the strategic  focus  on  the  most  renowned  lines,  exploiting  the newly  established  'always  on'  rhythm,  the  House  sustained engagement and built excitement through the introduction of new items and capsules, perfectly complementing the offer.\n\nAs  part  of  the  brand  strategy,  Gucci  continued  to  expand  its high-end  offer,  with  the  launch  of  high  watches  and  the extension  of  high  jewelry,  also  deploying  successful  special events  and  brand  experiences,  such  as  Gucci  Spaces,  Gucci Circolo  and  other  dedicated  presentations  of  the  complete high-end offer including the Leather Goods category.\n\nGucci  accelerated  its  fine  fragrances  business,  managed  in partnership with Coty Prestige, through the successful launch of Gucci  Flora  Gorgeous  and  the  enrichment  of  The  Alchemist's Garden luxury collection. In parallel, the distribution network for Gucci's  highly  successful  make-up  line  was  further  expanded thanks to an intense physical and digital roll-out.\n\nGucci  pursued  its  innovative  approach.  In  2021,  the  House launched Gucci Lifestyle, a new category including leisure items, games  and  stationery.  With  a  view  to  exploring  emerging business models, Gucci has established a dedicated unit that has\n\npandemic  with  bold  decisions,  marking  the  beginning  of  the next chapter in its business and brand evolution.\n\nOn  one  side,  actions  have  been  taken  to  further  control  and limit distribution as part of the ongoing strategy to increase the brand's  equity.  While  on  the  other  side,  the  Gucci  Aria  Fall Winter  2021  collection  presented  in  April  represented  a significant  aesthetic  turning  point,  with  its  more  refined  and sophisticated  sensibility  reinforcing  the  codes  of  the  brand through a constant blend between past, present and future. The new  aesthetic  has  then  been  further  consolidated  with  the Gucci Love Parade Spring Summer 2022 collection presented in an  extraordinary  fashion  show  on  Hollywood's  iconic  Walk  of Fame in November. Gucci also decided to adapt the timing and the cadence of its main collections transitioning to an \"always on\" calendar of product drops, capsules and collaborations providing for a continuous product narrative throughout the year.\n\nIn  conclusion,  the  evolution  of  the  business  model  started  last year  with  a  much  stronger  control  of  the  distribution  together with the elevation of the aesthetic brought by Aria first and Love Parade  afterwards  allowed  the  company  to  achieve  in  the  last months of the year an improved trend, as a consequence of the actions taken reinforcing the brand for the long term.\n\nbeen  implementing  an  integrated  gaming  strategy  and  has launched  Vault,  an  experimental  online  retail  destination showcasing  restored  and  customized  Gucci  vintage  pieces  and giving voice to young talented designers and trendsetting brands.\n\nThe retail network footprint remained almost stable, while being continuously enhanced through the ongoing roll-out of the store concept  and  innovative  forms  of  experiences,  including  Gucci Namiki  Tokyo,  Gucci  Gaok  in  Seoul  and  ephemeral  'pop-up' spaces. Meanwhile,  the  online  channel  delivered  another outstanding  year.  The  e-commerce  offer  has  been  extended  to the  full  product  catalogue,  facilitating  seamless  omni-channel experiences  and  establishing  a  retention  and  loyalty  framework through  MyGucci  registration.  The  Gucci  9  global  client  service center  played  a  strategic  role  in  providing  remote  clienteling services, powered with new functionalities and extended to new countries. As for travel retail, the brand focused on reviewing its locations  to  account  for  the  new  traffic  flows  that  have  been accelerated by the pandemic.\n\nIn  the  wholesale  channel,  Gucci  progressed  in  reducing  its footprint,  while  also  moving  forward  with  the  conversion  of strategically relevant accounts to a concession or retail model, both on- and offline,  with  the  overall  goal  being  to  increase control over distribution.\n\nGucci continued its contribution to environmental and social sustainability.  Alongside  its  reaffirmed  commitment  to  be carbon  neutral  in  all  its  operations,  Gucci  surpassed  2025 reduction target four years ahead of time. The House renewed its  support  to  programs  aimed  at  protecting  and  restoring nature, including investments in regenerative agriculture, and increased the use of recycled raw materials and organic fibers launching  Demetra,  a  new  revolutionary  luxury  material  that combines efficient processes with animal free raw materials.\n\nGucci  is  confident  in  its  business  strategy  and  aims  to  further consolidate  its  leadership  position  within  the  luxury  industry  in 2022 returning to the Milan Fashion Week calendar, reinforcing its distinctive company culture and further enhancing its brand equity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Originally a House of  Haute Couture, the Maison revolutionized the way fashion and society merge and interact in 1966 with the introduction of  high-end  clothes  produced  on  a  larger  scale  than  the exclusive collections.\n\nSince  then,  Saint  Laurent's  offer  has  expanded  to  include women's  and  men's  ready-to-wear,  shoes,  handbags,  small leather  goods,  jewelry,  scarves,  ties  and  eyewear,  defining  a highly desirable and contemporary silhouette.\n\nUnder  the  creative  vision  of  Anthony  Vaccarello  and  the leadership of Francesca Bellettini, Saint Laurent has built very strong foundations for sustainable, long-term growth. Much of the brand's success stems from its uncompromising approach  to  creativity,  quality  and  craftsmanship.  With  clear and  distinctive  codes  expressed  in  continually  compelling collections, Saint Laurent has become one of the most desired brands  in  luxury.  This  desirability  will  continue  to  grow  as Saint Laurent offers more premium items in every category.\n\nThrough  its  network  of  268  directly  operated  stores  as  of December 31, 2021, its digital platforms and carefully selected wholesale  clients,  Saint  Laurent  competes  globally  with  the\n\n## Key highlights 2021\n\n2021  has  proved  to  be  another  outstanding  year  for  Saint Laurent.  With  revenues  reaching  \u20ac2.5  billion,  the  House surpassed its pre-pandemic performance. The House delivered significant growth in all categories.\n\nSaint Laurent has achieved these results by remaining true to its  DNA,  communicating the unique codes of the House with relevance and authenticity.\n\nFor  several  years,  Saint  Laurent  has  focused  on  attracting, retaining  and  cultivating  relationships  with  local  clients  in every store around the world. By treating every customer as if they  were  a  local  client,  Saint  Laurent  personnel  have enhanced  the  brand's  desirability  while  improving  sales performance.\n\nThis  approach  not  only  protected  the  brand  when  tourist travel  was  stopped  by  the  pandemic,  but  it  has  also  seen clients  return  enthusiastically  to  Saint  Laurent  stores  when they could do so once again.\n\nIn 2021, Saint Laurent opened 29 stores worldwide, of which 9 stores in Greater China, significantly expanding its presence in  this  essential  market  for  luxury.  The  House  is  well positioned  for  further  growth  in  China,  with  its  network  of existing stores serving local clients in key cities and potential opportunities for new store openings.\n\nmost exclusive luxury brands. Focus on retail excellence and the establishment of strong customer relationships have been strategic priorities for Saint Laurent for several years. Passion for  excellence  inspires  everyone  at  Saint  Laurent  and  the House has trained client advisors around the world to provide every customer with an exceptional experience. Saint Laurent will continue to invest in staff training, technology and channels optimization to further enhance the brand experience.\n\nBehind  the  scenes,  Saint  Laurent  is  coordinating  production and logistics  more  efficiently  than  ever  before.  The  House  is adding  further  production  capacity  for  shoes  and  ready  to wear  to  its  atelier  in  Angers  (France).  It  is  also  developing  a new center of excellence for leather goods production in Italy which  is  expected  to  open  in  2023.  Saint  Laurent  will  also leverage Kering's new logistics hub in Northern Italy next year. These investments in state-of-the-art facilities will keep Saint Laurent at the forefront of the industry.\n\nThough  the  House  achieved  record  results  in  2021,  there  is still significant  potential  to  expand  sales  and  enhance business  performance.  Saint  Laurent  is  confident  in  the opportunities for sustainable growth.\n\nSaint Laurent also opened new stores in Europe, the Americas and the Middle East, which all present excellent opportunities for business development, while having materially contributed to the 2021 performances.\n\nIn  addition  to  improving  client  service  and  developing  the boutique  network,  the  brand  increased  its  control  over distribution  in  2021.  By  reducing  the  number  of  wholesale doors and operating more in-store concessions, Saint Laurent reinforced the luxury positioning of the brand and fostered a consistent customer experience.\n\nThe  House  has  extended  its  control  to  online  sales  as  well. Saint  Laurent  significantly  upgraded  its  own  digital  platform while  also  taking  more  direct  control  of  sales  through  third party  online  retailers.  This  approach  has  allowed  better management of inventory, pricing and merchandising online.\n\nSaint Laurent continues to enhance its position as a high-luxury house through the introduction of more premium products in each category.\n\nSaint  Laurent  is  exceptionally  proud  of  the  commitment colleagues  across  the  organization  have  shown  throughout the  year.  The  focus  on  fundamentals  has  delivered  strong results and positioned the House for continued success.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Matthieu Blazy,  who  has  been  the  Ready-to-wear  Director  at  Bottega Veneta  since  2020,  has  been  appointed  as  Creative  Director in  2021.  With  a  natural  instinct  aligned  with  the  essence  of Bottega Veneta, he has embraced Bottega Veneta's core values and  will  continue  to  enhance  the  modern  relevance  of  the House.\n\nOne of the foundations of the brand success in recent years has  been  the  evolution  of  Bottega  Veneta  from  a  leather house to a luxury fashion house, with collections highlighting a full silhouette and a wider range of products appealing to an international  clientele  of  men  and  women.  This  strategy  has\n\n## Key highlights 2021\n\nBottega  Veneta  achieved  a  record  milestone,  closing  2021 with the highest ever revenues in its history. Bottega Veneta's strong momentum was fueled by increased brand desirability, coveted  collections  and  positive  reception  of  the  brand's creativity.  This  solid  performance  was  achieved  in  a  context where  the  COVID-19  crisis  persevered  and  where  the  store network and key geographies continued to suffer from some closures and lack of tourism flow.\n\nIn the first quarter, Bottega Veneta, in line with its positioning, launched  the  digital  journal  'Issue',  highlighting  the  work  of highly acclaimed  collaborators,  in  art  forward  formats including  photography,  film,  illustrations  and  music,  after opting out of Instagram.\n\nIn April, Bottega Veneta held the Salon 02 show in Berlin. The collection  was  disruptive  in  its  modernity,  emphasizing  the tension  between  tradition  and  innovation,  with  new  designs inspired from intrecciato continuing to emerge.\n\nDuring the year, Bottega Veneta accelerated flagship openings (Tokyo Omotesando, Rome Via Condotti, New York Soho) and creative  pop-up  stores  often  in  unexpected  locations  (New York's  Williamsburg  and  London's  Shoreditch).  Additionally, the  e-commerce  channel  was  fully  insourced  to  promote ownership of the end-to-end client journey, stock optimization, faster delivery options and digital growth.\n\nIn its quest to continuously promote creativity, Bottega Veneta developed  highly  unexpected  media  campaigns.  The  House showcased its campaigns on the Bund tower in Shanghai, over Los Angeles airport rooftops to be viewed from the sky and at the iconic Bondi Beach pool in Sydney (Australia).\n\npropelled Bottega Veneta into new territories: while continuing to embrace discretion, the brand is engaging with a broader audience to unveil its full potential while continuing to maintain a very balanced mix of new client recruitment and existing client retention. In addition to the intrecciato , Bottega Veneta  has  been  successful  in  establishing  new  highly recognizable  codes  and  icons  that  are  regarded  as  the pinnacle  of  creativity  and  craftsmanship  and  have  become highly desirable globally.\n\nThe business and creative leadership duo are working hand in hand  to  increase  brand  desirability  and  awareness  with  a focus  on  long  term  organic  growth.  Additionally,  a  value strategy  has  been  implemented,  focusing  on  full  price  sales alongside a controlled and exclusive distribution strategy.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Bottega  Veneta  retail  network consists  of  263  directly  operated  stores  across  all  key geographies,  e-commerce  capabilities  across  45  countries, complemented  by  select  multi-brand  boutiques,  exclusive department and specialty stores worldwide. At the end of 2021, Bottega  Veneta's  product  mix  was  very  well  balanced  and further  evolved  to  expand  ready-to-wear  and  shoes,  which continue to increase their share in the brand's revenue.\n\nIn  October,  Bottega  Veneta  unveiled  its  Salon  03  show  in Detroit  to  an  audience  of  300  influential  individuals  hailing from  diverse  walks  of  the  entertainment  world  such  as  art, cinema,  music,  and  sports.  The  show,  inspired  by  American design  and  workwear,  was  livestreamed  in  a  Times  Square takeover and was accompanied by a pop-up store in a historic Detroit firehouse alongside local opinion leaders.\n\nIn  the  fourth  quarter,  Matthieu  Blazy  was  appointed  as Creative  Director.  Matthieu  was  the  Ready-to-wear  Designer for Bottega Veneta since 2020, and having designed under the helm of Raf Simons, Maison Martin Margiela and C\u00e9line, has an extraordinary creative background and wealth of experience.\n\nIn December, Bottega Veneta launched 'Bottega for Bottegas' and passed on its global visibility assets (coveted advertising spaces,  website,  newsletters,  and  store  windows)  to  twelve Italian artisan shops to propel their creativity on a global level.\n\nFor 2022, the House will continue to emphasize its ultra-high-end luxury  positioning  at  the  intersection  of  creativity  and craftsmanship. The House will maintain its focus on value and exclusive distribution. Transformative brand moments will be prioritized,  beginning  with  the  first  Matthieu  Blazy  collection presented  in  Italy  in  February.  The  retail  experience  will continue  to  be  enhanced,  with  strategic  new  store  openings and existing network enhancement. To support the remarkable success of the shoe category, Bottega Veneta will open a new Atelier specializing in shoes in Veneto, in line with the  House's  aesthetic  characterized  by  extraordinary  design, exceptional quality and expert craftsmanship.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Balenciaga's technique, masterful cut and constant innovation in its use of fabrics has helped it carve out a unique place in Fashion and Couture.\n\nFrom the 1990s to the early 2000s, the brand experienced a re-birth, extending its product universe beyond its core readyto-wear  segment  to  include  handbags  and  the  development  of new lines of shoes and accessories. Balenciaga also significantly expanded  its  retail  network,  helping  to  bolster  brand  awareness around the globe.\n\nDemna was appointed Artistic Director of Balenciaga in October 2015.  His  innovative  approach  combined  with  mastery  of techniques  and  use  of  volumes  make  him  a  powerful  force  in today's creative world. As Artistic Director, he has begun writing a new chapter in Balenciaga's history, embracing Balenciaga's values and developing them in a modern and relevant way.\n\n## Key highlights 2021\n\nIn  line  with  the  brand's  positioning  and  strategy,  2021  saw  the expansion  of  Balenciaga's  store  network  in  both  mature  markets (Western Europe, the United States and Japan) as well as in Asia.\n\nAs of end-2021, the House had a network of 223 stores including in several  new  countries  such  as  Austria,  Netherlands, Switzerland and New Zealand.\n\nSignificant milestones were achieved in 2021, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 The Hacker Project that presented conceptual interpretations of  Gucci's  recognizable  signatures  as  Balenciaga  products, merging both Houses' codes for a ground-breaking collaboration.\n- \u00b7 The launch of a multi-pronged creative partnership with the award-winning online gaming platform Fortnite, proposing within the game via a virtual store skins, outfits, and iconic products.\n- \u00b7 The Balenciaga's Summer 2022 presentation that included The  Simpsons  I  Balenciaga  products  and  pushed  certain boundaries  set  up  between  fashion  and  other  forms  of entertainment, culture, and technology, shifting the brand away from an easily definable category.\n\nThe  recent  relaunch  of  Haute  Couture  after  a  50-year  hiatus further consolidated the positioning of the House's status as a fashion authority.\n\nDemna's vision is also encompassed in various collaborations with artists, cultural and technological partners, and also with other brands.\n\nRetail  and  e-commerce  development  has  been  the  House's priority  in  recent  years  diminishing  its  wholesale  presence. While the House pursued its retail expansion with new stores and renovation  of  existing  ones,  the  Balenciaga  online  store  was also migrated to a new and directly controlled platform. This internalization  opened  business  development  opportunities, through omnichannel abilities and time to market improvements.\n\nOver the years, the House has increased its presence on social media,  highlighting  their  importance  in  its  development,  for instance  to  present  its  collections  online,  impressing  clients and boosting their engagement.\n\n- \u00b7 The relaunch of Haute Couture took place in July in Paris with a  further  exhibition  in  Shanghai  in  November.  Additionally, the Balenciaga Couture Salon was established at the House's historical headquarters, 10 avenue George V, connecting the past with the present and further extending the heritage of the House.\n- \u00b7 Demna's achievements with Balenciaga were further recognized by the Fashion Industry as he received several awards in 2021, such as the International Womens' Designer of the Year Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.\n- \u00b7 In October 2021 and January 2022, the Lyst Index, a quarterly ranking of fashion's hottest brands and products, revealed that Balenciaga was the world's hottest brand.\n\n2022  will  see  Balenciaga  continue  consolidating  its  retail presence worldwide and developing further significant projects with other artists and partners.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the brand expanded its  online  presence  through  the  launch  of  a  few  concession stores. Creatively, the brand  launched  6  seasonal  icon collections  in  conjunction  with  43  diverse  and  emerging collaborators from around the world.\n\nDuring the year, Alexander McQueen also took part to a circular resale collaboration with Vestiaire Collective and continued to be committed to philanthropic endeavors, including a new student fabric  donations  scheme,  sponsorship  of  the  Tower  Hamlets youth creative group 'A Team Arts Education' and an educational project  with  young  people  in  the  Welsh  valleys.

The collection  attracted  a  great  deal  of  attention  in  Cannes,  and was developed in close collaboration with Saint Gobain using a method of processing rock crystal that is totally novel in the High Jewelry industry.

The House  is  famous  for  its  connections  with  the  world  of  sailing: traditionally,  its  horological  instruments  used  onboard  ships  were among the world's most reliable. It has pioneered the innovative use of  materials,  and  is  one  of  the  few  watchmakers  capable  of producing  its  own  components  and  movements,  with  innovation central  to  its  designs.  Today,  Ulysse  Nardin  has  four  collections: Marine,  Diver,  Blast  and  Freak .  The  House  seeks  to  preserve  the marine  environments  in  which  it  made  its  name  through  a commitment to reducing plastic pollution and protecting the shark, which is its emblem.\n\n## Key highlights 2021\n\nUlysse  Nardin  celebrated  its  175 th anniversary  in  2021.  The  year centered  around  two  main  launches:  a  range  of  high-tech horological  objects  featuring  futuristic  design,  and  a  heritage capsule collection that pays tribute to the House's nautical past. At the  same  time,  the  Ulysse  Nardin  distribution  network  was strengthened  with  the  closure  of  non-strategic  partner  stores, growth in key accounts and the opening of new single-brand stores, particularly in China. As a result, the Ulysse Nardin network had six own stores and six franchise stores at the end of 2021. In 2022, the House  is  preparing  to  launch  a  new  cutting-edge  timepiece:  the ultimate version of its iconic FREAK watch.\n\nFounded in 1791\n\n## Business concept and strategy\n\nGirard-Perregaux is an Atelier of Haute Horlogerie based in the cradle of watchmaking La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Founded in 1791, Girard-Perregaux is one of the oldest fine watchmaking manufactures still  in  operation  and  masters  all  the  required  horological  skills in-house. The firm's history is dotted with exceptional creations that skillfully  blend  aesthetics  and  functionality.  These  models  include the iconic Laureato, born in 1975, as well as the legendary Tourbillon with  Three  Gold  Bridges.  Appreciated  by  those  in  the  know,  the Maison is very exclusive in terms of production and distribution and does everything with unique expertise and true passion.\n\n## Key highlights 2021\n\nIn  2021,  Girard-Perregaux  celebrated  its  230 th anniversary,  a  fitting testament to the brand's watchmaking expertise. While Girard-Perregaux respects  its  heritage,  it  continues  to  look  ahead,  embracing  new technologies such as rubber alloy, state-of-the-art materials such as enameling and fresh takes on iconic shapes. Moreover, the company has  become  the  Official  Watch  Partner  of  Aston  Martin,  working together  to  create  new  expressions  of  horology.  Among  the initiatives to build customer loyalty, the Maison invites clients to visit the  Manufacture  to  partake  in  an  immersive  experience  and discover more about this historical watch company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  2017,  a  partnership  agreement  with  Richemont was announced, resulting in new additions to Kering Eyewear's portfolio  and  Richemont  becoming  a  shareholder  of  the company.  Today,  Kering  Eyewear  designs,  develops  and distributes a unique portfolio of 16 brands.\n\nThe innovative business model anticipates and embraces the industry's  challenges,  and  creates  long-lasting  and  valuable partnerships  with  brands,  suppliers  and  clients.  A  fast  and\n\n## Key highlights 2021\n\nIn 2021, Kering Eyewear recovered strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic and returned to a very solid growth.\n\nThe  company  added  the  Chlo\u00e9  and  Dunhill  brands  to  its portfolio  and  successfully  rolled  out  their  first  collections, further reinforcing the alliance with Richemont.\n\nTo  present  new  collections  and  engage  with  clients,  both digital  and  physical  sales  events  were  hosted  worldwide, overcoming  the  cancellation  of  international  eyewear  trade fairs and the travel bans caused by Covid-19.\n\nTaking a step forward in its quest for innovation, the company launched the 'Blue & Beyond' project, realizing ready-to-wear blue  light  reduction  and  photochromic  lenses  in  multiple colors for selected brands in the portfolio.\n\nagile decision-making process and a close collaboration with the  brands,  from  the  design  process  to  marketing  and communications activities, create synergies when developing eyewear, while preserving the DNA of each House.\n\nTo  ensure  product  excellence  and  the  highest  quality standards,  Kering  Eyewear  relies  on  the  best  manufacturers worldwide  and  two  production  plants,  Manufacture  Kering Eyewear in France, and Trenti S.p.A. in Italy.\n\nThrough a qualitative commercial and distribution approach, the  company  serves  around  20,000  customers  and  over 40,000  doors  worldwide  in  120  countries,  providing  the Houses  with  broad  market  coverage,  in  line  with  their positioning and desired visibility.\n\nIn  September,  Kering  Eyewear  completed  the  acquisition  of the Danish luxury eyewear brand LINDBERG, renowned for its exceptional titanium optical frames, design, innovative technology  and  impeccable  craftsmanship.  Adding  to  the portfolio a complementary and proprietary brand with strong legitimacy, undisputed know-how and best-in-class customer service  in  optical  frames,  the  acquisition  further  reinforces Kering Eyewear as the most relevant player in the luxury and high-end eyewear segment.\n\nKering  Eyewear  remains  committed  to  exploiting  the  full potential  of  all  its  brands,  both  in  the  sun  and  optical segments, as well as to further establishing its presence in its channels, leveraging its expertise and unique positioning.",

Many  of  Kering's  activities  rely  on  high-quality  raw materials and exceptional expertise, and so depend directly on balanced, smooth-running  ecosystems  and  respect  for individuals. Protecting resources and the planet, and having a positive impact on its employees, partners, suppliers and their communities,  is  therefore  vital  for  the  Group  to  continue growing  in  a  sustainable  way.  The  focus  on  sustainability  is also an opportunity to reinvent the Luxury industry as a whole, to devise a more sustainable and responsible form of Luxury.\n\nAccordingly, Kering is implementing an ambitious sustainability strategy for the period until 2025, based on three inputs:\n\n- \u00b7 the  vision  and  ambition  adopted  by  the  Group's  top management, i.e. to be the world's most influential Luxury group  in  terms  of  creativity,  sustainability  and  long-term economic performance;\n- \u00b7 a materiality analysis highlighting priority issues, consistent with  the  Group's  own  priorities  and  the  expectations  of stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 an  analysis  of  non-financial  risks,  pinpointing  the  main risks in all parts of the value chain.\n\nThe Group's objectives and actions are organized around three pillars  and  are  aligned  with  the  United  Nations'  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and with 12 of them in particular.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  strategy  is  being implemented within each of the Houses, which are translating the Group's objectives into practical action plans and reporting on  the  progress  made  with  respect  to  each  of  the  strategy's three pillars on a regular basis.\n\nMore than 20 specialists reporting to the Chief Sustainability and Institutional Affairs Officer - who is herself a member of the Executive Committee - assist the Houses with the implementation of the Group's strategy by systematically looking for potential synergies  and  continuous  improvement.  In  addition,  each House  has  at  least  one  Sustainability  Lead,  while  the  larger Houses have entire Sustainability teams. As a result, Kering's Sustainability team numbers more than 90 people.\n\nThe Board of Directors has also had a Sustainability Committee since 2012. This committee's brief is to assist and support the Group  in designing, implementing  and  monitoring  its sustainability strategy, along with its principles and practices regarding social and ethical responsibility.\n\nThe  Group  has  a  particularly  innovative  approach  to  taking environmental  issues  into  account.  Since  2012,  Kering  has developed  its  environmental  profit  and  loss  (EP&L)  account, which  is  a  reporting  tool  to  measure  and  quantify  its environmental footprint across the whole value chain. The tool enables  the  Group  to  understand  the  risks  and  opportunities related to environmental challenges, focusing on six themes: greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, water pollution, water consumption,  waste  production  and  land  use.  It  therefore helps Kering identify the main ways in which it can reduce its environmental footprint. Kering has undertaken to reduce its EP&L  intensity  by  40%  by  2025  compared  with  2015.  The Group's environmental approach is based on three complementary aspects: climate, biodiversity and circularity.\n\nKering has identified the environmental impacts in each stage of its value chain, as set out after.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 8.3 Climate risks fully integrated into the business strategy\n\nKering has made climate action a key part of its strategy. The Group's  2021  EP&L  results  show  that  37%  of  Kering's environmental  impacts  relate  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions. Given the link between climate protection and the long-term viability of its business, the Group takes into account material climate-related  risks  (physical  risks  and  transition  risks)  in order to achieve greater resilience. To address these risks, the Group has developed a climate strategy  based  on  four  main aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 Mitigating  climate-related  risks  by  reducing  emissions : Kering has designed its targets according to the reference framework  defined  by  the  Science  Based  Target  Initiative (SBTi) and is committed to a 90% reduction in its absolute greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  its  operations  (scopes  1 and  2)  by  2030,  along  with  a  70%  reduction  per  unit  of value  added  in  emissions  connected  to  its  supply  chains (scope 3).\n- \u00b7 Achieving  adaptation  and  resilience  with  nature-based solutions : the  Group  favors  sourcing  materials  from regenerative agriculture, which aims to protect and restore biodiversity and soil health.\n- \u00b7 Offsetting  and  achieving  'net  zero': Kering  has  made  a commitment  to  offsetting  residual  emissions  from  all  of\n\nthe Group's own activities and those of its supply chain, and has set a target of achieving net zero by 2050.\n\n- \u00b7 Industry transformation: through partnerships and coalitions  like  OP2B  and  the  Fashion  Pact,  Kering  aims  to develop a new, holistic approach to managing climate-related risks,  mitigating  their  impact  and  contributing  to  global climate-related objectives.\n\nKering  has  been  a  member  of  the  TCFD  (Task  Force  on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) since 2017. It monitors the work done by the TCFD and follows its recommendations. In 2021, the Group mapped 19 risks and opportunities related to  climate  change.  An  initial  impact  assessment  covering  a selection  of  those  risks  and  opportunities  was  carried  out, with  the  help  of  scenarios  developed  on  the  basis  of  two assumptions involving 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C trajectories. The details of this initial exercise are provided in Chapter 4, \"Sustainability\".\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  commitments  in  terms  of  climate action, a decision was made in 2021 to appoint a member of the Board of Directors as climate change lead with effect from 2022  and  to  add  the  topic  as  an  agenda  point  at  Board meetings twice a year.\n\n## 8.4 Our main achievements in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 41% reduction in our environmental footprint (EP&L intensity 2015-21)\n- \u00b7  Scope of our environmental footprint extended to cover product use and end of life\n- \u00b7  Alignment of our Climate strategy with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory\n- \u00b7 Traceability achieved for 90% of our key raw materials\n- \u00b7  First seven projects receiving grants from the Regenerative Fund for Nature , which will support a transition to regenerative practices on more than 840,000 hectares of land and directly benefit 60,000 people\n- \u00b7  Decision to stop the use of animal fur in all Group Houses\n\n## COLLABORATE\n\n- \u00b7 56% women managers\n- \u00b7 1 3 Inclusion & Diversity committees in each Group entity and sponsored by management committee members\n- \u00b7 82% participation rate in the Kering People Survey in 2021\n- \u00b7  Adoption of a global policy on domestic violence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Introduction of innovative new materials: Gucci Demetra\n- \u00b7  Publication of 'Coming Full Circle', a report that sets out our new ambitions for promoting a global\n- approach to the circular economy\n- \u00b7 New business models (e.g. AMQ/ Vestiaire Collective collaboration)\n- \u00b7  Publication of our human rights policy\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to manage, anticipate and mitigate its risk exposure, and to ensure that it can develop its business sustainably over the long term, the Group has set up a risk management system that involves three lines of defense.\n\n## THE THREE LINES OF DEFENSE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First line of defense: day-to-day risk management\n\nThe  first  line  of  defense  involves  managing  risk.  All  Kering employees manage risk in their day-to-day work, overseen by operational managers who are responsible for internal control measures and who must ensure that those measures reduce risk to an acceptable level.\n\nAccordingly, the first line of defense must:\n\n- \u00b7 identify, assess, control and mitigate risks by defining and implementing internal rules and procedures;\n- \u00b7 take remedial action to address process and control failures;\n- \u00b7 oversee  the  way  in  which  teams  apply  and  formalize controls  in  the  Group's  accounts  closing  and  compliance systems.\n\n## Second line of defense: day-to-day risk monitoring\n\nThe second line of defense consists of functions that measure and qualify risks, then ensure that they are properly covered.\n\nThose functions must:\n\n- \u00b7 develop risk management guidelines;\n- \u00b7 identify known and emerging problems and deal with alerts relating  to  them,  as  well  as  changes  in  the  way  risks  are regulated;\n- \u00b7 issue  directives  and  provide  training  in  risk  management procedures;\n\n- 62\n\n- \u00b7 facilitate monitoring regarding the implementation of effective risk procedures and controls devised by management;\n- \u00b7 ensure that Group's risk assessment approach is implemented at the process level by regional internal control officers;\n- \u00b7 test  control  activities  through  self-assessments  and  peer reviews,  and  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control using tools.\n\n## Third line of defense: independent risk management\n\nInternal  audit  is  the  third  line  of  defense.  It  independently performs risk management operations. Internal audit periodically assesses the design and effectiveness of the first two lines of defense and helps improve the internal control system through its recommendations.\n\nAccordingly, the third line of defense must:\n\n- \u00b7 depending on the issue, check that the measures in place, including governance methods, comply with regulatory and statutory requirements;\n- \u00b7 carry  out  audits  by  observing  practices,  speaking  to  staff members  involved  in  audit  activities  and  preparing  audit reports;\n- \u00b7 analyze and check the effectiveness of existing control and financial reporting procedures;\n- \u00b7 define  an  annual  internal  audit  plan  with  the  Group's governance bodies (Board of Directors and Audit Committee).",

The scale of the recession varied, however,  depending  on  the  regions  concerned. Globally, the crisis peaked in the second quarter of 2020, with lockdown  measures  and  travel  restrictions  weighing  very heavily  on  the  world's  main  economies.  But  after  the pandemic reached its early-2020 heights, and as restrictions began to ease, economic activity bounced back in the spring in Asia - particularly in China - and then during the summer for the world's mature economies. The recovery was more gradual during  the  second  half  of  2020  in  countries  where  the  virus was circulating rapidly,  as  new  restrictions  were  put  in  place (such  as  regional  lockdowns  and  curfews),  especially  in Western Europe.\n\nIn the first few months of 2021, although Europe - and, to a lesser extent, some Asian countries and North America - were subject to general or targeted restrictions on movement and business in the winter due to the public health situation, the economic  rebound  continued,  and  a  V-shaped  recovery seemed to be taking place. Developments in the pandemic in the second half of the year, particularly the rapid spread of the Omicron variant  and  an  increase  in  COVID-19  cases  in  China during the summer and at the end of the year, do not seem to have  affected  global  growth  very  materially.  As  a  result,  the world economy may have grown by 5.8%, boucing back above its pre-pandemic level (2019).\n\nAsia was one of the main drivers of the recovery, and to a very large  extent  this  was  attributable  to  China,  whose  economy was one of a small number to achieve growth in 2020 (2.3%). In 2021, China's economy may have grown by a further 8.0%. That upturn would have been even stronger had it not been for the summer slowdown caused by measures to contain the resurgence  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  or  the  difficulties encountered by companies in the real-estate and construction sectors. Other than Japan, Asia's other large economies - and primarily South Korea - generated very robust growth, having also  been  less  affected  than  Western  countries  by  the  crisis in 2020.\n\nIn  North  America and Western Europe, growth was driven by firm  consumer  spending.  Households'  real  incomes  were boosted by economic support measures, particularly furlough arrangements  and  financial  aid  for  families  based  on  their income  levels.  At  the  same  time,  large-scale  recovery  plans announced  in  the  United  States  and  the  European  Union should also help sustain the rebound in consumer spending and business activity. Looking at trends in the fourth quarter of 2021, the withdrawal of some types of support, particularly in  North  America,  and  growing  inflationary  pressure  do  not seem to be adversely affecting demand at this stage.\n\nFirm  consumer  spending  is  partly  the  result  of  higher disposable incomes, caused by social transfers and pay rises in some sectors, but also by consumers spending savings built up in the previous months - with excess savings representing between 5% and 11% of GNP in Western economies since the start of 2020 depending on the data source concerned - while monetary  policies  have  remained  accommodative  until recently.\n\nIn  2021  as  a  whole,  therefore,  developed  countries  are  likely to  have  seen  economic  growth  of  5.1%.  The  US  economy  is estimated to have grown by 5.6% following a rapid acceleration in  the  fourth  quarter,  taking  GDP  back  above  its  2019  level. Eurozone  economies  are  recovering  more  strongly  than expected,  with  overall  growth  of  5.1%  estimated  in  2021, although GDP remains around 1.7% below its pre-crisis figure. Japan, meanwhile, is likely to show a more modest rebound, with its economy growing by around 1.8%.\n\nWhile the economic recovery has boosted the world trade in goods, the global services industry has been - and remains severely  weighed  down  by  travel  restrictions,  affecting  both international  and  domestic  travel,  especially  in  Asia.  The transport,  hospitality  and  tourism  sectors  have  been  heavily impacted by the slump in travel. The recovery is expected to be very gradual, as illustrated by the projections issued by ACI (Airports Council  International)  in  November  2021,  which forecast  that  overall  (domestic  and  international)  passenger traffic will not return to 2019 levels until 2024.\n\n## The luxury industry - overcoming the crisis of 2020\n\nDomestic  consumer  spending  was  strong  in  2021,  while consumer confidence moved close to the level seen in 2019, at  least  before  the  Omicron  variant  emerged  (source:  OECD), and these factors clearly drove the luxury industry's growth in 2021.  On  the  downside,  the  lack  of  tourism  is  adversely affecting  the  luxury  industry,  especially  in  markets  where purchases  by  tourists  were  a  significant  revenue  contributor until 2019. However, the weakness of tourist demand - which fell\n\nby  80-90% overall  according  to  Bain  &  Company  /  Altagamma (1) (the  source  of  information  in  this  section  unless  otherwise mentioned) - did not prevent the luxury market from recovering.\n\nLuxury brands' sales may have rebounded by 31% at constant exchange rates relative to 2020, when they fell by around 22%. The  recovery  was  strongest  in  the  first  half  of  the  year,  and particularly  in  the  second  quarter,  due  to  the  extremely  low base for comparison.\n\n- 64",

        "page_content": "However,  given  the  highly  atypical  nature  of  2020,  the  most meaningful comparison for luxury brands is with 2019, when the luxury market saw record sales. Forecasts seem to suggest that 2021 revenues outstripped those seen in 2019. Compared to  2019,  the  increase  is  expected  to  be  4%  at  constant exchange rates according to Bain & Company / Altagamma, but according to the most optimistic estimates - focusing on the industry's  largest  players  -  growth  may  have  been  close to  10%.  The  most  positive  scenarios  could  be  borne  out  by figures  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  which  seems  to  have been a particularly strong period for the luxury industry.\n\nHowever,  performances  varied  from  one  region  to  another in  2021.  In  Mainland  China  and  the  United  States,  the aforementioned macroeconomic factors spurred rapid revenue  growth,  while  growth  in  other  Asian  markets  was more  mixed,  depending  partly  on  how  badly  consumer spending was affected by measures implemented to combat the  pandemic.  However,  South  Korea  stood  out:  market volumes recovered to 2019 levels, which was a record year in terms  of  sales  to  Chinese  customers.  In  Western  Europe meanwhile,  sales  to  domestic  customers  were  good  and improved throughout 2021, but were not sufficient to offset the  region's  low  tourist  numbers  and  the  impact  of  store closures,  primarily  at  the  start  of  the  year.  Sales  in  Japan remained  hampered  by  the  ongoing  effect  of  Chinese customers shifting their spending to Mainland China and by an uncertain economic and health environment that weighed on demand from local customers. The upturn seen in the last few months  of  2021  resulted  from  the  improved  trend  in consumer  spending,  but  also  partly  from  favorable  base effects relative to two years previously, since the VAT increase on October 1, 2019 adversely affected demand.\n\nAgainst  this  backdrop,  a  number  of  secular  developments  in the  luxury  industry  -  which  were  amplified  by  the  COVID-19 crisis  in  2020  -  made  their  mark  on  the  performance  of  the world's main luxury brands in 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 E-commerce  is  expected  once  again  to  be  the  fastestgrowing  distribution  channel  in  2021  (+27%  compared to 2020 but +89% versus 2019). The proportion of industry revenue  generated  by  online  sales  -  estimated  at  12% in  2019  -  may  have  reached  22%  in  2021.  In  addition, websites  directly  managed  by  brands  (Brand.com)  and e-concessions  (concessions  within  e-commerce  sites)  are likely  to  have  seen  particularly  strong  growth,  as  luxury houses  seek  to  gain  greater,  or  indeed  exclusive,  control over their distribution.\n- \u00b7 In  view  of  travel  restrictions,  demand  for  luxury  products was still mainly domestic. One of the most obvious signs of this is the shift in Chinese customers' demand to Mainland China,  and  sales  to  those  customers  is  likely  to  remain concentrated in Greater China for a long time to come.\n- \u00b7 Looking  at  sales  by  nationality,  however,  we  see  that  the largest increase in luxury brands' sales since 2019 has been with American customers. For Chinese customers, the surge in  sales  within  China  does  not  yet  appear  sufficient  to offset the decline in sales generated from Chinese tourists in Asia and Western Europe until 2019.\n- \u00b7 The  combination  of  lower  store  footfall  due  to  the expansion of e-commerce, extremely low tourist numbers, and the high proportion of domestic customers is affecting the organizational structure and management of distribution networks.  Brands  are  highly  focused  on  the  customer experience,  which  requires  heightened  attention  to  the quantity and quality of interactions with customers as well as  the  invention  of  new  forms  of  clienteling,  underpinned by  optimal  use  of  customer  data  and  CRM  systems. Distribution  is  becoming  increasingly  exclusive,  which means  that  the  revenue  contribution  of  the  wholesale channel is gradually decreasing, in a context in which Travel Retail  is  also  being  heavily  impacted  by  a  steep  decline in  international  air  traffic.  For  example,  the  offline  sales of  multibrand  retailers  fell  by  15-20%  between  2019 and 2021, while Travel Retail sales slumped by around 60%.\n- \u00b7 In  the  short  and  medium  term,  demand  from  Chinese customers and from Generations Y and Z will continue to be the main growth drivers for the global luxury market. For example, Chinese demand could account for about 40-45% of  the  global  market  as  soon  as  2025,  and  it  is  estimated that  Generation  Z  will  represent  at  least  70%  of  market demand by 2025 as opposed to a little over 60% in 2021. Because this new generation of customers has its own set of values, new imperatives have emerged for the industry's players.  For  instance,  it  has  become  essential  to  have  a clear  sustainability  strategy  that  takes  into  account  the whole value chain.\n- \u00b7 Compared to 2020, all product categories posted relatively similar increases in sales (c.25-30%) in 2021. However, the comparison with 2019 shows very robust growth in shoes, leather  goods  and  jewelry,  whereas  sales  in  the  watches segment appear stable and ready-to-wear saw a decline.\n- \u00b7 It  is  highly probable that the polarization that was already happening in the market will become greater in the coming years,  accompanied  by  mergers  and  acquisitions.  The greater complexity of developing and managing a brand in a  market  that  is  global,  but  at  the  same  time  more fragmented  than  before  (given  the  focus  on  local customers), means that large multi-brand groups that can pool  their  resources  and  investments  in  many  domains have a greater competitive advantage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recurring  operating  income  also rose  compared  to  2019  and  although  Group  profitability  did not  return  to  its  2019  level,  it  was  nevertheless  very  high. Consequently, cash flow generation was particularly solid and the Group reported a record-low debt-to-equity ratio.\n\nKering's performance clearly shows that it has come through the  crisis  even  stronger  than  before.  The  Group  is  squarely focused  on  investing  in  its  Houses  to  capitalize  on  their potential and return to a profitable growth trajectory.\n\nHowever,  the  Group's  operations  were  still  directly  and indirectly impacted by the pandemic and its effects in 2021.\n\nStore  footfall  was  adversely  affected  by  partial  or  total closures resulting from lockdowns and curfews, mainly in the first half of the year. On average, 17% of the store network was closed during the first quarter of the year, 13% in the second, 4% in  the  third  and  2%  in  the  fourth.  The  collapse  in  global tourist numbers relative to 2019 also continued to drag down business levels in some markets, particularly Western Europe and  Asia.  However,  again  compared  to  2019,  footfall  trends improved  considerably  during  the  year,  driven  by  local customers. In addition, the main retail performance indicators - and primarily the conversion rate - rose sharply in 2021 as a result of numerous initiatives aimed at improving the in-store customer  experience  and  strengthening  clienteling  activities. In addition, the Group's brands benefited from the omnichannel  strategy  that  they  have  been  implementing  in recent years, and were able to take full advantage of growth in online retail, which was clearly boosted by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nWhereas in 2020 lockdown measures temporarily reduced the Group's  ability  to  design,  manufacture  and  distribute  its products under normal conditions, in 2021 brands were able\n\nto  adapt  their  organizational  structures  to  public  health measures and restrictions on movement and to manage their operations with maximum efficiency.\n\nHowever,  due  to  delays  in  developing  collections  in  2020, postponements of some product launches and projects, and brands' highly prudent inventory management throughout the year,  the  depth  and  breadth  of  the  Group's  in-store  offering was temporarily reduced in some cases, not only in 2020 but also  in  the  first  half  and  to  some  extent  the  third  quarter of  2021.  Nevertheless,  all  of  the  measures  put  in  place  by brands to  return  to  a  more  normal  environment  in  terms  of creating  and  making  products,  combined  with  the  launch  of their  new  collections,  gradually  paid  off,  enabling  them  to propose broader offerings and meet customer demand across all the Houses' points of sale, particularly in the fourth quarter.\n\nAs  in  2020,  home-working  was  widely  used  thanks  to  the quality of the Group's information systems. This meant that all of the main departments and units, both for the brands and the  Group  as  a  whole,  could  continue  to  manage  major transformation  projects  effectively,  in  terms  of  both  IT systems and logistics.\n\nHowever, without calling into question the plan to expand the Houses' store network, some store openings or refurbishments had  to  be  postponed  due  to  difficulties  in  concluding negotiations with property owners and launching building works as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 situation in the first half.\n\nLastly,  while  keeping  a  tight  rein  on  costs,  the  Group  and  its brands  decided  to  allocate  the  necessary  resources  to  make the most of the upswing in business in the first half of 2021. Accordingly,  store  operating  costs  as  well  as  budgets  for communications,  upgrading  IT  systems  and  developing  the brands' digital platforms (encompassing e-commerce) increased during the period for all of the Group's Houses.\n\n## Rebound in Group business levels in 2021 and excellent operational and financial management\n\nThe  Group's  consolidated  revenue  for  2021  amounted  to \u20ac17,645 million, an increase of 34.7% as reported (up 35.2% at constant  scope  and  exchange  rates).  Revenue  was  13.4% higher than in 2019 on a comparable basis. The Group's sales for  each  quarter  of  the  year  were  higher  than  in  2019  (on  a comparable basis), and growth accelerated considerably in the fourth  quarter.  Relative  to  2020,  sales  growth  was  naturally very  strong  in  the  first  half  (up  54.1%)  but  remained outstanding  in  the  second  half  (up  22.6%),  driven  by  an excellent fourth quarter.\n\nRecurring operating income for 2021 came in at \u20ac5,017 million, 60.0%  higher  than  in  2020  and  5.0%  higher  than  in  2019. Recurring  operating  margin  came  to  28.4%,  up  4.5  points year-on-year.\n\nThis  improvement  was  due  to  a  very  favorable  operating leverage  effect,  with  sales  growth  exceeding  the  increase  in the  cost  base.  However,  the  Group's  Houses  and  various businesses  continued  to  invest  during  the  period  to  support\n\ntheir  development  and  expansion,  notably  by  increasing budgets for store expenses, creation, development, communications  and  information  systems  in  line  with  the industry's accelerating digital transformation. These initiatives were once again accompanied by strict cost-control measures for  other  expense  items,  including  rent  renegotiations  with landlords due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn  view  of  the  rise  in  consolidated  revenue  in  2021  and  the ensuing increase in recurring operating income for all of the Group's  businesses,  as  well  as  the  mid-term  outlook  for  the luxury  market,  no  impairment  losses  had  to  be  recognized against  non-current  assets  in  addition  to  those  recorded in 2020. Non-recurring items in 2021 mainly consisted of the estimated  loss  on  the  disposal  of  the  watches  brands, impairment of intangible assets relating to information systems, and litigation and restructuring costs, none of which had any direct  or  indirect  connection  with  the  pandemic.  The  sale  of the  watches  brands  resulted  from  a  strategic  review  of  the Group's business portfolio that began before the pandemic.",

        "page_content": "Impairment  losses  on  current  assets  (inventories  and  trade receivables) were recognized as usual under recurring operating expenses. The Group's credit risk - which was deemed to be very moderate and under control in 2020 - decreased in 2021.\n\nIn  2020,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  made  it  more  difficult  to calculate  corporate  income  tax,  as  the  overall  decrease  in profits seen by the vast majority of multinationals raised the question  of  how  profits  and  losses  should  be  allocated  by country.  This  issue  remains  outstanding,  as  recovery  trends are  varying  extremely  widely  from  one  region  to  another. However, as in 2020, Kering regarded it as reasonable to keep the  main  principles  of  its  current  transfer-pricing  policy,  in strict  compliance  with  the  rules  issued  by  the  OECD  and  the national  tax  authorities  in  each  of  the  countries  where  the Group operates. The Group is confident that its estimates as of December 31, 2021 are fair and prudent.\n\nLastly, the Group's financial position as of December 31, 2021 was  extremely  solid,  with  almost  zero  debt (1) and  good management  of  working  capital.  Cash  generation  reached  a record  level,  with  \u20ac3,948  million  in  free  cash  flow  from operations. This was achieved despite the fact that the Group kept  up  a  high  level  of  operating  investments,  which  were close to the 2019 figure (\u20ac934 million in 2021, equal to 5.3% of  2021  revenue).  Operating  investments  were  focused  on store  openings  and  refurbishments,  as  well  as  strategic logistics,  e-commerce  and  IT  programs  managed  by  the Corporate entity on behalf of the Houses.\n\nIn  light  of  the  Group's  strong  cash  flow  generation  in  2021, and also its effective cash management in 2020, liquidity risk was particularly low as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe  Group  did  not  identify  any  significant  events  in  2021 resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, whereas that was not the case in 2020.\n\n## 2 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 2021\n\n## Investment in Vestiaire Collective\n\nOn  March  1,  2021,  Kering  announced  that  it  had  acquired  a stake of around 5% in Vestiaire Collective, the leading global platform for desirable second-hand fashion, as part of a new \u20ac178 million financing round alongside a new shareholder, US investment firm Tiger Global Management. Existing shareholders including Vestiaire Collective's CEO Maximilian Bittner, Bpifrance, Cond\u00e9  Nast,  the  Eurazeo  group,  certain  funds  managed  by Fidelity  International,  Korelya  Capital,  Luxury  Tech  Fund  and Vitruvian Partners also reinvested.\n\nFollowing  a  strong  year  in  2020  that  saw  the  platform's transaction  volume  grow  over  100%  year-on-year,  this financing round granted Vestiaire Collective unicorn status and ideally positioned it for its next cycle of accelerated growth.\n\nBy  investing  in  Vestiaire  Collective  and  by  being  represented on the platform's Board of Directors, Kering is illustrating its pioneering strategy within its sector, which consists of supporting innovative  business  models,  embracing  new  market  trends and exploring new services for fashion and luxury customers.\n\n## Kering enhances its global logistics capabilities with a new hub in Northern Italy\n\nOn April 8, 2021, Kering announced the completion of the first phase  of  its  new  global  logistics  hub  in  Trecate,  in  the Piemonte region of Northern Italy. The first part of the building has  been  operating  since  March  2020,  and  the  second  part (over 100,000 sq.m) has come into service gradually since the third quarter of 2021.\n\nBuilt  in  record  time,  the  Group's  new  global  logistics  hub covers more than 162,000 sq.m (equivalent to 20 rugby fields) and  combines  state-of-the-art  technology  with  automation, scalability,  innovative  sustainability  and  features  for  the well-being of employees.\n\nThe  hub  will  meet  the  demand  from  the  Houses'  regional warehouses,  retail  stores,  wholesalers  and  e-commerce operations  worldwide,    and  will  significantly  increase  the Group's  capabilities  in  terms  of  shipping  (up  to  80  million pieces per year) and storage (up to 20 million pieces). It will also  reduce  lead  times  by  50%  by  increasing  the  speed  of deliveries and enhance collaboration with the Group's Houses.\n\nMore  than  250  people  are  currently  working  in  the  facility, with the total number of staff planned to reach approximately 900 by the end of 2022. The site is operated by XPO Logistics, Kering's  longstanding  logistics  partner,  which  employs  the on-site workforce dedicated to warehouse operations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  net  proceeds  of  the  transaction  have  been allocated  to  Kering's  general  corporate  purposes  and  have further strengthened its financial position.\n\n## Corporate governance at Kering\n\nAs a result of her changing roles within Exor, of which she is also a board member, and in order to avoid any potential conflict of interests, Ginevra Elkann resigned from her position as a member of Kering's Board of Directors as of April 27, 2021.\n\n## Kering Eyewear acquires the Danish luxury eyewear brand LINDBERG\n\nOn July 8, 2021, Kering Eyewear and the Lindberg family signed an  agreement  for  Kering  Eyewear  to  acquire  100%  of LINDBERG's  share  capital.  The  acquisition  was  completed  on September 30, 2021.\n\nLINDBERG was founded in 1969 in Denmark by optician PoulJ\u00f8rn  Lindberg  and  his  wife  as  an  optical  store,  and  it  was turned  into  a  multinational  company  by  their  son  Henrik. LINDBERG is now a high-end manufacturer of design-oriented, lightweight and customizable optical frames, and specializes in  titanium frames. The company's reputation has been built on  its  made-to-order  capabilities,  offering  customers  the possibility to create their very own bespoke pair of LINDBERG glasses through an extended modular system which contains billions  of  combinations,  in  a  wide  array  of  materials  from titanium to acetate, buffalo horn, wood and precious metals. LINDBERG  has  developed  and  patented  manufacturing techniques  and  innovations  such  as  hypoallergenic,  multiadjustable  and  screwless  frames  that  are  key  differentiating factors  in  the  high-end  eyewear  market.  LINDBERG  is  a genuine  pioneer  in  the  luxury  eyewear  industry  and  holds  a unique  position  within  it,  and  is  now  a  sizeable  and  very profitable company with strong growth potential.\n\nThis  acquisition  is  an  important  milestone  in  the  successful expansion  of  Kering  Eyewear  and  fits  perfectly  with  its development  strategy.  Since  its  launch  in  2014,  Kering Eyewear  has  built  an  innovative  business  model  that  has enabled  the  company  to  achieve  critical  size  in  its  market, with revenue of around \u20ac700 million in 2021. The acquisition will further strengthen Kering Eyewear's position as the most relevant  player  in  the  luxury  eyewear  segment,  adding  to  its portfolio a complementary and proprietary brand with strong legitimacy, undisputed know-how and best-in-class customer service in optical frames. Thanks to the good fit between their businesses,  both  companies  are  able  to  leverage  their respective strengths across the value chain, with synergies in distribution and geographical reach particularly This is helping to  accelerate  the  growth  and  enhance  the  profitability  of Kering Eyewear.\n\nLINDBERG's  entities  have  been  included  in  the  Group's consolidated financial statements since September 30, 2021. The  allocation  of  the  purchase  price  will  be  completed  in 2022.\n\n## Allocation of the first tranche of repurchased shares\n\nThe Group completed the first tranche of the stock repurchase program  that  it  announced  on  August  25,  2021.  The purchases  took  place  under  the  authorization  granted  by shareholders in the July 6, 2021 Annual General Meeting.\n\nBetween  August  25  and  November  3,  2021,  650,000  shares were repurchased at an average price of \u20ac643.70 per share, i.e. for a total of \u20ac418.4 million. Of the shares repurchased in that first  tranche,  325,000  were  canceled  on  December  10,  2021.\n\nThe  remaining  repurchased  shares  were  used  to  cover  free share plans for the Group's employees.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, the Group also repurchased 204,211 of its shares under authorizations granted by shareholders in the June 16, 2020 and April 22, 2021 AGMs. All of those shares were  allocated  to  covering  free  share  plans  and  other  longterm  incentive  plans  under  which  employees  receive  Kering shares.\n\n## Change of Creative Director at Bottega Veneta\n\nOn  November  10,  2021,  Bottega  Veneta  and  Daniel  Lee announced  their  joint  decision  to  end  their  collaboration. Daniel Lee had been at the creative helm of the House since July 1, 2018. He brought new energy to the House and greatly contributed  to  the  new  momentum  that  Bottega  Veneta  is enjoying today.\n\n- 68\n\nOn  November  15,  2021,  Bottega  Veneta  announced  the appointment  of  Matthieu  Blazy  as  Creative  Director.  Born  in Paris  in  1984,  Matthieu  Blazy  is  a  graduate  of  La  Cambre  in Brussels.  He  started  his  fashion  career  as  Men's  Designer  for Raf  Simons,  before  joining  Maison  Martin  Margiela  to  design the  Artisanal  line  and  Women's  ready-to-wear  (RTW)  shows. In 2014, he became Senior Designer at C\u00e9line, before working again with Raf Simons at Calvin Klein from 2016 to 2019. He was appointed RTW Design Director at Bottega Veneta in 2020.

In the first half of the year, the impact was particularly significant (4.4 points), since the euro appreciated on average against the world's other major currencies, particularly the US dollar and the Japanese yen. In the second half, the trend reversed, and the weakening euro led to reported growth 1.4 points higher than growth at constant exchange rates.\n\nReported  growth  with  respect  to  2019  also  reflects  the  fact that  the  euro  was  stronger  on  average  over  the  period  as  a whole (despite more recent movements), and reported growth was approximately 2.5 points lower than growth at constant exchange rates.\n\n## Revenue\n\nTotal  revenue  generated by the Group's Luxury Houses came to  \u20ac17,019  million  in  2021,  much  higher  than  in  2020  (up 34.9% at comparable scope and exchange rates and up 34.3% as reported). Comparisons with 2019 are even more remarkable, with revenue 13.1% higher at constant exchange rates.\n\nAll Houses saw a very strong rebound in sales relative to 2020. Compared to 2019, revenue was higher in the vast majority of the  Group's  businesses,  despite  the  major  reorganization  of the  distribution  network,  which  adversely  affected  wholesale sales.\n\nRelative  to  2020,  after  a  very  solid  first  quarter  (revenue  up 26.0%),  sales  growth  was  exceptional  in  the  second  quarter (up  92.5%  on  a  comparable  basis),  since  2020  performance was  considerably  affected  by  strict  lockdowns  introduced  in\n\nthe  Group's  main  markets.  Growth  was  robust  in  the  third quarter  (up  11.8%)  and  particularly  strong  in  the  fourth (up  32.5%).  In  absolute  terms,  sales  in  the  fourth  quarter of 2021 hit a new all-time high.\n\nRevenue  growth  compared  to  2019  was  positive  in  the  first quarter  of  2021  (up  4.9%),  accelerated  in  the  second (up  10.5%)  and  then  stabilized  in  the  third  (up  9.2%),  before accelerating sharply again in the fourth quarter (up 25.8%).\n\n## Revenue by distribution channel\n\nIn  2021,  sales  in  directly  operated  stores,  including  online sales via Houses' websites and concessions, totaled \u20ac13,782  million,  up  39.5%  on  a  comparable  basis  relative to  2020  and  up  17.7%  versus  2019.  The  previous  comments regarding  quarterly  performance  also  apply  to  the  growth trajectory of revenue generated directly by Kering's brands.\n\nAlthough in-store sales suffered from store closures resulting from COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns, footfall recovered overall throughout the year and ended up higher than in 2020. E-commerce  continued  to  do  well:  revenue  advanced  54.9% on  a  comparable  basis  versus  2020  and  revenues  were  over 2.5 times higher than in 2019. E-commerce directly operated by the Group represented around 15% of the retail channel's revenue on average, reaching 26% in Western Europe and 23% in  North  America.  E-commerce  penetration  was  5%  in  Japan and  7%  in  Asia-Pacific,  and  so  the  potential  for  growth  in those markets is particularly significant.\n\nAs  a  result  of  these  trends,  revenue  from  stores  and e-commerce  sites  directly  operated  by  the  Group  accounted for around 81% of total sales in 2021 compared to 78% in the previous  two  years.  This  increase  stems  partly  from  the long-term strategy implemented by all brands, which is aimed at  controlling  their  distribution  more  effectively,  including online,  and  making  them  more  exclusive  while  prudently managing  the  expansion  of  the  directly  operated  store network and related investments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWholesale  sales  rose  16.8%  in  2021  on  a  comparable  basis versus  2020.  This  was  driven  by  the  rebound  seen  in  the second quarter, whereas growth slowed to 4.4% in the fourth quarter. These figures only partly reflect the reorganization of the wholesale distribution network that is currently underway, through  which  the  Group  is  focusing  more  on  using  the highest-quality  distributors.  Compared  to  2019,  wholesale sales  were  3.0%  lower  at  constant  exchange  rates.  The decrease relative  to  2019  was  a  steep  39.4%  at  Gucci,  which was  the  Group's  first  brand  to  embark  on  the  process  of radically  streamlining  its  distribution  network.  Yves  Saint Laurent  also  voluntarily  limited  its  sales  to  key  distributors, and  saw  its  revenue  with  wholesalers  rise  by  only  6.5% compared to 2019. Boosted by its new creative direction and the  expansion  of  its  ready-to-wear  and  shoes  categories, Bottega  Veneta  won  significant  market  share  with  its wholesalers and recorded a strong increase in wholesale sales.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nAs during the whole of 2020, revenue trends by region varied widely in 2021 due to developments in the pandemic, which affected some regions for longer than others, and because of macroeconomic trends and a lack of tourism.\n\nRevenue (1) in  mature  markets  increased  34.9%  overall  on  a comparable basis versus 2020, and was up 4.4% on 2019.\n\nSales in Western Europe rose 7.6% relative to 2020. Compared to 2019, sales in Western Europe retreated 23.8%, due to weak sales  to  non-European  customers.  In  addition,  because  of lockdowns, over half of the Group's store network in Western Europe on average was closed in the first quarter of 2021, and 26% in the second quarter. However, sales to local customers grew at a very rapid pace and accelerated throughout the year. This  enabled  the  Houses  to  deliver  a  24.3%  year-on-year increase in sales in the fourth quarter, considerably narrowing the gap compared to 2019 (down 11.9%).\n\nIn  Japan,  revenue  rose  21.3%  at  constant  exchange  rates compared  to  2020,  but  relative  to  2019  sales  were  still adversely affected by the pandemic, very moderate economic growth and a lack of Chinese tourists. However, after a third quarter in which footfall was low because of rising COVID-19 case  numbers  and  the  Olympic  Games,  growth  accelerated sharply  in  the  fourth  (up  33.3%),  taking  revenue  above  its fourth quarter 2019 level (up 16.2% at constant exchange rates).\n\nIn  North  America,  the  Group's  Luxury  Houses  continued  the very  strong  growth  recorded  post-lockdown  in  2020  when stores  were  able  to  re-open,  and  revenue  rose  76.8% year-on-year  in  2021.  The  Houses'  sales  were  even  62.1% higher than in 2019. As described in the introductory section above, the consumer environment was particularly dynamic in North  America,  which  drove  growth  for  all  of  the  Houses' distribution  channels.  E-commerce  was  the  star  performer, with  sales  tripling  compared  to  2019.  All  product  categories and price segments were boosted by North America's consumer recovery, which continued unabated in the fourth quarter.\n\nTotal  revenue  in  emerging  markets  rose  34.9%  versus  2020 and 26.0% relative to 2019. As a result, the Group's revenue is becoming increasingly balanced between mature and emerging markets, with emerging markets now making up around 45% of total sales.\n\nIn the Asia Pacific region - which accounts for the majority of the Group's sales in emerging markets - revenue growth was 33.0%  compared  to  2020  and  26.2%  versus  2019.  All  major markets  in  the  region  saw  strong  year-on-year  sales  growth except  in  Oceania,  where  sales  were  badly  affected  by measures  implemented  to  combat  the  pandemic.  The comparison  with  2019  shows  a  more  mixed  picture  as customers  in  Mainland  China  repatriated  some  of  their purchases  to  the  detriment  of  other  markets.  Consequently, in  2021  sales  generated  in  Mainland  China  almost  doubled versus 2019. Again compared to 2019, growth in South Korea -  one  of  the  world's  largest  markets  for  luxury  goods  -  was very solid, with excellent domestic sales more than offsetting the decrease in Chinese customers.\n\nIn other emerging-market countries (mainly in Latin America, the  Middle  East,  Eastern  Europe  and  Russia),  the  Houses posted excellent performance compared to both 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nAll  of  the  main  product  categories  registered  sharp  revenue rises  compared  to  2020.  This  rebound  also  propelled  each category  to  higher  sales  levels  than  in  2019  in  directly operated stores and online.\n\nThe  quality  of  the  Group's  brand  portfolio  and  the  effective strategies  put  in  place  by  the  Houses  resulted  in  relatively even growth across the different product categories.\n\nLeather goods - probably one of the categories most exposed to fluctuations in tourism - posted weaker sales growth than the  other  categories.  However,  this  performance  should  be analyzed  in  the  view  of  the  very  high  base  for  comparison in 2019, as well as the Houses' prudent inventory management in 2020, which led them to limit the number of product lines and amount of stock available in stores in 2020 and for part of 2021.\n\nThanks to the appeal of the Houses' offerings, the ready-to-wear and  shoes  categories  felt  the  full  benefit  of  the  rebound  in luxury spending that began in the second half of 2020 as well as  the  concentration  of  sales  within  domestic  markets  and clientele.\n\nJewelry saw one of the highest year-on-year revenue increases in  2021,  compared  to  both  2020  and  2019.  This  strong momentum was experienced not only by the Group's Jewelry Houses but  also  by  the  jewelry  offerings  of  the  Couture  and Leather  Goods  Houses.  Sales  of  high  jewelry  pieces  also rebounded in 2021. Overall, jewelry sales were mainly driven by demand in Asia but also rose sharply once again in Western Europe  and  the  Middle  East,  although  they  have  not  yet returned to their 2019 levels.\n\nLike  the  rest  of  the  watch-making  industry,  Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin were very heavily affected by the impact of the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2020.  Logically,  therefore,  they recorded very strong sales growth in 2021, although sales still came in below 2019 figures.\n\nRoyalties  and  other  revenues  rose  sharply  in  2021,  led  by excellent  performance  from  the  licenses  managed  by  Kering Eyewear. Royalties from the eyewear category outstripped the figure  recorded  for  2019,  but  those  from  fragrances  and cosmetics licenses were not sufficient to offset the contraction recorded in 2020, despite a solid rebound in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Recurring operating income\n\nRecurring  operating  income  for  the  Group's  Luxury  Houses totaled \u20ac5,175 million in 2021, up \u20ac1,808 million on 2020 and up \u20ac133 million relative to 2019.\n\nRecurring  operating  margin  rose  back  above  the  30% threshold, coming in up 3.8 points year-on-year at 30.4%. This increase naturally stems from a favorable operational leverage effect  due  to  revenue  growth  during  the  period,  but  it  also reflects carefully controlled operating expenses. Nevertheless, all  brands  -  especially  Gucci  -  continued  to  make  the necessary  investments  during  the  period  to  support  their development. In particular, they increased their store-related spending as well as their marketing, communications and IT expenditure,  and  they  strengthened  both  their  central  and regional teams.\n\nProfitability also improved between the first and second halves of the year, with recurring operating margin rising 1.1 points, similar to the improvement seen between the two halves in 2019.\n\nThe  combined  effect  of  exchange  rate  fluctuations  and currency  hedges  was  slightly  negative  in  terms  of  recurring operating  margin  compared  to  2020.  However,  it  was marginally positive relative to 2019.\n\nEBITDA for 2021 amounted to \u20ac6,409 million versus \u20ac4,605 million in  2020  and  \u20ac6,122  million  in  2019.  EBITDA  margin  was historically high at 37.7% in 2021.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nThe  Luxury  Houses'  operating  investments  -  which  do  not include  the  vast  majority  of  investments  in  logistics  and information systems centralized by the Corporate entity for the Houses' benefit - totaled \u20ac643 million in 2021, up \u20ac182 million or  39.5%  compared  to  2020  and  almost  the  same  as  in  2019 (\u20ac652  million).  Operating  investments  represented  3.8%  of revenue in 2021 compared to 4.2% in 2019 (3.6% in 2020).\n\nSome projects were postponed in 2021, with construction and renovation  programs  having  to  be  put  on  hold  in  some markets in the first quarter due to COVID-19 restrictions, and the Houses also decided to focus on the highest-priority and most  strategic  projects.  As  expected,  therefore,  there  was  a very marked difference in operating investments between the first and second halves of 2021, with a large majority (almost two thirds) incurred in the second half.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Group's  Luxury  Houses  had  a network of 1,565 directly operated stores, including 815 (52%) in  mature  markets  and  750  in  emerging  markets.  Net  store additions compared to December 31, 2020 totaled 132. A large majority (almost 60%) of the new store openings were in the Asia-Pacific  region,  but  some  brands  also  expanded  their distribution  networks  with  openings  in  Japan,  North  America and Western Europe. The year-on-year increase was also driven to a very large extent by the scheduled expansion of the Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen networks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The House's  sales  rose  above  their  2019  level  in  absolute  terms. Growth versus 2019 was 3.4% on a comparable basis, with a marked acceleration in the fourth quarter (growth of 17.8%).\n\nHowever,  in  view  of  the  current  reorganization  of  Gucci's distribution network,  which  has  massively  reduced  its wholesale  activity,  retail  sales  in  directly  operated  stores probably constitute the metric that gives the most meaningful measurement of the House's intrinsic performance.\n\n## Revenue by distribution channel\n\nAlthough still partially affected by store closures arising from COVID-19 restrictions in the first half and to a lesser extent the third  quarter  of  2021,  Gucci's  in-store  and  online  revenue advanced 36.7% versus 2020. Compared to 2019 - which was a record year following on from the brand's very strong growth since  2016  -  the  increase  was  10.4%.  Altogether,  therefore, over  the  past  five  years,  Gucci's  retail  sales  have  grown  by around 20% per year on average and in 2021 they accounted for 91% of the brand's revenue.\n\nAs regards directly operated store revenue, growth recorded in recent  years  has  been  almost  exclusively  on  a  same-store basis.  In  addition,  while  store  footfall  considerably  increased throughout  the  year,  it  remained  lower  than  2019  levels. However,  the  main  performance  indicators  in  the  retail business  showed  a  very  sharp  improvement.  The  House's e-commerce  activity  saw  exceptional  development  in  2021 and it accounted for almost 16% of total retail revenue during the  year.  Online  sales  growth  was  therefore  once  again  very buoyant,  up  55.1%  relative  to  2020  and  163.0%  compared to 2019.\n\nSales  generated  in  the  wholesale  network  fell  10.0%  on  a comparable  basis  relative  to  2020.  They  were  down  39.4% compared  to  2019.  This  contraction  is  due  to  the  strategy implemented  in  early  2020  to  transform  Gucci's  distribution network  with  a  view  to  making  it  more  exclusive.  However, wholesale revenue should stabilize in 2022.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nIn view of the proportion of Gucci's sales generated by directly operated stores, the following revenue analysis by region only concerns retail and online sales.\n\nIn mature markets, year-on-year revenue growth was 41.5% at comparable  exchange  rates,  although  trends  varied  between regions.  2021  sales  were  higher  than  2019  levels  on  a comparable basis.\n\nRevenue  in  Western  Europe  rose  16.9%  year-on-year,  due  in particular to very strong business levels in the last few months of the year. Compared to 2019, sales remained lower because of weak tourist numbers and a long period of store closures in the region's main markets at the start of 2021. However, the House's investments aimed at increasing market share in the main European markets paid off in 2021, with a gradual but continuous  increase  in  sales  to  local  customers.  Gucci  is playing the long game in Western Europe, and so is keeping its existing network of stores in that region pending the return of tourism.\n\nIn  Japan,  sales  started  rising  again  in  2021,  with  growth  of 19.0%,  although  revenue  remained  below  its  2019  level. Consumer  trends  in  this  market  improved  in  the  fourth quarter but the drop in tourist numbers remained a drag on business,  although  the  impact  was  less  than  in  Western Europe  as  local  customers  made  up  the  vast  majority  of revenue generated in Japan in 2019.\n\nIn  North  America,  revenue  rebounded  very  strongly,  with  the House's retail sales surging almost 67% at constant exchange rates  relative  to  both  2020  and  2019.  This  performance  was achieved  due  to  the  factors  explained  in  the  introductory section  of  this  Activity  Report,  as  well  as  the  fact  that  Gucci has a wide offering that meets customers' needs in all product categories  and  price  segments,  which  enables  it  to  meet  all types  of  demand  in  the  U.S.  The  House  also  has  untapped growth potential in the region because its store network has been  relatively  unchanged  in  recent  years  and  could  be expanded in certain cities that are establishing themselves as promising new markets for the industry.\n\nIn  emerging  markets  -  which  contributed  just  over  half  of Gucci's  sales  in  2021  -  revenue  rose  by  32.5%  at  constant exchange rates year-on-year and by 20.0% versus 2019.",

        "page_content": "Growth in the Asia-Pacific region was 29.5% year-on-year and has  remained  extremely  strong  since  spring  2020,  when  the region's  strict  lockdowns  began  easing.  Regional  growth  was mainly driven by Mainland China, which saw firm increases in both  online  and  in-store  sales.  Those  trends  are  being supported  by  rising  Chinese  demand  and  by  Chinese customers  purchasing  luxury  products  in  their  domestic market rather than abroad. In this  respect,  it  is  notable  that growth  in  Chinese  e-commerce  sales  are  not  having  any significant  adverse  impact  on  in-store  sales.  Still  in  China, revenue picked up strongly in Macao and Hong Kong, although sales  remained  lower  than  in  2019.  South  Korea  was  once again  a  very  dynamic  market  for  Gucci  due  to  the  brand's popularity  among  local  customers  and  despite  the  poor performance  of  the  Duty-Free  channel,  which  the  brand includes in its network of directly operated stores and whose sales suffered from the lack of Chinese tourists. Sales in South Korea rose above 2019 levels in 2021. With the exception of Australia,  which  was  hit  by  strict  lockdown  measures,  the brand's  other  markets  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region  posted  very robust year-on-year growth, although compared to 2019 they remained  affected  on  the  whole  by  the  fall  in  purchases  by Chinese tourists.\n\nIn the other regions of the world where Gucci operates, sales growth  was  very  firm  compared  to  2020,  and  also  2019  for most markets.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nIn  2021,  all  Gucci's  main  product  categories  registered  very robust  increases  in  sales  from  directly  operated  stores compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  average  selling  prices, resulting  both  from  changes  in  the  product  mix  and  price hikes, made a significant contribution to that growth.\n\nIn the year it celebrated its 100 th anniversary, Gucci continued to  make  subtle  adjustments  to  its  creative  proposition,  its esthetics  and  its  product  range,  in  order  to  meet  the expectations of all customer profiles. With its Aria collection, the House has been able to leverage its unique heritage while remaining resolutely contemporary and modern. The brand's creative and merchandising teams work ceaselessly to achieve this balance, with an ongoing focus on maximizing the growth potential  of  each  product  category  by  constantly  honing  the overall  offering  to  engage  with  the  widest  possible  range  of clients,  and  optimizing  the  mix  between  carryovers  and  new products. Sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 owed a lot to successful product launches and the regular introduction of new spins on iconic pieces, which also formed the basis of communication campaigns and in-store events.\n\nSales of leather goods were impacted for part of the year by the  brand's  prudent  policy  regarding  the  number  of  product lines  available  in  stores  in  2020.  Over  the  year  as  a  whole, however,  leather  goods  revenue  rebounded  strongly  relative to 2020, with a sharp acceleration in the fourth quarter. It was also higher than in 2019 in almost all major markets, although Western  Europe  remained  affected  by  store  closures  at  the start of the year and low tourist numbers.\n\nThe brand's other product categories - which are less sensitive to fluctuations in tourist flows and are driven by e-commerce - saw very robust sales growth compared to 2019.\n\nRoyalties  were  up  sharply  on  2020.  In  the  eyewear  category, royalties  from  the  licenses  managed  by  Kering  Eyewear exceeded  the  2019  figure,  but  royalties  from  the  license granted to Coty for fragrances and cosmetics were still down on 2019.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nGucci's  recurring  operating  income  amounted  to  \u20ac3,715  million for 2021, up 42.1% on 2020.\n\nRecurring operating margin rose by 3.1 points to 38.2%.\n\nThe improvement  in recurring operating margin was attributable  to  a  positive  leverage  effect  driven  by  sales growth.  However,  during  Gucci's  centenary  year,  the  brand continued to make the investments required to fully capitalize on  the  luxury  industry's  rebound,  by  allocating  resources  to clienteling activities, in-store events, communication campaigns and upgrades to digital platforms and information systems.  Given  this  targeted  increase  in  its  cost  base, particularly  in  the  second  half  of  the  year,  Gucci's  recurring operating margin rose 0.7 points between the first and second halves of 2021.\n\nGucci's EBITDA for 2021 stood at \u20ac4,311 million, an increase of \u20ac1,086  million  relative  to  2020  and  representing  an  EBITDA margin of 44.3%.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Gucci operated 501 stores directly, including 226 in emerging markets. A net 18 new stores were opened  during  the  year,  mainly  in  Asia.  Gucci's  focus  is  on achieving  organic  growth  by  maximizing  the  productivity  of the existing store network, but it is also continuing to identify opportunities that will enable it to enhance its distribution in certain regions or sales channels.\n\nGucci's  operating  investments  amounted  to  \u20ac324  million in  2021,  57.3%  higher  than  in  2020  but  almost  unchanged relative to 2019. Operating investments were split fairly evenly between refurbishments, openings and relocations on the one hand,  and  projects  related  to  the  supply  chain,  digital  and support functions on the other.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Compared  to  2019,  growth accelerated throughout the year, rising from 6.6% in the first quarter to 46.7% in the fourth.\n\nIt was another year of strong growth for the House, which has achieved average sales growth of around 22% per year in the last  10  years,  despite  a  limited  decrease  in  revenue  in  2020. This  means  that  the  House's  sales  have  been  multiplied  by seven since 2011.\n\n## Revenue by distribution channel\n\nRevenue  from  directly  operated  stores,  which  accounted  for 74% of the total, jumped 55.3% relative to 2020, driven mainly by  same-store  growth.  Revenue  was  35.0%  higher  than in 2019. Growth was the result of a material recovery in store footfall  relative  to  2020,  although  it  varied  from  region  to region, as well as a marked improvement in the various retail performance indicators and continued growth in online sales. The House's online business posted growth of 81.7% relative to 2020, despite a high base for comparison, and online sales tripled their 2019 level.\n\nSales generated in the wholesale network were 22.9% higher than in  2020.  Compared to  2019,  however,  their  growth  was more  modest  at  6.5%  on  a  comparable  basis.  Although  the wholesale  channel  remains  strategically  important  for  Yves Saint Laurent, as it perfectly complements its retail business, the  brand  is  continuing  to  pay  particular  attention  to  the quality and exclusivity of its distribution and is being careful to  focus  its  wholesale  business  on  a  limited  number  of distributors.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nIn  view  of  the  proportion  of  Yves  Saint  Laurent's  sales generated  by  directly  operated  stores,  the  following  revenue analysis by region only concerns retail and online sales.\n\nYves  Saint  Laurent  notched  up  strong  year-on-year  revenue growth across all major regions in 2021. However, in line with the  situation  in  the  luxury  industry  as  a  whole,  Yves  Saint Laurent's performance  was  mixed  across  its  different geographic regions.\n\nSales in the brand's heritage markets picked up, with growth of 65.7% relative to 2020 and 30.3% compared to 2019.\n\nThe  brand's  popularity  with  local  customers  and  a  further increase in store footfall throughout the year drove year-on-year revenue  growth  of  38.4%  in  Western  Europe  and  17.6%  in Japan.\n\nHowever,  although  Yves  Saint  Laurent  is  less  exposed  to tourism than other Houses, low tourist numbers remained a drag  on  both  regions'  sales  compared  to  2019.  Revenue  in those markets remained a little lower than 2019 levels, except in  the  fourth  quarter  when  sales  to  European  and  Japanese customers accelerated sharply.\n\nIn North America, the House's penetration in the United States, the upturn in store footfall and buoyant online sales drove an exceptional  performance  over  the  period,  with  revenue  up 109.6% on 2020 and 104.5% on 2019.\n\nIn  emerging  markets,  sales  generated  in  directly  operated stores rose 41.5% compared to 2020 and 43.2% relative to 2019.",

        "page_content": "In the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for the bulk of the brand's  revenue  in  emerging  markets,  sales  were  up  36.0% versus 2020 and 38.5% relative to 2019. China is still the main growth driver in the region, and the brand's sales in Mainland China  doubled  relative  to  2019.  Sales  in  the  region's  other major  countries  increased  sharply  year-on-year.  Compared to 2019 levels, growth was strongest in South Korea which, in its role as trendsetter, is a key market for the House.\n\nYves  Saint  Laurent's  performance  in  the  Middle  East,  which has historically been an important market for the brand, was also outstanding.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nAll product categories registered sharp revenue rises compared  to  2020  and  exceeded  2019  levels  in  the  brand's directly operated stores and online channel.\n\nLeather goods remained the brand's top category, with sales growth compared to both 2020 and 2019 closely aligned with the  House's  overall  performance.  This  reflects  the  initiatives taken  by  Yves  Saint  Laurent  over  the  last  few  years  to constantly renew and refresh its leather goods offering with a specially dedicated creative team, which has helped it to both attract  new  customers  and  retain  existing  ones  in  all  its markets.\n\nSales  of  ready-to-wear  for  both  women  and  men  rose  very sharply,  and  growth  accelerated  throughout  the  year.  This performance  is  the  result  of  the  brand's  merchandising strategy implemented over the past quarters with the aim of making  its  offerings  and  price  architecture  more  relevant  in this category.\n\nRevenue from the shoes category also bounced back and rose above  its  2019  level,  propelled  primarily  by  the  success  of collections for women.\n\nRoyalties  from  the  eyewear  category  were  up  on  2019  and even  more  so  on  2020  thanks  to  sustained  efforts  from  the teams at Kering Eyewear. Royalties from L'Or\u00e9al rose sharply year-on-year and were almost unchanged compared to 2019.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nYves  Saint  Laurent  generated  record  recurring  operating income of \u20ac715 million in 2021, an increase of 78.7% on 2020.\n\nRecurring operating margin also hit an all-time high at 28.3%, up 5.4 points relative to 2020 and up 0.9 points versus 2019.\n\nThis further improvement is in line with the brand's goals and the  growth  trajectory  it  had  set  itself  prior  to  the  COVID-19 crisis.  It  also  demonstrates  that  Yves  Saint  Laurent  has achieved critical size, enabling it to capitalize on its operating leverage while also allocating all  the  resources  necessary  for its short-  and  medium-term  development,  ranging  from creating,  expanding and running its store network to leading communication campaigns around the brand.\n\nEBITDA rose by \u20ac325 million to \u20ac915 million. EBITDA margin was  36.3%,  versus  33.8%  as  reported  in  2020  and  35.8% in 2019.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Yves Saint Laurent had 268 directly operated stores, including nearly half (128) in emerging markets. There were 29 net store openings during 2021, reflecting the brand's  store  network  expansion  plan  implemented  over  the past  few  years  and  taking  into  account  the  restrictions  on construction  work  and  store  openings  caused  by  lockdown measures  in  certain  regions,  particularly  at  the  start  of  the year.  Nearly  all  the  openings  were  in  Asia  or  North  America, regions  where  business  growth  is  very  strong  and  where  the brand's distribution network does not yet match its potential.\n\nThe House's operating investments amounted to \u20ac72 million, up  \u20ac19  million  relative  to  2020  but  lower  than  the  figure for 2019, when Yves Saint Laurent implemented a large-scale investment program around store openings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Bottega Veneta had been particularly resilient in 2020, as one of the industry's few brands to post revenue growth that year. Compared  to  2019,  sales  rose  31.8%  at  constant  exchange rates in 2021. This performance  reflects  the  House's successful  implementation  of  its  strategy,  which  aims  to develop its offerings in all product categories, rejuvenate and broaden its customer base, raise brand awareness - especially in mature  markets  -  and  enhance  customers'  in-store experience.\n\n## Revenue by distribution channel\n\nIn  line  with  its  exclusive,  high-end  market  position,  Bottega Veneta's preferred distribution channel consists of its directly operated  stores.  However,  for  almost  two  years,  the  brand's growing appeal among wholesale buyers has enabled Bottega Veneta to regain market share with its wholesalers. As a result, the  contribution  of  directly  operated  stores  was  stable  at around 75% of the brand's total sales in 2021.\n\nThe  House's  sales  in  directly  operated  stores,  including e-commerce,  advanced  by  28.5%  versus  2020  and  by  22.3% versus  2019.  This  growth  was  driven  by  healthy,  controlled development  in  terms  of  both  store  sales  (on  a  same-store basis)  and  online  sales.  The  e-commerce  business  was boosted by the move to bring in-house operations that were previously  managed  under  a  joint  venture  with  Yoox.  Online sales were four times their 2019 level.\n\nWholesale  sales  were  up  15.7%  compared  to  2020  and  up 72.9%  relative  to  2019,  testifying  to  the  brand's  renewed appeal  with  professional  buyers.  This  excellent  performance came against the background of actions taken to reorganize the  wholesale  channel,  with  a  view  to  only  working  with  a limited number of best-in-class partners. As a result of those actions,  growth  in  wholesale  sales  slowed  in  the  fourth quarter  (relative  to  2019)  and  is  likely  to  further  normalize in 2022.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nGiven  the  proportion  of  Bottega  Veneta's  sales  that  are generated  in  directly  operated  stores,  the  following  revenue analysis by region only concerns retail and online sales.\n\nTrends  that  emerged  in  2020  were  confirmed  in  2021:  in Western Europe and North America - where local customers were  the  first  to  be  won  over  by  the  House's  new  creative direction - sales were very strong throughout the year. Bottega Veneta's desirability also continued to increase in Asia.\n\nIn  emerging  markets,  the  brand's  sales  advanced  23.9% year-on-year on a comparable basis versus 2020 and by over 40%  compared  to  2019.  In  particular,  growth  was  extremely strong  in  Mainland  China  and  South  Korea,  its  two  main markets in the Asia-Pacific region, where the brand has more than doubled in size in two years.\n\nIn  mature  markets,  the  House's  revenue  rose  above  2019 levels, increasing by 34.0% year-on-year.",

        "page_content": "In  North  America,  Bottega  Veneta  recorded  strong  sales growth  compared  to  2020  (up  83.3%)  and  2019  (up  67.0%). This is an outstanding performance given the House's market position  and  its  offering,  which  is  generally  less  aspirational than that of other Group brands.\n\nIn  Japan,  sales  rebounded by 31.6% compared to 2020, taking them back to their 2019 level. Developments in Japanese sales throughout  the  year  seem  to  show  that  the  House's  new aesthetic  direction  and  broader  product  range  are  making  it increasingly popular with local customers.\n\nIn  Western  Europe,  revenue  from  local  clients  continued  to increase  significantly,  but  performance  in  this  market  (sales growth  of  7.0%  year-on-year)  reflects  a  high  base  of comparison, since the House was one of the most resilient in the region in 2020.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nAll  of  the  brand's  main  product  categories  registered  higher sales than in 2020 and 2019.\n\nLeather  goods  once  again  constituted  the  brand's  core business,  making  up  71%  of  total  sales,  including  wholesale. New  lines  met  with  great  success  among  the  House's customer  base,  while  lines  launched  in  previous  years  are clearly  now  established  as  carryovers.  The  House's  strategy aims  to  maintain  the  exclusivity  associated  with  this  key category  of  leather  goods,  particularly  by  focusing  on  sales growth  through  higher  prices  and  an  improved  product  mix rather than volume growth alone.\n\nSales in other categories grew sharply, buoyed by the success of the Women's ready-to-wear and shoes collections as well as Men's collections following on from 2020, when actions taken to re-energize these collections started to pay off.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nBottega Veneta's recurring operating income for 2021 totaled \u20ac286 million, up 66.6% compared to 2020 and up \u20ac71 million relative to the reported figure for 2019.\n\nRecurring  operating  margin  came  to  19.1%,  up  4.9  points year-on-year and up 0.7 points relative to 2019. That increase was driven by positive operational leverage, even though the House invested heavily in 2021 to make its revamp a lasting success. The increase in the cost base is therefore being well managed and priorities are being set regarding the allocation of  resources  to  focus  them  on  the  most  effective  types  of expenditure. The brand's profitability is expected to continue improving gradually.\n\nEBITDA  amounted  to  \u20ac449  million,  and  EBITDA  margin  rose 2.3 points, taking it close to 30%.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  Bottega  Veneta  had  263  directly operated  stores,  including  125  in  emerging  markets.  There were two net store openings during the year. As in 2020, the brand  focused  its  investment  efforts  on  relocating  and refurbishing  its  existing  stores,  while  pursuing  its  strategy  of gradual and targeted openings as opportunities arose, notably with the establishment of new flagships.\n\nOperating  investments  totaled  \u20ac67  million  in  2021,  higher than in both 2020 and 2019 but broadly stable as a proportion of the House's sales (4 to 5%).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This excellent momentum put the Other Houses firmly back on the growth trajectory, more than offsetting the drop in revenue seen in 2020. Compared to 2019, sales rose 30.6%.\n\nThese figures were not affected by changes in scope. Although it was announced that the watches brands would be sold in the first half of 2022, they remained fully consolidated in 2021.\n\nBalenciaga and Alexander McQueen - two of the few brands in the  luxury  industry  to  achieve  sales  growth  in  2020  -  once again  delivered  excellent  performances,  particularly  when compared against 2019.\n\nQeelin  benefited  fully  from  Mainland  China's  strong  luxury market, although sales in the second half were partly affected by  more  moderate  store  footfall  resulting  from  measures introduced  to  combat  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Qeelin  is becoming a leading jewelry brand in China.\n\nBoucheron's  performance  was  exceptional  in  2021,  even though a large proportion of its sales has traditionally come from Western Europe and major customers, who traveled less in 2021 than in previous years. Its revenue in 2021 was much higher  than  in  2019,  and  the  brand  confirmed  its  extremely promising development in Asia.\n\nSales  generated  by  Pomellato  -  which  is  still  mainly distributed in Europe - increased compared to 2020 and even exceeded  their  2019  level.  The  House  celebrated  the 20 th anniversary  of  its  Nudo  collection,  and  also  successfully developed a high jewelry range.\n\nBrioni continued  to  implement  its  transformation  and reorganization  plan  and  saw  an  encouraging  rebound  in revenue relative to 2020, although sales remained lower than in 2019.\n\nGirard  Perregaux  and  Ulysse  Nardin  benefited  from  the recovery  in  the  watch  industry  and  saw  very  strong  sales growth relative to 2020. However, the reorganization of their distribution  operation,  resulting  in  a  smaller  number  of retailers, meant that sales remained below 2019 levels.\n\n## Revenue by distribution channel\n\nRevenue  from  stores  and  e-commerce  activities  directly operated  by  the  Other  Houses  rose  46.2%  year-on-year  and 39.7% versus 2019. The increase compared to 2019 was partly the result of new store openings carried out in line with the strategy of moving towards more exclusive distribution, but it was also propelled by rapid growth in online sales, mainly for Couture and Leather Goods brands.\n\nWholesale  sales  rose  39.5%  year-on-year  in  2021.  Compared to  2019,  they  were  up  21.4%.  This  growth  reflects  the measures taken by the Other Houses - primarily Balenciaga to  focus  their  wholesale  activity  on  a  select  number  of top-quality  partners,  and  these  efforts  to  achieve  greater exclusivity are set to ramp up in 2022.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nThe  performances  by  region  delivered  by  the  Other  Houses followed  similar  trends  to  those  seen  at  Gucci,  Yves  Saint Laurent  and  Bottega  Veneta.  Sales  were  up  on  2020  in  all regions,  but  did  not  return  to  their  2019  levels  in  Western Europe or Japan.",

        "page_content": "In  mature  markets  as  a  whole,  revenue  advanced  35.5% year-on-year at constant exchange rates and was 14.8% higher than  the  2019  figure.  In  North  America,  growth  was  very robust  compared  with  both  2020  (with  revenue  up  96.0%) and  2019  (up  almost  100%).  Western  Europe  and  Japan  saw their  revenue  rebound  from  2020  levels,  with  increases  of 14.5%  and  24.0%  respectively.  The  decline  in  sales  relative to 2019 was very small, since the Other Houses' performance improved throughout the year in those markets.\n\nIn emerging markets, revenue was up 59.1% versus 2020 and up 67.0% relative to 2019. Greater China and South Korea were the main drivers of this performance. In Mainland China, the Other  Houses  enjoyed  the  full  benefit  of  Chinese  demand shifting  back  to  the  domestic  market,  with  business  also boosted by store openings, heightened brand awareness and the growing appeal of the brands' offerings. The Other Houses have  more  than  tripled  their  sales  in  Mainland  China since 2019.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nIn  2021,  all  product  categories  sold  by  the  Couture  and Leather Goods Houses posted very strong growth compared to both 2020 and 2019. This performance reflects the excellent response to the Houses' collections in those segments during a year in which sales recovered.\n\nIn  particular,  the  leather  goods  offerings  of  Balenciaga  and Alexander  McQueen  expanded  and  attracted  new  customers. As a result, sales in that category grew strongly.\n\nThe ready-to-wear category also delivered rapid sales growth, primarily driven by menswear collections.\n\nShoes  once  again  saw  particularly  strong  growth  in  2021, driven  by  the  appeal  of  the  Balenciaga  and  Alexander McQueen collections.\n\nJewelry  brands  continued  to  implement  their  development plans successfully in 2021, and saw sales rise very substantially compared  to  both  2020  and  2019.  As  a  result,  the  jewelry category,  including  the  offerings  of  Couture  Houses,  posted one of the highest growth rates.\n\nLastly,  after  a  sharp  decrease  in  2020,  the  watches  brands' revenue rebounded in 2021.\n\nRoyalties  increased  relative  to  both  2020  and  2019,  mainly due  to  the  very  strong  performance  of  licenses  managed  by Kering Eyewear.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nThe Other Houses' recurring operating income was \u20ac459 million in 2021, more than double the 2020 figure and 44.7% higher than in 2019. Recurring operating margin came to 14.1%, up 6.2 points on 2020 and up 1.6 points on 2019.\n\nThe  year-on-year  improvement  compared  to  2020  -  which concerned all of the Other Houses - was the natural result of positive  operational  leverage,  and  was  achieved  despite  the additional  expenditure  incurred  by  the  brands  to  fully capitalize  on  growth  trends  currently  driving  the  luxury market.  The  comparison  with  2019  shows  that  most  of  the Other Houses have now reached critical size enabling them to absorb  higher  operating  expenses  while  still  increasing  their recurring operating margin. For the brands that are closer to breakeven or still implementing restructuring or reorganization  plans,  like  Brioni,  profitability  levels  in  2021 remained lower than or similar to those in 2019.\n\nEBITDA increased \u20ac277 million year-on-year to \u20ac734 million. EBITDA margin rose back above the 20% threshold to 22.5%, 0.8 points higher than in 2019.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nThe  Other  Houses  directly  operated  533  stores  as  of December 31, 2021, an increase of 83 year-on-year. This rise was mainly attributable to store openings by Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen in Asia, but also in North America. Another key  development  was  the  expansion  of  the  Jewelry  Houses' store network, with new openings again focused in Asia.\n\nThis  is  making  the  network  more  geographically  balanced, with  262  stores  in  mature  markets  and  271  in  emerging markets as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThese developments naturally led to an increase in the Other Houses'  operating  investments,  which  totaled  \u20ac180  million. That represents an increase of \u20ac26 million relative to 2020, a year in which the Houses maintained their investment efforts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering Eyewear's sales  rose  by  45.0%  (as  reported)  and  by  40.8%  at constant scope and exchange rates relative to 2020. They were 16.9%  higher  than  in  2019  at  constant  scope  and  exchange rates.  The  increase  in  the  number  of  licenses,  with  the addition  of  Chloe  and  Dunhill  in  the  early  part  of  the  year, made  only  a  marginal  contribution  to  this  growth,  which stemmed mainly from Kering Eyewear's excellent management, its agility and its capacity for innovation.\n\nPerformance in the first and second halves of the year must be analyzed in view of seasonal variations in Kering Eyewear's business - with more sales taking place in the first six months and the very low base for comparison in the first part of the year.\n\nExcluding sales to major international distributors and stores operated by the Group's brands, EMEA was once again Kering Eyewear's  main  market,  followed  by  the  Americas.  The proportion  of  revenue  generated  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region (including Japan) again fell slightly in 2021 due to the strong weighting of travel retail in that region. In terms of distribution channels, local chains and the \"three Os\" (opticians, optometrists and ophthalmologists) constitute the main sales channel  for  Kering  Eyewear  (representing  over  50%  of  total sales in both 2021 and 2020). This channel was the one that grew the most in 2021, having shown its resilience by keeping revenue  stable  in  2020,  a  performance  that  testifies  to  the effectiveness of Kering Eyewear's commercial set-up.\n\n- 84\n\nKering Eyewear's contribution to consolidated revenue for  2020  totaled  \u20ac599  million  (after  eliminating  intra-group sales and royalties paid to the Group's brands), representing a 44.9% year-on-year increase at constant scope and exchange rates (up 24.1% compared to 2019).\n\nOn the back of this outstanding sales growth combined with good  cost  control,  and  now  that  the  compensation  paid  to Safilo for the early termination of the Gucci license has been fully  amortized,  recurring  operating  income  has  increased sharply  and  is  largely  contributing  to  the  decrease  in  the \"Corporate and other\" segment's net costs.\n\nOverall,  net  costs  recorded  by  the  'Corporate  and  other' segment came to \u20ac158 million in 2021, \u20ac74 million lower than in 2020 and \u20ac106 million lower than in 2019.\n\nThe  cost  of  long-term  incentive  plans,  including  those  of corporate officers, was \u20ac26 million, \u20ac21 million less than the cost  recognized  in  2020.  Prudent  provisions  have  been recorded for the cost of these plans in recent years, and the gradual substitution of Kering synthetic shares (KMUs) by free shares has had a positive accounting impact to date.\n\nThe  increase  in  head  office  costs  was  very  limited  in  2021 compared  to  2020  and  2019,  and  was  largely  due  to  the ramp-up  of  the  Group's  digital,  innovation  and  information systems initiatives.\n\nOperating investments totaled \u20ac291 million, down \u20ac35 million relative  to  2020,  when  they  reached  an  all-time  high  due  to sustained strategic investments, such as the upgrade of all the Group's  information  systems  and,  above  all,  the  logistics operations managed by the Corporate teams on behalf of the Group's brands. The bulk of the costs relating to the Trecate logistics  platform  in  Northern  Italy,  which  was  officially opened in the first half of 2021, were recorded in 2020. As a result,  the  segment's  operating  investments  returned  to  its 2019 level of around \u20ac300 million.",

Combining  an  innovative  approach  to  design  and  technical know-how,  they  have  revamped  their  product  universes, launched new iconic models and reorganized their distribution, with the opening of directly operated stores and stronger ties with the leading watch distributors.\n\nThe Group has supported the two Houses in their development,  strengthened  their  market  positions  and ensured they have adequate resources to finance their growth. The Group is confident that their existing management will be able to continue their work successfully.\n\nThis transaction is in line with Kering's strategy, giving priority to  Houses  that  have  the  potential  to  become  sizable  assets within the Group and to which it can provide decisive support over time.\n\nIt should be completed by the end of the first half of 2022 (see Consolidated  financial  statements,  Note  8  -  Other  nonrecurring operating income and expenses).\n\n## Events subsequent to the meeting of the Board of Directors which approved the Management Report\n\n## Launch of the second tranche of the stock repurchase program\n\nPursuant  to  the  Stock  Repurchase  Program  announced  on August 25, 2021, covering up to 2.0% of its share capital over a 24-month  period,  Kering  announced  on  February  22,  2022 that  it  has  signed  a  new  share  buyback  agreement  with  an investment service provider. This new agreement is related to the  second  tranche  of  the  program.  This  new  tranche  will\n\ncover a maximum volume of 650,000 shares, i.e. approximately 0.5% of Kering's outstanding share capital as of February 15, 2022.\n\nThe  purchase  period  provided  in  the  agreement  started  on February  23,  2022  and  will  last  until  April  26,  2022  at  the latest.\n\nAs of March 18, 2022, 504,827 shares were bought back.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering's Houses do not operate any stores in Ukraine.\n\nGiven the severity of the situation, Kering and its Houses have lent  their  support  to  humanitarian  efforts  and  to  Ukrainian refugees  by  making  several  donations,  mainly  to  the  UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.\n\nshares is intended to cover free share grant programs to some employees.

Recognized for its outstanding technicity and distinctive Hawaiian heritage that embodies the 'Aloha Spirit', Maui Jim is an authentic brand that offers a broad spectrum of high-quality  sun  and  optical  frames  sold  in  more  than  100 countries.  Anchored  in  its  culture  of  innovation,  Maui  Jim engineered the proprietary and  patented  revolutionary PolarizedPlus2\u00ae lens technology which protects from intense glare and  harmful  UV  while  enhancing  color  naturally perceived by the eye.\n\nSince  its  inception  in  2014,  Kering  Eyewear  has  built  an innovative business model that enabled the company to reach more than \u20ac700m external revenues in FY2021. The acquisition of  Maui  Jim  represents  a  major  milestone  in  the  successful\n\n## 10 OUTLOOK\n\nA  major  player  in  a  fast-growing  market  around  the  world, Kering enjoys solid fundamentals and a balanced portfolio of complementary  brands  with  strong  potential.  Its  strategic priorities are straightforward. The Group and its Houses seek to  achieve  same-store  revenue  growth  while  ensuring  the targeted  and  selective  expansion  of  their  retail  networks. Kering  aims  to  grow  its  Houses  in  a  sustainable  manner, enhance the exclusivity of their distribution and secure their profitable  growth  trajectories.  The  Group  is  also  investing proactively to develop cross-business growth platforms in the areas of e-commerce, omnichannel distribution, logistics and technological  infrastructure,  digital  expertise  and  innovative tools.\n\nThe  2020  public  health  crisis  and  subsequent  economic disruption  have  had  major  consequences  on  consumption trends,  tourism  flows  and  global  economic  growth.  Together with  the  whole  luxury  sector,  the  Group  was  profoundly\n\nexpansion strategy of Kering Eyewear. Only a few months after the acquisition of LINDBERG, Kering Eyewear will own a second proprietary  brand,  reinforce  its  status  on  the  high-end eyewear segment and broaden its offer to cover the full scope from functional to timeless and fashion luxury products.\n\nTheir  complementary  distribution  networks  and  product offerings  will  contribute  to  amplify  the  growth  potential through  the  expansion  of  Maui  Jim's  geographical  footprint and  the  ability  to  gain  new  customers,  more  focused  on innovation  and  functionalities.  Through  this  combination, Kering  Eyewear  reaches  new  levels,  with  revenues  materially ahead of the billion-euro mark on a full-year basis and profit margins further improving.\n\nThe  transaction  is  subject  to  the  clearance  by  the  relevant competition  authorities  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  in the second half of 2022.\n\nimpacted  by  the  effects  of  the  pandemic  in  the  first  six months of 2020. More favorable trends, which emerged in the second half of 2020, were confirmed in 2021. Although these trends  remain  conditioned  by  developments  in  the  health situation  and  associated  restrictions  across  countries,  the luxury  market  witnesses  a  significant  rebound,  driven  by consumer appetite for premium goods.\n\nKering is perfectly positioned to fully benefit from this upturn. The  Group  pursues  the  implementation  of  its  strategy  with determination  and  will  continue  to  manage  and  allocate  its resources to best support its operating performance, continue generating  significant  cash  flow,  and  optimize  its  return  on capital employed.\n\nThanks to its strong business and organizational model, along with  its  robust  financial  position,  Kering  is  confident  in  its growth potential for the medium and long term.\n\n- 90",

The  Group  also  uses  'comparable'  data  to  measure organic growth. 'Comparable' revenue refers to 2020 revenue adjusted as follows by:\n\n- \u00b7 neutralizing  the  portion  of  revenue  corresponding  to entities divested in 2020;\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nThe Group's operating income includes all revenues and expenses directly  related  to  its  activities,  whether  these  revenues  and expenses are recurring or arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.\n\nOther non-recurring operating income and expenses consist of items that, by their nature, amount or frequency, could distort the  assessment  of  the  Group's  operating  performance  as reflected  in  its  recurring  operating  income.  They  include changes  in  Group  structure,  the  impairment  of  goodwill  and brands and, where material, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nThe Group uses EBITDA to monitor its operating performance. This  financial  indicator  corresponds  to  recurring  operating income  plus  net  charges  to  depreciation,  amortization  and\n\n- \u00b7 including the portion of revenue corresponding to entities acquired in 2021;\n- \u00b7 remeasuring 2020 revenue at 2021 exchange rates.\n\nThese adjustments give rise to comparative data at constant scope  and  exchange  rates,  which  serve  to  measure  organic growth.\n\n\"Recurring operating income\" is therefore a major indicator for the Group, defined as the difference between operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can  therefore  be  used  as  a  way  to  estimate  recurring performance. This indicator is presented in a manner that is consistent  and  stable  over  the  long  term  in  order  to  ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information.\n\nprovisions  on  non-current  operating  assets  recognized  in recurring operating income.\n\n## Free cash flow from operations, available cash flow from operations and available cash flow\n\nThe  Group  uses  an  intermediate  line  item,  \"Free  cash  flow from  operations\",  to  monitor  its  financial  performance.  This financial indicator measures net operating cash flow less net operating investments (defined as acquisitions and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).\n\nThe  Group  has  also  defined  a  new  indicator,  'Available  cash flow  from  operations',  in  order  to  take  into  account capitalized fixed lease payments (repayments of principal and interest)  pursuant  to  IFRS  16,  and  thereby  reflect  all  of  its operating cash flows.\n\n\"Available  cash  flow\"  therefore  corresponds  to  available  cash flow from operations plus interest and dividends received, less interest paid and equivalent (excluding leases).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, the cost of net debt corresponds to all financial income and expenses associated with these items, including\n\nthe  impact  of  derivative  instruments  used  to  hedge  the  fair value of borrowings.\n\nBorrowings include put options granted to minority interests.\n\n## Effective tax rate on recurring income\n\nThe  effective  tax  rate  on  recurring  income  corresponds  to  the  effective  tax  rate  excluding  tax  effects  relating  to  other non-recurring operating income and expenses.\n\n## 12 INVESTMENT POLICY\n\nKering's investment policy is designed to support and enhance the Group's growth potential in its markets and is focused on financial  investments  (acquisitions  and  disposals  of  assets) and investments related to operations (organic growth).\n\nFinancial investments reflect the Group's strategy of reinforcing profitable high-growth activities in the luxury market by acquiring\n\n## Financial investments\n\nFinancial  investments  represented  net  cash  outflows  of \u20ac465.8 million for 2021, relating mainly to the acquisition of LINDBERG  (compared  to  \u20ac6.2  million  of  net  cash  inflows for  2020,  mainly  from  consolidating  the  cash  and  cash equivalents of acquired entities).\n\nThe  cash  impact  of  selling  discontinued  businesses  (mainly Volcom  and  Redcats)  restated  in  accordance  with  IFRS  5  is shown in the 'Net cash received from (used in) discontinued operations' item and  represented  a  cash  outflow  of \u20ac2.4 million in 2021 (net cash outflow of \u20ac4.3 million in 2020).\n\n## Operating investments\n\nThe Group conducts a targeted investment policy designed to reinforce  both  its  image  and  the  unique  positioning  of  its brands, as well as to increase its return on capital employed.\n\nThe Group's investment policy is focused on the development of  its  store  network,  the  conversion  and  renovation  of  its existing points of sale, the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing units in the luxury sector, and the development of IT systems.\n\nGross  operating  investments  amounted  to  \u20ac934  million in  2021,  up  18.7%  relative  to  2020  and  almost  the  same  as the  2019  figure  (\u20ac956  million).  For  Luxury  activities,  the \u20ac182 million increase in investments relative to 2020 reflects\n\nthe  continued  focus  on  consolidating  the  existing  store network  and  achieving  organic  growth,  along  with  selective store openings.\n\nInvestments  in  the  \"Corporate  and  other\"  segment  totaled \u20ac291  million,  down  \u20ac35  million  relative  to  2020,  when  they reached an all-time high due to sustained strategic investments, such  as  the  upgrade  of  all  the  Group's  information  systems and, above all, the logistics operations managed by Corporate teams on behalf of the Group's brands. The bulk of the costs relating to the Trecate logistics platform in Northern Italy, which was officially opened in the first half of 2021, were recorded in  2020.  As  a  result,  the  segment's  operating  investments returned to their 2019 level of around \u20ac300 million.\n\nattractive  brands  with  strong  growth  potential  and  market positions that complement its existing assets.\n\nOperating  investments  are  designed  to  accelerate  organic growth  for  the  Group's  brands.

        "page_content": "## Luxury Houses\n\nGross  operating  investments  in  the  Luxury  Houses  segment amounted to \u20ac643 million in 2021, up \u20ac182 million or 39.5% relative  to  2020  and  almost  the  same  as  the  2019  figure (\u20ac652  million).  They  represented  3.8%  of  revenue  in  2021 compared to 4.2% in 2019 (3.6% in 2020).\n\nSome projects were postponed in 2021, with construction and renovation  programs  having  to  be  put  on  hold  in  some markets in the first quarter due to COVID-19 restrictions, and the Houses also decided to focus on the highest-priority and most  strategic  projects.  As  expected,  therefore,  there  was  a very marked difference in operating investments between the first and second halves of 2021, with a large majority (almost two thirds) incurred in the second half.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Group's  Luxury  Houses  had  a network of 1,565 directly operated stores, including 815 (52%) in  mature  markets  and  750  in  emerging  markets.  Net  store additions compared to December 31, 2020 totaled 132. A large majority (almost 60%) of the new store openings were in the Asia-Pacific  region,  but  some  brands  also  expanded  their distribution  networks  with  openings  in  Japan,  North  America and  Western  Europe.  The  year-on-year  increase  was  also driven to a very large extent by the scheduled expansion of the Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen networks.\n\n## Gucci\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Gucci operated 501 stores directly, including 226 in emerging markets. A net 18 new stores were opened  during  the  year,  mainly  in  Asia.  Gucci's  focus  is  on achieving  organic  growth  by  maximizing  the  productivity  of the existing store network, but it is also continuing to identify opportunities that will enable it to enhance its distribution in certain regions or sales channels.\n\nGucci's gross operating investments amounted to \u20ac324 million in  2021,  57.3%  higher  than  in  2020  but  almost  unchanged relative  to  2019.  Those  investments  were  split  fairly  evenly between refurbishments, openings and relocations on the one hand,  and  projects  related  to  the  supply  chain,  digital  and support functions on the other.\n\n## Yves Saint Laurent\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Yves Saint Laurent had 268 directly operated stores, including nearly half (128) in emerging markets. There were 29 net store openings during 2021, reflecting the brand's  store  network  expansion  plan  implemented  over  the past  few  years  and  taking  into  account  the  restrictions  on construction  work  and  store  openings  caused  by  lockdown measures  in  certain  regions,  particularly  at  the  start  of  the year.  Nearly  all  the  openings  were  in  Asia  or  North  America, regions  where  business  growth  is  very  strong  and  where  the brand's distribution network does not yet match its potential.\n\nThe House's operating investments amounted to \u20ac72 million, up  \u20ac19  million  relative  to  2020  but  lower  than  the  figure for 2019, when Yves Saint Laurent implemented a large-scale investment program around store openings.\n\n## Bottega Veneta\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  Bottega  Veneta  had  263  directly operated  stores,  including  125  in  emerging  markets.  There were two net store openings during the year. As in 2020, the brand  focused  its  investment  efforts  on  relocating  and refurbishing  its  existing  stores,  while  pursuing  its  strategy  of gradual and targeted openings as opportunities arose, notably with the establishment of new flagships.\n\nOperating investments totaled \u20ac67 million in 2021, higher than in both 2020 and 2019 but broadly stable as a proportion of the House's sales (4-5%).\n\n## Other Houses\n\nThe  Other  Houses  directly  operated  533  stores  as  of December 31, 2021, an increase of 83 year-on-year. This rise was mainly attributable to store openings by Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen in Asia, but also in North America. Another key  development  was  the  expansion  of  the  Jewelry  Houses' store network, with new openings again focused in Asia.\n\nThis  is  making  the  network  more  geographically  balanced, with  262  stores  in  mature  markets  and  271  in  emerging markets as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThese developments naturally led to an increase in the Other Houses'  operating  investments,  which  totaled  \u20ac180  million. That represents an increase of \u20ac26 million relative to 2020, a year in which the Houses maintained their investment efforts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  notably  describes membership  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  application  of  the principle  of  balanced  representation  of  women  and  men  on  the Board,  the  conditions  of  preparation  and  organization  of  the work of the Board, compliance with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies to which the Company refers, and the remuneration policy for corporate\n\nofficers,  as  laid  down  by  the  Board.  In  addition,  this  report indicates  any  potential  limitations  set  by  the  Board  on  the powers  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Group  Managing Director of the Company.\n\nThe Board of Directors approved the full report, including the remuneration policy for corporate officers,  at  its  meeting  on February  16,  2022  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Articles  L.  225-37  and  L.  22-10-8  of  the  French  Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n## 1.1 Reference Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company refers to the Corporate Governance Code of Listed Corporations resulting from the consolidation of the October 2003 AFEP and MEDEF reports, the January 2007 and October 2008 AFEP-MEDEF  recommendations  on  remuneration  of  executive corporate officers, the April 2010  recommendations  on strengthening the representation of women on boards, the June 2013  recommendations  on  S ay-on-Pay shareholder  votes, stricter 'comply or explain' requirements and the\n\nestablishment of the High Committee on Corporate Governance (Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise), the November  2016  recommendations  relating  in  particular  to independence,  CSR  and  remuneration  of  executive  corporate officers, and the June 2018 recommendations relating notably to the tasks of the Board of Directors, as amended on January 30, 2020 (the 'AFEP-MEDEF Code').\n\n## 1.2 Combination of executive management roles\n\nIn 2005, PPR adopted a governance structure with a Board of Directors and appointed Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nFollowing  discussions  within  the  Appointments  Committee, the  Board  elected  to  combine  the  roles  of  Chairman  of  the Board  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  to  renew  this  choice after  the  Combined  General  Meeting  of  June  18,  2013,  when the shareholders decided to reappoint Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault as a Director, considering that this arrangement was more in tune  with  Kering's  specific  characteristics.  The  decision  to combine  the  roles  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  Chief Executive  Officer  was  considered  best  suited  to  the  Group's organization,  operating  procedures  and  activities.  Following the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  April  22,  2021,  the  Board  of Directors  confirmed  its  decision  to  appoint  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn its decision, the Board took particular note of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault's particular position as controlling shareholder and his very  active  involvement  in  conducting  the  Group's  business affairs,  of  which  he  has  in-depth  operational  knowledge  and extensive experience. The Board also underlined the benefits\n\nof  combining  executive  management  roles  following  the Group's transformation drive on the grounds that this makes for  an  effective  strategic  decision-making  process,  helps  to optimize  the  Group's  economic  and  financial  performance, and provides strong, consistent communication.\n\nThis arrangement is also aligned with the Group's shareholder structure,  which  includes  individual  investors,  a  controlling shareholder and institutional shareholders, all of whom have a stake in Kering's long-term development.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Pinault, founder of the Group, is Honorary Chairman of the Board of Directors, but is not a Director.\n\nIn addition, given that the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are combined and to provide additional assurance  with  regard  to  the  Board's  operating  rules  and balance  of  power,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  at  its meeting of February 11, 2019, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, to create the role of  Lead  Independent  Director,  with  the  duties  described  in section 1.5 of this chapter, as well as in the Board of Directors' Internal Rules.\n\n## 1.3 Complementary nature of the duties of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director\n\nPursuant to a decision made on February 26, 2008, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus, at that time PPR's Chief Financial Officer, was appointed as  a  Director  and  Group  Managing Director. At the Combined General  Meetings  of  June  18,  2013,  April  27,  2017  and April 22, 2021, the shareholders decided to reappoint him as a Director for four years. At their meetings held subsequent to each of the Combined General Meetings, the Board of Directors also decided to reappoint him as Group Managing Director for the same  period,  acting  on  a  recommendation  of  the  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAlongside the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Group Managing Director is directly responsible for operations at several of Kering's Houses and participates actively in formulating the Group's overall strategy.\n\nIn his capacity as Group Managing Director and in compliance with the authorizations expressly granted to the Group Managing Director by the Board of Directors pursuant to the Company's Articles  of  Association,  the  Board  has  granted  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus  the  same  powers  to  represent  and  bind  the  Company vis-\u00e0-vis  third  parties  as  those  conferred  upon  the  Chief Executive Officer.",

        "page_content": "## 1.4 Balance of power on the Board of Directors\n\nWith a view to achieving and maintaining an effective balance of  power  on  its  Board,  the  Group  takes  steps  to  ensure  that membership is suitably balanced and diverse. Members of the Board  have  backgrounds  in  a  variety  of  industries  and  are mainly independent (six out of the eleven Board members, not counting the directors representing employees, or 55%), including the Lead Independent Director. As of February 16, 2022, eight of  the  Board's  13  members  are  women  (55%  excluding  the Directors  representing  employees).  This  demonstrates  that women are well-represented on the Board of Directors, with a proportion  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  which  states  that  at  least  40%  of  Board members must be women.\n\nThe operating rules and procedures of the Board of Directors are defined by law and the Company's Articles of Association, along  with  the  internal  rules  of  the  Board  and  its  four specialized Committees, as described in section 2 of this chapter:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration Committee;\n- \u00b7 Appointments and Governance Committee;\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe specific provisions of the Company's Articles of Association regarding Directors are in line  with  basic  legal  requirements. There are special provisions for the term of office of Directors (four years, renewable), the age limit (no more than one-third of  the  Directors  may  be  over  70),  the  Directors  representing employees  (one  appointed  by  Kering's  Social  and  Economic Committee and the other by the European Works Council) and the minimum number of shares (50) that must be owned by each Director, except the Directors representing employees, in accordance  with  Article  L.  225-25  of  the  French  Commercial Code.\n\nIn order  to  ensure  a  streamlined  renewal  process  for membership  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  shareholders decided at the Combined General Meeting of May 7, 2009 to stagger reappointments of Directors.\n\nDirectors  are  expected  to  attend  meetings  and  be  fully committed  to  the  work  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees, which benefit from the diverse backgrounds, skills and expertise of  their  members.  Directors  with  in-depth,  long-standing knowledge  of  the  Group  are  a  perfect  complement  to  newly appointed  Directors,  who  bring  a  fresh  perspective  on  the Group and help it move forward.\n\nNotwithstanding the legal provisions governing the authorizations that must be granted by the Board (related-party agreements, endorsements,  suretyships  and  guarantees,  divestments  of shareholdings  or  sale  of  real  estate,  etc.),  Article  15  of  the Company's  Articles  of  Association  states  that  the  following decisions require the prior approval of the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 matters and transactions that have a substantive effect on the strategy of the Company or more generally of the Group, its financial structure or its scope of business activity;\n- \u00b7 except  in  the  event  of  a  decision  by  the  Annual  General Meeting, issues of securities of all types, that are liable to cause a change in the share capital;\n- \u00b7 the following transactions by Kering SA or by any entity controlled by the Group, insofar as they each exceed \u20ac500 million, an amount set annually by the Board of Directors:\n- - all investments or divestments, including the acquisition, sale  or  exchange  of  holdings  in  all  existing  or  future businesses,\n- - all purchases or sales of Group real estate.\n\nThe  internal  rules  of  the  Board  provide  that  Directors  must inform  the  Board  of  any  existing  or  potential  conflict  of interest with Kering SA or any other Group company, and must not  attend  deliberations  of  or  vote  on  any  matters  that concern  them  directly  or  indirectly.  Each  year,  the  Board  of Directors assesses the position of the Directors with regard to conflicts of interest.\n\nThe internal rules are revised on a regular basis to bring them into line with changes in governance rules and practices. The latest changes to date are presented in detail in section 2.2.1 of this chapter.\n\nThe  internal  rules  are  published  in  full  on  the  Company's website.\n\nAs indicated above, each Committee has its own internal rules, which are updated on a regular basis. The most recent update concerned  the  internal  rules  of  the  Audit  Committee,  which now include rules for the approval of non-audit services that may be provided by Statutory Auditors or their networks.\n\nAll Directors are entitled to attend specific meetings of Committees of which they are not a member, if they so wish, but without voting rights.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code,  every  three  years  the  Board  of  Directors  appoints  an independent  expert  to  carry  out  a  formal  assessment.  Each year,  the  Board  also  organizes  a  discussion  on  its  work.  This annual  assessment  by  the  Board  concerns  its  membership, organization and operating rules. It takes place in two stages:\n\n- \u00b7 a questionnaire is issued to each Director;\n- \u00b7 each  Director  meets  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  or  a person designated by the Chairman, using the questionnaire as the starting point for discussions.\n\nAt the end of these meetings, the Directors set new objectives for improving the quality of their organization and ensure that all important issues have been suitably prepared and addressed.\n\nTo  ensure  the  balance  of  power  among  the  Company's governance bodies, meetings are organized without the executive corporate  officers  at  least  once  a  year,  in  line  with  the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  held  an  ESG  roadshow between December  6  and  9,  2021  attended  by  several  investors accounting at those dates for around 46.1% of the Company's\n\nfree float (or 26.6% of its total share capital). The presentation used at the roadshow is available from the Company's website.\n\nThe conditions of preparation and organization of the work of the  Board  of  Directors  are  described  in  section  2.2  of  this chapter.\n\n## 1.5 Role and responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director\n\n## 1.5.1 Presentation of the Lead Independent Director\n\nIn  light  of  changes  to  the  membership  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  following  a  discussion  with  the  Company's shareholders in late  2018,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to include  a  Lead  Independent  Director  in  its  membership  to provide  additional  assurance  with  regard  to  the  Board's operating rules and balance of power.\n\nActing  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors created at its meeting of February 11, 2019 the position of Lead Independent Director and appointed Sophie L'H\u00e9lias to serve in that role.\n\nAt  the  Board  of  Directors'  meeting  of  March  4,  2022,  Sophie L'H\u00e9lias  announced  her  resignation  from  her  position  as Director on Kering's Board owing to her recent appointment as Chairwoman of the Board of Directors of a company outside the Group.\n\n## 1.5.2 Lead Independent Director's responsibilities and powers\n\n## Organization of the work of the Board of Directors and relationship with Directors\n\nThe Lead Independent Director:\n\n- \u00b7 is consulted on the agenda and schedule of Board meetings and may propose additional agenda items to the Chairman;\n- \u00b7 liaises  between  the  independent  Directors,  other  Board members  and  Executive  Management.  This  includes maintaining  regular,  open  dialogue  with  each  of  the Directors,  particularly  with  the  independent  Directors,  and organizing  at  least  one  meeting  per  year  without  the executive corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 prevents  conflicts  of  interest,  notably  by  bringing  to  the Board's attention any potential conflicts of interest identified involving executive corporate officers or other Board members;\n- \u00b7 ensures  compliance  with  the  Board  of  Directors'  internal rules;\n- \u00b7 participates in the process of assessing the Board of Directors.\n\nA loss of independent status would immediately put an end to the Director's role as Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director's responsibilities are described in the internal regulations of the Board of Directors.\n\n- 98\n\n## Relationship with shareholders\n\nThe Lead Independent Director:\n\n- \u00b7 in coordination with the Chairman of the Board, represents the  Board  in  its  dealings  with  investors  concerning environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  matters.  This includes  meeting  with  certain  shareholders  and  reporting their ESG-related questions back to the Board;\n- \u00b7 familiarizes  itself  with  shareholders'  requests  concerning corporate governance and ensures that responses are given.\n\n## Resources\n\nThe Lead Independent Director:\n\n- \u00b7 has  access  to  all  documents  and  other  information  they deem  necessary  for  the  performance  of  their  duties  and may request that external technical studies be carried out, at the Company's expense;\n- \u00b7 is  kept  informed  about  the  Company's  activities  on  a regular  basis.  They  may  also  meet  with  operational  or functional  executives,  at  their  request  and  after  having informed the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u00b7 may request the assistance of the Board secretary to carry out their duties.\n\n## Reporting\n\nThe  Lead  Independent  Director  reports  to  the  Board  of Directors on the performance of its duties once a year. It may also be asked by the Chairman to report on its actions during Annual General Meetings.\n\nAt the end of each Lead Independent Director's term of office, the  Board  of  Directors  reviews  the  role  of  Lead  Independent Director and the associated powers in order to adapt them if necessary.\n\nIn addition, the Lead Independent Director provides the Board with a summary of the work carried out during the year.\n\n## Work carried out in 2021\n\nThe Lead Independent Director, Sophie L'H\u00e9lias, met with all the  Directors  and  Executive  Committee  members  during  the year.  She  also  met  with  members  of  the  legal,  human resources, investor relations, finance and sustainability teams, as well as several operating teams.",

Ten Directors attended the December 9, 2021 meeting;\n- \u00b7 contributed to dialogue with the Company's main shareholders, by meeting during the ESG roadshow held in December 2021 with 13 key investors, representing around 46.1% of the free float (and 26.6% of total share capital) to promote constructive dialogue on strategic governance and sustainability issues (ESG);\n- \u00b7 reported to Directors on discussions with investors;\n- \u00b7 attended  all  the  meetings  of  the  Audit,  Remuneration, Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  as  well  as  the Sustainability Committee.\n\n## 1.6 Dialogue with Executive Management and operational divisions\n\nThe Directors can take up matters with Executive Management at  any  time  and  with  complete  transparency,  and  Executive Management  keeps  the  Directors  regularly  informed  of  all important events concerning the Company's business affairs. The Board has the resources to freely discuss all matters that concern it, particularly issues relating to the Group's strategic direction,  the  implementation  of  that  direction  and  its monitoring. The Directors are also provided in advance with all of  the  information  they  need  to  make  free  and  informed decisions  and  help  Executive  Management  draw  up  meeting agendas.\n\nThe  Board  may  also  call  on  any  advisors  or  consultants  to obtain an independent expert opinion on any topics presented to it by the Company.\n\nEach  Director  is  also  entitled,  if  they  so  wish,  to  meet  the Group's senior executives outside these meetings in order to gain  a  better  insight  into  the  Group's  businesses  or  certain operational issues.\n\nThe  Board's  membership  and  modus  operandi  guarantee  it always acts  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Group.  It  serves  as  a forum for reflection providing invaluable support for Executive Management and ensures the interests of all stakeholders are protected.\n\nAs  part  of  the  regular  procedure  for  reviewing  agreements, including those entered into in the ordinary course of business and  at  arm's  length,  as  described  in  section  2.2.1  of  this chapter, the Directors may consult the Legal Department and, where necessary, the Finance Department from time to time.\n\nThe  Board  can  meet  with  Group  senior  executives  at  certain meetings of the Board of Directors or its Committees.\n\n## 2 MEMBERSHIP OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND INFORMATION ON CORPORATE OFFICERS\n\n## 2.1 Membership of the Board of Directors as of February 16, 2022\n\nThe Board is composed of Directors with wide and diversified experience, relating in particular to corporate strategy, finance, governance, insurance, economics, corporate social responsibility, the  retail  sector,  industry,  accounting,  management  and supervision  of  commercial  and  financial  corporations.  The Articles of Association provide for a renewable four-year term of office for Directors.\n\nIn order to avoid reappointing the entire Board simultaneously and to facilitate a smooth renewal process, at the Combined General Meeting held on May 7, 2009 the shareholders adopted an  amendment  to  Article  10  of  the  Company's  Articles  of Association staggering reappointments of Directors.\n\nAfter reviewing the Board of Directors' report and the favorable opinion  issued  by  the  Company's  Social  and  Economic Committee, the shareholders decided at the General Meetings of May 6, 2014 and June 16, 2020 to amend Article 10 of the Articles of Association in order to establish the procedure for appointing  Directors  representing  employees  in  accordance with the French law of June 14, 2013 in relation to job security.\n\nOn February 16, 2022, the Board of Directors was composed of 13  members,  six  of  whom  are  independent  Directors  (55%, excluding directors representing employees) according to the AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  the  Board  of  Directors'  criteria  (see section 2.2.5 of this chapter), and two of whom were appointed to represent employees, one by Kering's Social and Economic Committee and the other by the European Works Council.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Subject  to  the  powers  expressly  granted  to Annual General Meetings and within the limit of the corporate purpose, the Board reviews all issues concerning the smooth running of the Company and acts on all matters over which it has authority.\n\nThe Board carries out the controls and verifications it deems appropriate.\n\nIn  compliance  with  AMF  recommendation  no.  2012-05,  the Board  has  adopted  internal  guidelines  on  the  identification, control and evaluation of related-party and ordinary agreements  to  ensure  that  agreements  entered  into  in  the ordinary course of business and at arm's length actually meet the required criteria, in accordance with Article L. 22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn  addition  to  reiterating  the  regulations  applicable  to  the identification and classification of related-party and ordinary agreements (notably by the Company's Legal Department, with the assistance, where necessary, of the Finance Department), the  guidelines  also  provide  for  the  regular  control  and evaluation  of  related-party  and  ordinary  agreements  by  the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. Anyone directly or indirectly involved in an agreement cannot participate in its evaluation.\n\nThe conditions of preparation and organization of the work of the  Board  of  Directors  are  defined  by  law,  the  Company's Articles of Association, the internal rules of the Board and the work of its specialized Committees. The Board has established internal rules for each Committee.\n\nUnder  its  internal  rules  and  by  law,  the  Board  of  Directors meets at least four times a year. To allow Directors to prepare as effectively as possible for the topics to be examined during the meeting, a comprehensive pack of information is sent to them  in  due  time  ahead  of  the  meeting;  it  includes  the necessary  information  on  all  items  on  the  agenda.  These documents  are  made  available  to  the  Directors  on  a collaborative platform specially set up for Board members so that documents can be shared securely.\n\nIn line with the relevant regulatory requirements, the internal rules  also  set  the  rules  applicable  to  Directors  in  relation  to restrictions  on  trading  in  the  securities  of  the  Company,  or more generally  the  Group,  by  establishing  black-out  periods. To this end:\n\n- \u00b7 the Directors must refrain from trading directly or indirectly in  the  listed  securities  and  financial  instruments  of  the Company and the Group for a period of 30 calendar days preceding each of the periodic publications relating to the annual and half-year consolidated financial statements and 15 calendar days preceding each of the quarterly publications relating to consolidated revenue and ending at the close of the  trading  day  following  the  publication  of  the  relevant official press release. In no way does this black-out period replace the legal and regulatory provisions regarding insider trading  with  which  each  member  of  the  Board  must comply at the time they decide to trade,  no  matter  when this might occur outside the defined black-out periods;\n- \u00b7 the same obligations apply to each Director insofar as they have knowledge of inside information. In compliance with current regulations, the internal rules also require Directors to declare trading in these securities.\n\nThe  internal  rules  set  the  frequency  and  conditions  of Board  meetings  and  provide  for  meeting  participation  by videoconference and/or conference call.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The diversity principles applied to membership of the Board of Directors are also applied more broadly across the  Group  via  a  gender  diversity  policy  for  its  management bodies. Pursuant to this policy, as of the date of this Report on corporate  governance,  the  Executive  Committee  members included four women out of a total of 12 members, or a ratio of one third.\n\nThe  appointment  on  October  1,  2019  of  a  Chief  Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Officer, who reports to the Chief People Officer,  marked  a  new  milestone  in  Kering's  commitment  to accelerating and expanding its actions in support of diversity,\n\nequality and inclusion - in the broadest sense of the term. In addition, in line with the Group's 2025 sustainability strategy, a  diversity  in  the  workforce  criterion,  with  a  particular emphasis on achieving gender balance, is incorporated in the process of determining the annual and multi-annual variable remuneration of the Group's executive corporate officers. This criterion is described in section 4 of this chapter.\n\nIn addition to furthering its commitment to social responsibility, the Group believes that diversity and inclusion help to foster creativity and innovation, and as such economic performance. As part  of  its  sustainability  strategy,  Kering  has  set  a  target  of achieving a balanced gender mix and equal pay at all levels of the organization by 2025.\n\nKering has defined and put in place an action plan to achieve a balanced  gender  mix  -  especially  within  the  Group's  senior management  (Top  450  roles)  -  by  2025.  This  will  notably involve:\n\n- \u00b7 measuring the representation of women in talent pools and succession plans;\n- \u00b7 integrating gender equality in the recruitment process;\n- \u00b7 monitoring  promotions  within  the  Group  by  gender  and management level;\n- \u00b7 measuring  gender  parity  at  each  management  level  on  a quarterly basis in all the Group's Houses using key indicators.\n\nEfforts made to achieve these objectives include:\n\n- \u00b7 encouraging participation in women's leadership programs;\n- \u00b7 introducing  a  mentoring  program  for  women  at  the international level;\n- \u00b7 developing an employee training program;\n- \u00b7 implementing a global parental policy;\n- \u00b7 giving women a voice via the Diversity & Inclusion Committees put in place at all of the Group's Houses.\n\n## 2.2.2 Principles relating to membership of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  regularly  reflects  upon  the  desirable balance  of  its  membership  and  that  of  the  specialized Committees,  particularly in terms of diversity (gender representation,  nationality,  age,  qualifications,  professional experience, etc.).\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code and the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the table below describes the diversity policy applied to members of the Board  of  Directors.  It  indicates  the  criteria  taken  into consideration, the objectives set by the Board, the measures implemented and the results achieved during 2021.",

In addition, the Directors have significant international experience and exposure, as they hold, or have held, positions or directorships in international companies or key positions outside France.\n\n## Selection process for Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  pays  particular  attention  to  the selection of its members. In addition to their ability to act in the interest of all shareholders, the Directors are also chosen for  their  expertise,  experience  and  understanding  of  the strategic  challenges  in  the  market  in  which  the  Group operates. The membership of the Board of Directors must be as diverse as possible, with a wide range of technical skills.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  first  considers  how  it  wishes  its membership  to  evolve  in  the  short  and  medium  term, particularly  by  assessing  the  skills  it  wishes  to  bring  to  the Board, and by taking into account the findings of the external assessment of the Board's work carried out every three years by  an  external  consultant  responsible  for  mapping  expertise and identifying possible needs.\n\nAccordingly,  with  the  support  of  Executive  Management  and the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  the  Board defines  diversity  objectives  for  its  members  in  terms  of nationality,  independence,  representation  between  men  and women, cultural origin, expertise and seniority, with the aim of achieving a balanced  representation  of  Directors  with complementary backgrounds.\n\nFor this purpose, the Appointments and Governance Committee has established a procedure for selecting future members of the  Board  of  Directors.  The  procedure  reflects  the  Board  of Directors'  focus  on  its  membership  and  particularly  on  the diversity of its members, which helps to foster creativity and unlock performance gains.\n\nAccordingly, when considering potential profiles for appointment as  Director,  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee should  discuss  the  experience,  expertise,  special  skills  and talents  of  each  candidate  in  relation  to  the  objectives  and characteristics of the diversity policy for members of the Board of Directors, particularly in terms of nationality, representation between men and women, cultural origin, expertise and seniority.\n\nWhen a seat falls vacant or, more generally, when the Board has expressed its intention to appoint additional members or change its membership, this information is reviewed again.\n\n## 2.2.3 Executive Management\n\nAfter  the  Combined  General  Meeting  on  May  19,  2005,  when the  shareholders  adopted  the  new  Articles  of  Association  of Kering  SA  (then  PPR),  introducing  governance  by  a  Board  of Directors, the Board of Directors opted to combine the duties of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and maintained this option in  May  2009.  This  choice  has  contributed  to  effective governance  in  light  of  the  organization  of  the  Kering  group, within which Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kering SA, the Group's parent company. He is related to the controlling shareholder, is heavily involved in conducting the Group's business, and has specific operational knowledge  and  in-depth  experience  of  this  business.  At  the proposal  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the Board  of  Directors  appointed  a  Group  Managing  Director ( Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 )  whose term of office was renewed on April 22, 2021 and who has the same powers with regard to dealings with third parties as the Chief Executive Officer. The Group Managing Director  was  appointed  as  a  Director  at  the Combined  General  Meeting  on  May  7,  2009  for  a  four-year term, renewed on April 22, 2021 for another four years.\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group Managing Director both participate, on an equal footing, in the work  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  55%  of  whose  members  are independent  Directors.  The  Board  operates  effectively  as  a result  of  frequent  meetings,  the  regular  attendance  of  its members,  the  assistance  of  its  specialized  Committees,  and the presence of a Lead Independent Director.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.4 Limitations set by the Board of Directors on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer and Group Managing Director\n\nIn  connection  with  the  Board  of  Directors'  statutory  role  of determining  the  strategic  direction  of  the  Company  and ensuring  its  implementation,  and  without  prejudice  to  the legal  provisions  governing  the  authorizations  that  must  be granted by the Board (related-party agreements, endorsements, suretyships and guarantees, divestments of shareholdings or sales of real estate, etc.), the Company's Articles of Association provide  that  certain  decisions  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer and  Group  Managing  Director,  by  virtue  of  their  nature  or significance,  require  the  prior  approval  of  the  Board  of Directors:\n\n- a) matters and transactions that have a substantive effect on the Group's strategy, its financial structure or its scope of business activity;\n- b) except  in  the  event  of  a  decision  by  the  Annual  General Meeting, issues of securities of all types, that are liable to cause a change in the share capital;\n- c) the following transactions effected by the Company or by any  entity  controlled  by  the  Group,  insofar  as  they  each exceed an amount set annually by the Board of Directors (\u20ac500 million in 2021):\n- - all investments or divestments, including the acquisition, sale  or  exchange  of  holdings  in  all  existing  or  future businesses,\n- - all purchases or sales of Company real estate.\n\nThese  transactions  are  regularly  submitted  to  the  Board  of Directors, which examines them carefully.\n\n## 2.2.5 Director independence\n\nIn  order  to  assess  whether  a  Director  can  be  classified  as independent and to avoid possible risks of conflicts of interest, the  Board  applies  the  criteria  defined  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code, whereby a Director cannot:\n\n- \u00b7 be an employee or executive corporate officer of the Company, or have been in such position in the past five years;\n- \u00b7 be an employee, executive corporate officer or Director of the  Company's  parent  company  or  of  a  company  that  the latter consolidates, or have been in such a position in the past five years;\n- \u00b7 be an executive corporate officer of a company in which the Company  holds  a  directorship,  directly  or  indirectly,  or  in which an employee appointed as such or a corporate officer of  the  Company  (currently  in  office  or  having  held  office within the past five years) is a Director;\n- \u00b7 be  a  significant  customer,  supplier,  investment  banker  or commercial  banker  of  the  Company  or  the  Group,  or  for which  the  Company  or  the  Group  represents  a  significant portion of the activity;\n- \u00b7 have any close family ties with a corporate officer;\n- \u00b7 have been the auditor of the Company within the past five years;\n- \u00b7 be a Director of the Company for more than twelve years, the  maximum  period  for  which  a  Director  is  considered independent.\n\nEach  year,  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee reviews  the  independence  of  each  Director  in  light  of  the criteria  set  out  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  In  reviewing independence  with  regard  to  the  direct  or  indirect  business relationship criteria, an additional quantitative and qualitative analysis is performed, if necessary, in order to determine the independence of individual Directors where any such business relationship exists.\n\nIn  2021,  further  to  a  review  by  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  meticulously analyzed  -  along  with  all  other  criteria  -  any  business relationships that may exist between the Kering group and the entities  or  groups  in  which  independent  Directors  exercise their duties. Based on the Board's analysis, with the exception of Yseulys Costes and Tidjane Thiam, none of the independent Directors  and  none  of  the  entities  or  groups  in  which  they exercise  their  duties  have  a  business  relationship  with  the Company,  its  Group  or  its  management  team.  The  Board  of Directors  carried  out  a  qualitative  and  quantitative  review  of the  situation  of  Yseulys  Costes,  Chair  and  Chief  Executive Officer  of  Numberly  -  1000mercis  Group,  along  with  the business relationships between Numberly - 1000mercis Group and  Kering  in  2021.  Global  business  between  these  two companies for all activities and for each of the parties is well below  the  1%  materiality  threshold  set  by  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors therefore considers Yseulys Costes to be  an  independent  Director,  particularly  because  there  is  no relationship of economic dependence on either side, and sees value in continuing to benefit from her renowned expertise.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  analyzed  Tidjane  Thiam's situation when he established Freedom Acquisition Corporation I , a  special  purpose acquisition company in which Art\u00e9mis has invested. Prior to this investment, Tidjane Thiam consulted the Chairman  of  the  Board  to  ensure  there  was  no  conflict  of interest.  The  analysis  by  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee  to  confirm  the  independence  and  establish whether there was any conflict of interest was carried out and the  results  shared  with  the  Lead  Independent  Director.  This analysis  found  that  Tidjane  Thiam  maintains  this  business relationship with Art\u00e9mis; the co-investment has no influence over his term of office as a director. This point will be reviewed at  regular  intervals  by  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee and by the Lead Independent Director.\n\nAccordingly, the Board of Directors considers Tidjane Thiam to be an independent director.\n\nLastly,  the  Board  of  Directors  conducted  a  quantitative  and qualitative  review  of  Emma  Watson's  status.  As  a  result  of  a partnership  entered  into  between  Emma  Watson  and  the Group, and acting further to a review by the Appointments and Governance  Committee  on  July  24,  2020,  the  Board  had deemed  it  inappropriate  to  consider  this  Director  as independent.  Since  the  partnership  did  not  ultimately  go ahead, the Board of Directors decided on February 16, 2021, acting on a proposal from the Appointments and Governance Committee  to  consider  Emma  Watson  as  an  independent director  as  there  are  no  material  business  relationships between the Kering group and this Director.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAccordingly, six of the eleven (1) Directors (serving on the Board as  of  February  16,  2022)  were  therefore  classified  as  independent: Yseulys  Costes,  Daniela  Riccardi,  Sophie  L'H\u00e9lias,  Jean  Liu, Emma Watson and Tidjane Thiam. The Group thus satisfies the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, namely that 'at least  one-third'  of  Board  members  should  be  independent Directors in companies with controlling shareholders, which is the case for Kering.\n\n## 2.2.6 Succession plan\n\nIn collaboration  with  the  Company's  management,  the Appointments and Governance Committee periodically reviews the succession plan for the Group's senior executives and for current  or  prospective  members  of  its  Executive  Committee. This allows it to establish and update a succession plan that covers different time frames:\n\n- \u00b7 short term: unplanned succession (resignation, death, sudden inability to perform role);\n- \u00b7 medium term: accelerated succession (performance problem, management error);\n- \u00b7 long term: planned succession (retirement, end of term of office).\n\nCollaboration  between  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee and the Company's management team ensures the overall  coherence  of  the  succession  plan  and  monitoring  of key  positions.  The  effectiveness  of  the  approach  has  been demonstrated,  when  the  arrival  of  executives  or  Creative Directors of certain of the Group's Houses has led to a rebound or an acceleration in organic growth for the Houses concerned.\n\nThe  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  continues  to apply the same method to prepare a succession plan for the Executive  Committee  and  for  a  certain  number  of  key positions within the Group. In addition, the Company's senior management  continued  the  process  of  drawing  up  a management  succession  plan,  which  was  examined  by  the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  at  its  meeting  on February 4, 2022. The method selected takes into account the Group's  specific  characteristics,  particularly  in  terms  of governance.  Various  phases  have  been  defined.  The  first\n\ninvolves determining the potential changes in governance that would be required in the event of a change at the Company's helm, based on an extensive study of organizational practices in  the  industry  and  among  Kering's  CAC  40  peers.  The  next phase involves identifying the key characteristics required to implement  the  strategic  plan  defined  by  the  Board  and  the principles that govern the relationship between the Corporate and the Group's House teams. This serves as the groundwork for  the  final  phase,  which  consists  in  drawing  up  a  list  of potential candidates.\n\n## 2.2.7 Director induction and training\n\nUpon  joining  the  Board,  new  Directors  may  receive  training tailored to their specific needs within the Board, should they deem  it  necessary.  Meetings  are  organized  with  the  Lead Independent Director, the Group Managing Director and with the Group's executives to give them an insight into the Group and into each of its businesses.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of French law no. 2019-486 of  May  22,  2019  on  business  growth  and  transformation (known  as  the  PACTE  law)  on  the  time  needed  for  Directors representing  employees  to  carry  out  their  duties  and  the arrangements for their training within the Company, the Board of Directors decided  (i) to give Directors representing employees sufficient time to prepare for each Board meeting and (ii) to provide them with a minimum of 40 hours' training per  year  during  their  term  of  office.  In  this  respect,  since joining Kering's Board of Directors, Claire Lacaze has attended a training course organized by the French Institute of Directors ( Institut Fran\u00e7ais des Administrateurs - IFA), as well as internal training sessions given by some of the Company's functional divisions. Concetta Battaglia, the second Director representing employees,  had  several  meetings  with  the  Group  Managing Director,  the  Lead  Independent  Director  and  the  Board secretary  to  continue  her  internal  training  program,  which began  when  she  first  took  office  in  2020,  concerning  the specific features of Kering's Board, ahead of external training.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board's  work  is  assessed  regularly,  as described in section 2.3.2 of this chapter.\n\n## 2.3 Activity of the Board of Directors and its specialized Committees\n\n2.3.1 Activity of the Board of Directors in 2021 and up to February 16, 2022\n\n## Activity of the Board of Directors in 2021\n\nDuring 2021, the Board met ten times (including videoconference and conference calls).",

The  relevant  Committee  Chair  reports  on these preliminary meetings at each Board meeting.\n\nIn  addition,  at  the  Lead  Independent  Director's  initiative, members of the Board met on December 9, 2021 to consider the agenda set forth in the above table, without the Company's executive corporate officers (the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director). The Lead Independent Director also met individually with the Directors during the year.\n\nTo maintain ongoing dialogue with its investors, the Company continued  to  organize  meetings  with  its  shareholders  and other members of the financial community in 2021.\n\nAt  the  initiative  of  its  Board  of  Directors,  the  Company  has forged  a  stronger  dialogue  with  investors  since  2018,\n\nparticularly  on  governance  issues.  Given  the  approach  was unanimously  applauded  by  the  investors  involved,  it  was continued  in  subsequent  years,  broadening  the  scope  to include environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. A roadshow program dedicated to ESG was therefore prepared by the Lead Independent Director (whose role is described in detail  in  section  1.5  of  this  chapter),  with  support  from  the Board  secretary,  the  Chief  Sustainability  Officer,  the  Investor Relations  Department  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer.  The program is described in section 1.4 of chapter 4.\n\n## Activity of the Board of Directors in 2022, up to February 16\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, the Board of Directors has met once,  on  February  16,  2022,  to  approve  the  2021  annual financial  statements  and  reports  to  be  submitted  to  the Annual  General  Meeting  and  to  approve  this  report  on corporate  governance.  It  also  heard  a  report  on  the  Group's financial  position.  The  Board  then  granted  and  allocated  the Directors' remuneration for 2021 in accordance with the criteria adopted in March 2014 and amended on February 11, 2020, taking  into  account  the  decisions  made  by  the  Board  of Directors at its meeting on April 21, 2020.\n\nIn  addition,  the  formal  assessment of the Board of Directors by external firm Egon Zehnder laid out below, was presented to the Board at this meeting.\n\n## 2.3.2 Assessment of the Board of Directors' operating rules\n\nSince 2004, in accordance with its internal rules, the Board of Directors has dedicated one item on its agenda, at least once a year,  to  a  discussion  of  its  operating  rules  Every  three  years, this  discussion  is  backed  up  by  a  formal  assessment  of  the Board's operating rules by an independent member or a thirdparty expert.\n\nThe  previous  assessment  conducted  by  a  third-party  expert with  recognized  experience  in  the  governance  of  boards  of directors of listed companies, was carried out in 2019.",

The  assessment  consisted  of  a questionnaire and individual meetings with each Director. In addition to an assessment of the individual contribution made by each Director, the assessment also covered the following points:\n\n- \u00b7 the membership and role of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 induction arrangements for new Directors;\n- \u00b7 the contribution by the Board to the Group's strategy;\n- \u00b7 the role of the Board on ESG issues.\n\nThis  assessment revealed a very positive view of the Board's operating  rules,  with  freedom  of  self-expression,  the  driving force  provided  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  the  Group\n\n## 2.3.3 Specialized Committees\n\n## Audit Committee\n\n## Membership as of February 16, 2022\n\nTidjane Thiam\n\nChair\n\nJean-Pierre Denis\n\nVice-Chair\n\nYseulys Costes\n\nIndependent Director\n\nFinanci\u00e8re Pinault, represented by H\u00e9lo\u00efse Temple-Boyer\n\nDirector\n\nSophie L'H\u00e9lias\n\nIndependent Director\n\nJean Liu\n\nIndependent Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Duties\n\nSet up in December 2002, the main role of the Audit Committee, within  the  limit  of  the  duties  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  is  to review the annual and interim financial statements, to verify the relevance,  consistency  and  reliability  of  accounting  methods applied in the Company and at the Group's main subsidiaries and  the  implementation  of  internal  control  and  risk management procedures in the Group, to be familiar with the policies implemented  within  the  Group  in  relation  to sustainability  and  respect  for  the  environment,  and  to  hear from  and  put  questions  to  the  Statutory  Auditors.  The Committee  is  notified  of  the  main  issues  identified  by  the Kering group's Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Audit Committee reports to the Board on a regular basis and  provides  it  with  opinions  or  recommendations  on  all matters  within  its  scope  of  duties.  Meetings  of  the  Audit Committee are recorded in a written and approved report.\n\nIn exercising its role, the Committee is supported, in addition to the external auditors, by the Chief Financial Officer and the Group's Internal Audit Director, plus the General Counsel, who are  brought  in  to  present  their  work  and  answer  the Committee's  questions.  The  Committee  can  also  retain external specialists and hear from any other individuals.\n\nEach  year,  it  reviews  the  fees  charged  by  the  Company's Statutory Auditors and assesses their independence. The Audit Committee  also  considers  potential  Statutory  Auditors  for appointment.\n\n67 %\n\nof independent Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n87 %\n\nattendance rate in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  addition,  the  Committee  issues  recommendations  to  the Board of Directors in relation to the regular assessment of the terms of the Group's related-party and ordinary agreements. In this context, it reviews payments made under the agreement entered  into  between  Kering  and  Art\u00e9mis  (described  in Note 32 to the consolidated financial statements, included in this document), as well as any changes in such payments, on an annual basis.\n\nThe  members  of  the  Audit  Committee  all  have  recognized financial  or  accounting  skills,  combining  their  expertise  in general and operational management of banks and businesses as confirmed by their professional careers (see section 2.1 of this chapter). Tidjane Thiam, Chair of the Audit Committee and notably  Executive  Chairman  of  SPAC  Freedom  Acquisition Corporation  I and  former  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, brings to this Committee his renowned expertise and financial skills. Jean-Pierre Denis, Vice-Chair of the Committee, was previously Chairman of Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Ark\u00e9a and a Finance Inspector, and has gained considerable executive management experience. Yseulys Costes, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of the  Numberly  -  1000  mercis  group,  H\u00e9lo\u00efse  Temple-Boyer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Art\u00e9mis, and Jean Liu, Chair of Didi Chuwing, also possess respected executive management experience. Given their professional experience (presented in section  2.1:  'List  of  terms  of  office  and  positions  held  by members  of  the  Board  of  Directors')  and  their  first-class knowledge  of  the  accounting  and  financial  procedures applicable  to  groups  of  companies,  all  the  Audit  Committee members have the requisite skills for their roles.\n\nManaging  Director,  and  the  in-depth  analysis  of  issues  were identified  as  strengths.  At  the  initiative  of  the  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors is very mindful of  ESG  issues  and  has  incorporated  them  in  its  enterprise performance  metrics.  The  quality  of  the  work  performed  by the four Committees was also unanimously applauded.\n\nThe  strategic sessions and  presentations  were  greatly appreciated,  backing  up  the  decision  to  involve  the  entire Board  in  these  issues.  That  said,  the  Directors  express  the desire  for  certain  strategic  points  to  be  examined  in  greater depth.\n\nAreas  of  improvement  were  identified  in  terms  of  Board membership to  reflect  the  forthcoming  expiration  of  certain terms of office.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At  this  Annual  General Meeting, which will be held in 2022, it will not be possible to propose  the  reappointment  of  KPMG  SA,  as  the  firm  has reached  the  maximum  engagement  period  for  Statutory Auditors according to the transitional arrangements of the EU Audit  Regulation  (the  first  appointment  of  KPMG  SA  dating back to 1992).\n\nFor  the  purpose  of  effectively  managing  the  transition between KPMG and a new audit firm, as well as avoiding the risk  that  a  firm  accepts  an  engagement  that  is  incompatible with the performance of its duties prior to its appointment, a decision was made in 2020 to launch a tender to identify the firm  that  would  replace  KPMG  as  from  2022,  subject  to shareholder approval at the Ordinary General Meeting called to approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  year  ending December 31, 2021.\n\nOn February 6, 2020, the methodology and timetable for the tender  were  presented  to  the  Audit  Committee,  which approved the main principles.\n\nThe tender took place from May to October 2020 in compliance with  the  specifications  reviewed  by  the  Audit  Committee  on June  4,  2020  and  sent  to  four  major  audit  firms  (EY,  Grant Thornton,  Mazars  and  PwC).  Meetings  were  organized  with\n\nKering's senior managers to give these firms a better grasp of the  Group's  main  financial  matters  as  well  as  its  IT  and internal control environment. Following this process, the firms were invited to formally submit their bids.\n\nA Selection Committee, comprising the Internal Audit Director, the  General  Counsel,  the  Financial  Control  Director  and  the Chief  Financial  Officer,  met  to  assess  the  quality  of  the responses  received  based  on  12  criteria,  only  one  of  which concerned the amount of fees.\n\nThe Selection Committee recommended that the two highest rated  firms  meet  with  the  Group  Managing  Director  and  the Audit Committee Chair.\n\nAfter these meetings held in November 2020, a consensus was reached  to  propose  PricewaterhouseCoopers  as  the  Group's Statutory Auditor at the Annual General Meeting on April 28, 2022.\n\nThe Chair of the Audit Committee submitted the conclusions of  the  tender  to  each  member  of  the  Audit  Committee  in December 2020. The topic was then included as an item on the agenda of the Audit Committee's meeting of February 11, 2021 to confirm the choice of PricewaterhouseCoopers and enable the Finance Department to organize the transition year.\n\n## Work by the Audit Committee in 2021 and up to February 16, 2022\n\nThe  Committee  met  five  times  in  2021,  with  an  average attendance rate of 87%.\n\nDuring  2021,  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  Group  Internal Audit Director were regularly invited to present their work and answer questions at meetings of the Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussed the following:\n\n| The process  of preparing  accounting  and financial  information   | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7   | Review  of  the  accounting  options  for  annual  and  interim  financial  statements,  off-balance  sheet commitments, and the activity report, with an analysis of the COVID-19 impact on the Group's activities Presentation of the progress made on transforming the Finance function and its impact on the control environment   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                     |         | Review of the services performed by Art\u00e9mis in 2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                                     | \u00b7       | Update on the Group's financing and cash management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Internal audit                                                      | \u00b7       | Review of the internal audit activities (audit engagements and follow-up on action plans) during 2021 and early 2022                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                                                                     | \u00b7       | Review of the update to the supply chain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                                                                     | \u00b7       | Presentation and approval of the audit plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Internal  control and risk  management                              | \u00b7       | Review of the internal control activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                                                                     | \u00b7       | Review of the risk management system including the approach to preparing the Group's risk map and presentation of the risk hierarchy (including CSR priorities)                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                                                                     | \u00b7       | Review of the Group's cybersecurity (mapping of cyber risks, action plans and related training)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                                                                     | \u00b7       | Review of the Group's compliance program -

Committee  members  also discussed  the  Group's  ESG  performance,  and  the  initiatives\n\nneeded  to  strengthen  the  mechanisms  for  taking  climate change risks into account throughout the value chain together with the Group's suppliers. In addition, a decision was made at the meeting to appoint a member of the Board of Directors as climate change lead with effect from 2022 and to add the topic as an agenda point at Board meetings twice a year.\n\nOwing to the external commitments of which the Board was aware  in  advance,  Emma  Watson,  Chair  of  the  Sustainability Committee,  was  unable  to  attend  this  meeting.  However, Emma Watson contributed to the work of the Board and the Sustainability  Committee  throughout  2021  through  various discussions  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  the  Lead Independent

As  announced  on  March  4,  2022,  following  the  proposals  to appoint  three  new  Directors,  the  Board  of  Directors  entrusted  the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  with  the  task  of  reshaping membership  of  the  Committees  after  the  April  28,  2022  Annual  General Meeting.\n\nHowever, pending these changes to its membership, the Board of Directors believes this does not impair the effectiveness of the Committee's work. The Committee's  members  are  five  non-executive  Directors,  two  of  whom  are independent  and  one  Director  representing  employees,  ensuring  members can speak freely. In addition, the work, recommendations and opinions of the Committee are reported in detail and discussed at Board meetings by all the Directors.\n\n## Attendance at Annual General Meetings\n\nAll shareholders  are  entitled  to  attend  Annual  General Meetings in accordance with the conditions provided for by law. The terms and conditions of their attendance are specified in the provisions of Article 19 of the Articles of Association and are  set  out  in  Chapter  8  of  this  Universal  Registration Document.\n\n## Information likely to have an impact in the event of a public offer\n\nNo information other than that related to (i) Kering's current shareholding structure (Art\u00e9mis being the majority shareholder, with 41.74% of the share capital and 58.44% of the theoretical voting rights of Kering as of December 31, 2021), (ii) the double voting  right  provided  for  under  the  Articles  of  Association, (iii)  the  Company's  stock  repurchase  program,  and  (iv)  the authorizations  given  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  to increase  the  share  capital,  as  expressly  described  in  this Universal Registration Document, is liable to have an impact in the event of a public tender offer for the Company's shares or could  have  the  effect  of  delaying,  deferring  or  preventing  a change of control of the Company.\n\nTo  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  there  are  no agreements between the Company's shareholders that could restrict  the  transfer  of  Kering  shares  or  the  exercise  of  the corresponding voting rights.\n\nthe  representation  of  women  within  boards,  as  revised  in June  2013,  November  2015,  November  2016  and  June  2018 and amended in January 2020 (the 'AFEP-MEDEF Code') and its  January  2020  application  guide.  These  principles  were notably applied for the preparation of this report on corporate governance.

The  policy  takes  account  of  the recommendations  set  out  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate Governance  Code  of  Listed  Corporations  as  revised  in June 2018 and amended in January 2020, as well as the guide to  developing  universal  registration  documents  published  by\n\nthe  French  financial  markets  authority  ( Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s financiers -  AMF)  on  January  5,  2022  and  the  reports  on corporate  governance  and  executive  remuneration  in  listed companies  issued  by  the  AMF  and  the  High  Committee  on Corporate Governance ( Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise ). The remuneration policy for all corporate officers is an integral part of Kering's report on corporate governance.\n\n## 4.1 Remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director (executive corporate officers) for 2022, subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of April 28, 2022 ( ex-ante vote)\n\nActing on a recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, on  February  16,  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the remuneration  policy  applicable  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director for 2022.\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  Articles  L.  22-10-8  and R.  22-10-14  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the  2022 remuneration  policy  described  below  includes  the  general principles and  criteria for determining, allocating and awarding  the  fixed,  variable  and  exceptional  components making up total remuneration and benefits in kind granted to executive corporate officers in respect of their duties. It will be submitted  for  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  at  Kering's Annual General Meeting, to be held on April 28, 2022.\n\n## 4.1.1 General principles of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director\n\nThe  Company's  remuneration  policy  for  executive  corporate officers is set by the Board  of  Directors, based  on recommendations  from  the  Remuneration  Committee,  and approved each year by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The  remuneration  structure  and  the  criteria  on  which  it  is  based are defined and modified over time to ensure that the amounts paid  are  closely  aligned  with  the  extent  to  which  the  Group's strategic financial and non-financial objectives have been met.\n\nA large proportion of the remuneration of executive corporate officers  is  subject  to  performance  conditions  (84%  for  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and 80% for the Group Managing  Director),  reflecting  their  obligation  to  create medium- and long-term value.\n\nThe variable portion of executive corporate officers' remuneration is subject to performance conditions relating to financial criteria as  well  as  corporate,  social  and  environmental  responsibility, reflecting  the  Group's  ambitious  objectives  in  these  areas,  and encouraging  the  executive  corporate  officers  to  base  their decisions and actions on ensuring long-term profitability.\n\nThe  decision  approved  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of June  16,  2020  to  replace  Kering  Monetary  Units  (KMUs)  with performance shares in the long-term incentive component of executive  corporate  officers'  remuneration  illustrates  the Group's  desire  to  make  the  alignment  between  executive remuneration and shareholder interests even clearer.\n\nThe performance criteria for the executive corporate officers' annual  and  multi-annual  variable  remuneration  are  clear, specific  and  varied.  They  include  both  financial  criteria  -\n\nrecurring  operating  income  (ROI)  and  free  cash  flow  from operations  (FCF)  -  and  non-financial  criteria,  relating  in particular to sustainability, corporate social responsibility and organization and talent management.\n\nThe level of achievement of the financial targets is determined by the Group's Finance Department. The level of achievement of the non-financial targets is first assessed  by  the Remuneration  Committee,  which  reports  thereupon  to  the Board of Directors.  This  assessment  is  based  on  information provided  by  the  Legal,  Sustainability  and  Human  Resources Departments,  members  of  which  may  be  present  during  the meeting to provide commentary.\n\nDecisions  about  the  composition  of  the  executive  corporate officers'  remuneration  and  its  modification  over  time  whether in relation to the balance between fixed and variable components or the choice of performance criteria - are based on  proposals  made  by  the  Remuneration  Committee.  These proposals are predicated, in turn, on analyses and recommendations  provided  by  the  Group's  Sustainability, Human Resources, Remuneration and Employee Benefits, and Legal Departments.\n\nA review of the existing system is carried out annually to assess whether  changes  should  be  made,  based  on  continuous monitoring of market practice and in line with any legislative developments.  Where  appropriate,  it  may  be  supported  by  an assignment  conducted  by  external  consultants.  When  market practices  are  benchmarked  (both  in  terms  of  remuneration levels  and  the  principles  for  determining  and  managing remuneration), comparisons are made  with reference companies selected from the French and international markets on the basis of their size and sector of activity.\n\nThe  decision-making  process  for  the  remuneration  policy  is also  designed  to  avoid  or  address  conflicts  of  interest.  The remuneration  policy  applicable  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director  and  the payment of the variable  components due to them based on the  principles  applied  are  discussed  and  decided  on  by  the Board  of  Directors,  based  on  recommendations  from  the Remuneration  Committee  and  following  the  approval  of  the financial statements for the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe  components  that  make  up  the  remuneration  policy  are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, in compliance  with  Article  L.  22-10-8  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group Managing Director do not participate in either the discussion or  the  vote  during  Remuneration  Committee  or  Board meetings on these topics.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  line  with  recommendation  25.3.1  of  the AFEP-MEDEF Code, it is not reviewed systematically each year.\n\nThe Board of Directors therefore proposes to leave the annual fixed  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director at \u20ac1,200,000 each, a level it had been at for the last five years (1) .\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\nVariable  remuneration  is  designed  to  align  the  reward accruing  to  executive  corporate  officers  with  the  Group's annual  financial  performance  and  its  strategic  long-term environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  objectives.  It  is stated as a percentage of annual fixed remuneration.\n\nOn  February  16,  2022,  acting  on  a  proposal  made  by  the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors decided to adjust the target amounts for the annual variable remuneration of executive corporate officers. When targets are met, annual variable remuneration will now be equal to 150% of  fixed  remuneration  for  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director  (vs.  120%  of  fixed remuneration  for  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer and  100%  of  fixed  remuneration  for  the  Group  Managing Director in the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of April 22, 2021).\n\nWhen targets are exceeded, annual variable remuneration may amount to 203% of fixed remuneration for the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director, provided that the achievement of the financial targets exceeds 125% of the thresholds set and that all non-financial targets are met.\n\nIn  2016,  in  line  with  the  Group's  long-term  strategy  on  ESG issues,  the  Board  decided,  at  the  recommendation  of  the Remuneration  Committee,  to  introduce  equally  weighted non-financial performance criteria that would account for 30% of  annual  variable  remuneration.  The  criteria  are  based  on three  key  areas:  organization  and  talent  management, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability.\n\nAs a result, the annual variable remuneration of the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  of  the  Group  Managing Director is determined as follows:\n\n## Distribution of the annual variable remuneration criteria\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 market research and analyses relating to the remuneration of  people  in  similar  positions  in  comparable  companies. The proposed amount of fixed remuneration is in line with executive pay practices implemented by the Group's CAC 40 and (international) luxury market peers.\n- (1) In  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  impact  on  business  activity,  and  following  the  decision  made  by  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer,  at  its  meeting  of  April  21,  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided,  as  an  exceptional  measure,  to  reduce  the  amount  of  the  fixed remuneration proposed for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for 2020 to an amount of \u20ac960,000.",

For confidentiality reasons, the targets associated with financial criteria are not disclosed at the time they are set but disclosed ex-post for assessing the achievement rate of these targets.\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee, non-financial  targets  are  assessed  each  year  by  the  Board, which  takes  into  account  the  performance  of  the  Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  of  the  Group  Managing Director based on reports and presentations that describe the level of achievement of each target and justify the corresponding remuneration awarded to the executive corporate officers.\n\nThis assessment is based on a detailed proposal prepared by the  Remuneration  Committee,  which  relies  in  particular  on objective information reported by the Chief People Officer, the Head  of  Remuneration  and  Employee  Benefits,  the  Chief Sustainability Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer, in relation to the strategic goals defined at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe  above-described  principles  for  the  determination  of annual  variable  remuneration  of  the  executive  corporate officers will be pursued in 2022 subject to the approval of the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\nTotal variable remuneration due for 2022 will be paid in 2023, following  the  Annual  General  Meeting's  approval  of  the financial  statements.  Payment  is  also  subject  to  the  Annual General Meeting's approval of the 2022 remuneration policy.\n\n## Factors determining the payment of annual variable remuneration\n\nThe factors determining payment of annual variable remuneration are  the  same  as  for  2021  and  function  as  described  in  the table below, it being specified that for confidentiality reasons, specific quantified targets will only be disclosed a posteriori at the time of payment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, for 90% achievement of the target, an executive corporate officer would receive 60% of the annual variable remuneration; or for 110% achievement of the target, 120% of the annual variable remuneration.\n\n## Multi-annual variable remuneration\n\n## Long-term incentive\n\nActing on the recommendation of the Board of Directors and following  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  at  the  Annual General  Meeting  of  June  16,  2020,  the  executive  corporate officers'  long-term  remuneration  was  modified,  effective from  2020,  by  replacing  Kering  Monetary  Units  (KMUs)  with performance share awards.\n\nThis system  serves  to  tighten  the  link between  the remuneration of executive corporate officers and their direct contribution  to  long-term  performance,  while  also  aligning their interests with the interests of shareholders.\n\nThe  performance  share  award  plan  for  executive  corporate officers  is  accompanied  by  a  share  award  plan  for  other employees in key positions within the Group. In addition, the annual  award  of  performance  shares  to  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director  is capped by the Board of Directors  at  20%  of  the  total  shares granted by the Board of Directors during each fiscal year.",

        "page_content": "On  February  16,  2022,  acting  on  a  proposal  made  by  the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors decided to adjust  the  target  amounts  for  the  multi-annual  variable remuneration  of  executive  corporate  officers.  Subject  to shareholders'  approval  at  the  forthcoming  Annual  General Meeting, the value of the multi-annual remuneration will now be  equal  to  150%  and  100%  respectively  of  the  total  annual remuneration  in  cash  for  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director  paid  in  year  Y,  i.e. total  annual  cash-based  remuneration  is  determined  by adding  together  annual  fixed  remuneration  and  variable remuneration due for year Y-1 (vs. 100% for the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  80%  for  the  Group  Managing Director in the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  April  22,  2021),  it  being stipulated  that  the  value  of  this  multi-annual  remuneration will be calculated without taking into account any remuneration that may be paid on a deferred basis.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nActing on the recommendation of the Board of Directors and following  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  at  the  Annual General Meeting of April 22, 2021, the performance conditions governing the multi-annual remuneration of the two executive corporate officers changed to:\n\n- \u00b7 make the number of shares actually obtained following the three-year  vesting  period  conditional  upon  an  overall performance  not  limited  to  the  achievement  of  financial targets,  with  an  additional  focus  on  the  Group's  strategic commitment to ESG issues;\n- \u00b7 introduce stricter requirements for the financial criteria;\n- \u00b7 maintain  the  predominant  impact  of  the  performance  of the  Kering  share  relative  to  that  of  a  reference  index  of luxury goods companies.\n\nThese criteria will again be implemented for 2022.\n\nAccordingly, the number of performance shares awarded to executive corporate officers that ultimately vest is now subject to the criteria and weightings indicated in the table below:\n\n| Criteria

by  a  maximum  proportion  of  50%,  depending  on the performance of the Kering share price (difference in price between the  award  date  of  the  performance  shares  and  the end  of  the  vesting  period)  relative  to  the  performance  of  a reference  index  (followed  in  the  same  way)  over  the  same period.  The  reference  index  comprises  the  shares  of  the following eight listed companies: Burberry, Ferragamo, Herm\u00e8s, LVMH, Moncler, Prada, Richemont and Swatch.\n\nIt follows that the number of vested shares based on financial and non-financial criteria may be reduced by half if the Kering share underperforms the reference index by more than 50%. Conversely,  if  the  Kering  share  outperforms,  the  number  of vested shares based on financial and non-financial criteria may be  increased  in  proportion  to  this  outperformance  by  up to 50%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  is  also  in  line  with  the  Company's  strategy  of  aligning Directors' remuneration with the corporate interest.\n\nThe variable remuneration allocated to the Directors is notably based on their actual presence at meetings of the Board and its specialized Committees and on the time and efforts required of them to prepare for and participate in these meetings. The Lead Independent  Director  receives  additional  remuneration,  which\n\nis subject to the achievement of predefined objectives relating to  his/her  duties.  The  Lead  Independent  Director's  duties  are described in section 1.5.2 of this chapter.\n\nThe  Remuneration  Committee  prepares  and  monitors  the remuneration  policy  for  Directors.  The  total  amount  of remuneration  allocated  to  the  Directors  and  the  allocation criteria  are  approved  by  shareholders  at  the  Annual  General Meeting.\n\nThe Board and Remuneration Committee meetings that deal with the remuneration policy are carried out in strict compliance with the procedures for preventing and managing conflicts of interest, which are described in the Board's internal rules, and Directors do not participate in discussions or votes on resolutions that relate to their own remuneration.\n\n## Supplementary pension plan\n\nExecutive  corporate  officers  will  not  be  eligible  for  any supplementary pension plans.\n\n## Non-competition indemnities\n\nExecutive  corporate  officers  will  not  be  eligible  for  any  such indemnities.\n\n## Benefits in kind\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  benefits  from  an international health insurance and a company car with a driver.\n\nThe  Group  Managing  Director  benefits  from  international health insurance, life and disability insurance and a company car with a driver.\n\n## Draft resolution regarding remuneration of executive corporate officers\n\n## Eleventh resolution: Approval of the remuneration policy for executive corporate officers\n\nDeliberating  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of  quorum  and majority  applicable  to  ordinary  general  meetings  and  having reviewed  the  Board  of  Directors'  report  on  corporate governance, the Annual General Meeting, in application of the provisions  of  Article  L.  22-10-8  of  the  French  Commercial Code, approves  the  remuneration  policy  for  executive corporate officers as described in the aforementioned report, which  is included in the 2021  Universal  Registration Document,  Chapter  3  'Report  on  corporate  governance', section 4.1 'Remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director (executive corporate officers) for 2022, subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of April 28, 2022 ( ex-ante vote)'.",

The higher figure reflects the increased number of Board members, the additional remuneration allocated to the Lead Independent Director, and the special portion allocated to the Sustainability Committee Chair.\n\nDirectors' remuneration is allocated on the basis of the actual presence  of  members  at  meetings  of  the  Board  and  its specialized  Committees  during  the  year.  In  accordance  with applicable legislation and other than in the special circumstances created  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  members  may  not  use videoconferencing or other remote communication technologies to attend meetings discussing the annual financial statements and  the  Management  Report.  Accordingly,  Directors  not physically in attendance at the Board meeting approving the financial  statements are deemed absent and are not eligible for the related remuneration.\n\nThe  breakdown  between  fixed  and  variable  remuneration remains unchanged, at 40% fixed and 60% variable.\n\nDirectors'  remuneration  is  thus  allocated  in  the  following manner:\n\n- \u00b7 a fixed portion, minus (i) a special portion corresponding to the remuneration of the Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration, Appointments and Governance, and Sustainability Committees, respectively (\u20ac23,000 each), (ii) a special portion corresponding to the remuneration of the Committee Vice-Chair (\u20ac11,500), and (iii) a special portion allocated to the Lead Independent\n\nDirector  for  his/her  role  on  the  Board  (\u20ac75,000  for  2022), the balance being allocated with a coefficient of 1 by Board membership, increased by 0.5 per Committee;\n\n- \u00b7 a  variable  portion,  allocated  with  a  coefficient  of  1  per presence  at  each  meeting  of  the  Board  and  0.5  for  each attendance of a Committee meeting.\n\nThe remuneration allocated to the Lead Independent Director will be subject to the achievement of objectives set in advance by  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Lead  Independent  Director's objectives for 2022 will be the following:\n\n- \u00b7 promote  and  maintain  a  good  relationship  between  the Board and its shareholders and investors;\n- \u00b7 coordinate the assessment of the Board and its members;\n- \u00b7 facilitate  and  build  relationships  within  the  Board,  as permitted  by  the  health  situation,  including  by  holding meetings without executive corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  mechanisms  to prevent and resolve potential conflicts of interest;\n- \u00b7 report, on a quarterly basis, to the Chairman of the Board on the performance of her duties.\n\n## Draft resolution regarding remuneration of corporate officers\n\n## Twelfth resolution: Approval of the remuneration policy for corporate officers in respect of their duties as Directors\n\nDeliberating  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of  quorum  and majority  applicable  to  ordinary  general  meetings  and  having reviewed  the  Board  of  Directors'  report  on  corporate governance, the Annual General Meeting, in application of the provisions  of  Article  L.  22-10-8  of  the  French  Commercial Code, approves the remuneration policy for corporate officers in  respect  of  their  duties  as  Directors  as  described  in  the aforementioned  report,  which  is  included  in  the  2021 Universal Registration Document, Chapter 3 'Report on corporate governance',  section  4.2  'Remuneration  policy  applicable  to the  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  for  2022,  subject to  approval  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  April  28,  2022 ( ex-ante vote)' (non-executive corporate officers).\n\n## 4.3 Report on the remuneration paid during or awarded for 2021 to corporate officers in respect of their duties ( ex-post vote)\n\n## 4.3.1 Remuneration paid during or awarded for 2021 to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director (executive corporate officers) in respect of their duties\n\nThe remuneration of the executive corporate officers for 2021 includes a fixed portion and a variable portion. The Board of Directors  establishes  the  rules  for  setting  the  remuneration each year based on the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe components of remuneration - including the way in which they  contribute  to  the  Company's  long-term  performance  and the way performance criteria have been applied - have been established  in  compliance  with  the  remuneration  policy  for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director  approved  by  shareholders  at  the  Annual  General Meeting of April 22, 2021 (11 th resolution).\n\n<!-- image -->",

conditions and  the  service  condition  have  been  met,  the  number  of vested  performance  shares  will  be  adjusted  upward  or downward by  a  maximum  proportion  of  50%,  depending  on the performance of the Kering share price (difference in price between the award date of the plan and the end of the vesting period)  relative  to  the  performance  of  a  reference  index (followed  in  the  same  way)  over  the  same  period.

The  previous  long-term  incentive  system  (which applied  from  2013  to  2019)  was  based  on  Kering  Monetary Units  (KMUs).  The  value  of  these  KMUs  is  indexed  equally  to both  absolute  changes  in  the  Kering  share  price  and  to changes in the Kering share price relative to a basket of seven luxury  stocks  (Burberry,  Ferragamo,  LVMH,  Prada,  Richemont, Swatch and Tod's).\n\nKMUs have a vesting period of three years as from January 1 of the  year  in  which  they  are  granted,  after  which  they  may  be cashed in by the beneficiaries over a two-year period (during two windows each year), when the beneficiaries may receive the cash equivalent of their KMUs based on the last assessed value.  Past  awards  of  KMUs  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director, which have become  available  or  are  still  vesting,  are  presented  in  the tables on page 157.\n\nTo align the multi-annual variable remuneration system with the  Group's  long-term  performance,  vesting  of  the  KMUs awarded to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group  Managing  Director  is  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of performance  criteria  based  on  three  financial  indicators assessed at Group level:\n\n- \u00b7 recurring operating income;\n- \u00b7 free cash flow from operations;\n- \u00b7 recurring operating margin.\n\nUnder  this  system  put  in  place  in  2017,  if  an  increase  is observed in at least one of these three indicators between the average  amount  over  the  three-year  vesting  period  and  the amount shown in Kering's  consolidated  financial  statements for the year preceding the year of the grant, 100% of the KMUs granted  may  be  cashed  in  (the  change  in  each  indicator  is measured at constant scope and as reported). Failing this, no KMUs may be cashed in.\n\nStarting  in  2019,  in  line  with  the  remuneration  policy approved  by  shareholders  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of April 24, 2019, the following system has applied:\n\n- \u00b7 three criteria met: 100% of the KMUs vest,\n- \u00b7 two of three criteria met: 75% of the KMUs vest,\n- \u00b7 one of three criteria met: 50% of the KMUs vest;\n- \u00b7 no criteria met: no KMUs may be cashed in.\n\nThe  financial  criteria  are  based  on  the  indicators  used  to assess  the  Group's  performance.  The  mechanism  in  place meets stricter requirements, since the KMU value is not per se a  performance condition but influences the amount actually paid at the exercise date.",

This value is then  weighted  for  the  performance  of  the  Kering  share relative to the basket of benchmark stocks.\n\nAt  the  end  of  each  six-month  period,  the  value  of  a  KMU  is calculated as follows:\n\nUVs+1 = UVs x ([1+VKs+1] + ([1+VKs+1] x [1+VKs+1] / [1+VPVs+1])) / 2\n\nWhere:\n\nUV = Unit of Value.\n\ns+1 = the six-monthly closing date at which the unit of value is assessed (06/30 or 12/31).\n\n- s = the previous six-monthly closing.\n\nVK = the change in the Kering share price over the six-month period,  using  the  average  share  price  over  the  30  days preceding the six-monthly closing as the reference price.\n\nVPV = the change in the price of a basket of stocks over the six-month period, equal to the arithmetic average change in these stocks, using the average share price over the 30 days preceding the six-monthly closing as the reference price.\n\nThe following companies  were  used  to  compile  the benchmark:  Burberry,  Ferragamo,  LVMH,  Prada,  Richemont, Swatch and Tod's.\n\n<!-- image -->",

fees);\n\n- \u00b7 exceptional remuneration (where applicable);\n- \u00b7 benefits in kind.\n\nFor  the  employees  (on  a  full-time  equivalent  basis),  the components of remuneration taken into account are:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed remuneration;\n- \u00b7 annual variable remuneration paid in year Y for year Y-1;\n- \u00b7 individual bonuses;\n- \u00b7 profit-sharing and incentives paid in year Y;\n- \u00b7 the value of performance shares granted during the year at their IFRS value;\n- \u00b7 the value of any other long-term incentives awarded;\n- \u00b7 benefits in kind.\n\nThe ratios are calculated on the basis of remuneration paid and awarded during the year.\n\nTo make them more representative, these fairness ratios have been calculated for two different scopes of analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 employees  of  the  economic  and  social  unit  (ESU) comprising the Kering group holding companies (Kering SA and Kering Finance), or 615 employees;\n- \u00b7 the  Kering  ESU  employees  and  the  French  employees  of Saint  Laurent,  Balenciaga  and  Gucci,  or  2,986  employees, representing 77% of the Group's employees based in France.\n\nData for the larger scope of analysis are available only from 2019, when the joint payroll system that can provide such consolidated figures was introduced.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus held the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Group Managing Director, respectively, during the five-year period in question.",

They are not entitled to any conditional or deferred remuneration.\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  February  16,  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors decided,  upon  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration Committee, to allocate remuneration to Directors in respect of their  duties  on  the  basis  of  the  actual  presence  of  members at  meetings  of  the  Board  and  of  its  specialized  Committees during the year.\n\nFollowing  shareholders'  approval  at  the  Annual  General Meeting on April 22, 2021, the total remuneration allocated to the Directors was lifted from \u20ac877,000, unchanged since 2017, to  \u20ac1,400,000.  The  increase  reflects  the  larger  number  of Board members, the additional remuneration allocated to the Lead Independent Director, and the special portion allocated to the Sustainability Committee Chair.\n\nOut of the total amount set at the Annual General Meeting, the rule  followed  by  the  Board  in  order  to  comply  with  the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendation for a significant variable component  with  respect  to  remuneration  awarded  to Directors is to divide the total amount into a 40% fixed portion and a 60% variable portion. The remuneration is thus allocated\n\nin  the  following  manner  (Financi\u00e8re  Pinault  has  waived  all remuneration in respect of its duties as a Director):\n\n- \u00b7 a fixed portion, minus (i) a special portion corresponding to the remuneration of the Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration, Appointments and Governance, and Sustainability Committees, respectively (\u20ac23,000 each), (ii) a special portion corresponding to the remuneration of the Committee Vice-Chair (\u20ac11,500), and (iii) a special portion allocated to the Lead Independent Director  for  her  role  on  the  Board  (\u20ac75,000  for  2021),  the balance  being  allocated  with  a  coefficient  of  1  by  Board membership, increased by 0.5 per Committee;\n- \u00b7 a  variable  portion,  allocated  with  a  coefficient  of  1  per presence  at  each  meeting  of  the  Board  and  0.5  for  each attendance of a Committee meeting.\n\nFor  2021,  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac1,400,000  will  be  paid  to  the Directors, allocated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac560,000  for  the  fixed  portion,  of  which  \u20ac80,500  for  the special  portion  for  the  Chairs  of  the  Audit,  Remuneration and Sustainability Committees and for the Vice-Chair of the Audit  Committee,  and  \u20ac75,000  for  the  special  portion allocated  to  the  Lead  Independent  Director  (40%  of  the total remuneration awarded to Directors);\n- \u00b7 \u20ac840,000  for  the  variable  portion  (60%  of  the  total remuneration awarded to Directors).\n\nCorporate Board member (and controlling company) Financi\u00e8re Pinault has waived all remuneration in respect of its duties as a Director or Committee member within the Group.\n\n## Draft resolution regarding the remuneration paid during or awarded for 2021 to corporate officers\n\nEighth resolution: Approval of the information referred to in Article L. 22-10-9, I of the French Commercial Code relating to remuneration paid during or awarded for the year ended December 31, 2021 to corporate officers\n\nDeliberating  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of  quorum  and majority  applicable  to  ordinary  general  meetings  and  in application  of  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  22-10-34,  I  of  the French Commercial Code, the Annual General Meeting, having reviewed the Board of Directors' report on corporate governance,\n\napproves the information referred to in Article L. 22-10-9, I of the French Commercial Code relating to the remuneration and benefits  in  kind  paid  during  or  awarded  for  the  year  ended December  31,  2021  to  corporate  officers  in  respect  of  their duties as Directors, as described in the aforementioned report, which is included in the 2021 Universal Registration Document, Chapter  3  'Report  on  corporate  governance',  section  4.3 'Report on the remuneration paid during or awarded for 2021 to corporate officers in respect of their duties ( ex-post vote)'.\n\nThe Board of Directors.",

Since 2013, this approach has allowed Kering to identify the key challenges matching its vision and its activities (based on their  economic,  environmental  and  social  impacts),  and  also to  grasp  the  related  governance  issues  and  the  assessment made by the Group's key stakeholders.\n\n## 1. Identification of topics\n\n- \u00b7 Updating  of  the  mapping  of  topics  CSR, strategic, economic and operational -on the basis of an in-depth documentary review: international benchmarks (GRI, TCFD, SASB, IIRC, UN SDGs,  UN  GC,  etc.),  rating  agencies assessments, investor questions, Group news and press releases, major trends, internal surveys and studies\n- \u00b7 List of 28 topics on which stakeholders were consulted\n\n## 1.3.1.1 Materiality assessment methodology and stakeholder consultation procedure\n\nKering consulted its stakeholders around the world in 2020 in order  to  update  its  materiality  assessment,  first  published in  2014.  This  three-step  materiality  assessment  drew  on  the various existing guidelines for stakeholder  engagement (GRI,  AA1000,  ISO  26000).  A  steering  committee  made  up  of members from the Group's main functional departments was mobilized throughout the project, which was carried out with the support of a team of independent consultants.\n\n## 2. Stakeholder consultation and assessment of topics\n\n## 3. Ranking and consolidation of results\n\n- \u00b7 Quantitative  international  study  and strategic interviews of nearly 70 external stakeholders (investors, suppliers and business  partners,  distributors  and clients, civil society, local communities and NGOs, academics, public authorities and  regulators,  peers,  professional organizations  and  innovators)  and internal  stakeholders  (management, top  management  at  Kering  and  its Houses, functional departments)\n- \u00b7 Dual  assessment  of  each  topic:  by external  stakeholders  and  by  internal stakeholders\n- \u00b7 Dynamic assessment of developments affecting  the  various  topics  (i)  with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) after a period of ten years\n- \u00b7 Consolidation and analysis of results: equal  weighting  given  to  topics  and responses  from  different  groups  of stakeholders\n- \u00b7 Enrichment  of  quantitative  results with  data  from  strategic  interviews: confirmation of the preponderance of certain challenges - and notably their importance for Kering,  allowing  weak signals  and  emerging  topics  to  be examined in greater depth\n- \u00b7 Shedding light on the perceived impact of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the topics  and  major trends in the short, medium and long term\n- \u00b7 Sharing results",

Arranging these topics in a three-level hierarchy provides  useful  information  allowing  the  Group  to  better understand, manage and prioritize its actions in the short and medium term.\n\nThe results of the  assessment confirm that Kering's strategic pillars defined in the 2025 strategy and its business model, as well  as  the  commitments  made  since  2020,  are  consistent with  the  expectations  of  external  stakeholders.  Providing insight into the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020  stakeholder consultation indicates that the pandemic was an accelerating factor, bringing to the forefront topics  that  have  emerged  as  important  in  recent  years,\n\n## S T A KE H O L D ER EXP E C T A T I O N S\n\nespecially  biodiversity  and  climate  change,  and  driving  the need for faster action. Employee well-being also stands out as a strong focus for businesses in the context of the pandemic and  the  development  of  new  ways  of  working.  On  a  longerterm perspective, stakeholders identified four topics that are gaining  traction:  biodiversity,  sustainable  procurement  and responsible  supplier  relations,  employee  well-being,  and cybersecurity.\n\nThe  results  are  also  closely  linked  to  trends  impacting  the luxury goods market. Generations Y and Z, with their demand for  innovative  products  and  heightened  awareness  of  social and environmental issues, are driving the Group to accelerate its transformation and increase transparency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Transparency Living wages  in the supply chain Health and safety  in the supply chain                                                                                                               | Climate change   Biodiversity Inclusion and diversity Respect for human rights  in the supply chain   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                     | and fundamental freedoms                                                                              |\n| Sustainable packaging  and waste management Employee well-being Responsible advertising  and consumer awareness Sustainable procurement  and responsible supplier  relationships Business practices | Circular economy  and regeneration Sustainable sourcing of raw  materials and alternative  materials  |\n| Cra/f\\_tsmanship Talent attraction  and retention  Cybersecurity                                                                                                                                     | Customer satisfaction  and experience  Omni-channel approach  and digitalization                      |\n\n## IMPORTANCE FOR KERING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCore challenges\n\nMajor challenges\n\nCrucial challenges\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHigh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVery high\n\n<!-- image -->",

The approach  as  a  whole  and,  in  general,  all  aspects  relating  to risks, are presented in Chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nRisks relating to the categories included in the Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) as defined in Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code - environment, social/societal, human rights, corruption and tax evasion - are accordingly an integral  part  of  the  Group's  overall  risk  identification  and management process, and as such are described in Chapter 5 of this document. The Sustainability Department is involved in the  process  of  identifying  and  classifying  the  risks  that  fall within its scope.\n\nThis risk assessment extends beyond Kering's operations and covers  the  entire  value  chain  from  the  sourcing  of  raw materials to the use of products made by the Group's Houses, fully consistent with the materiality matrix, the recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD),  and  other  analytical  work conducted  by  Kering,  including  the  EP&L.  As  a  result,  nine principal risks out of the NFIS categories have been identified.\n\nThis convergent double approach - the analysis of risks that could challenge the Group's ability to maintain its performance, and the materiality analysis to identify the main issues in driving value creation and meeting the expectations of  internal  and  external  stakeholders  -  allows  the  clear identification of the Group's sustainability priorities.\n\nThe  policies  and  actions  implemented  within  the  Group,  the outcomes  obtained  and  the  related  performance  indicators are detailed in this NFIS.",

More specifically, while Kering can contribute directly or indirectly in variable proportions to each of the 17 SDGs, there are 12 SDGs for  which  it  can  have  a  more  significant  impact.  Kering published its first-ever Sustainability Progress Report in early 2020, providing a detailed update on the progress made. The table  below  shows  the  progress  made  to  the  end  of  2021 within each of the Strategy's pillars.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  department  implements  this  strategy  and  supports  the Houses by acting as a sounding board. More than 90  individuals  throughout  the  Group  have  a  dedicated sustainability  role,  working  for  the  Kering  Sustainability Department at the Corporate level, the Houses' Sustainability teams,  and  in  dedicated  structures  such  as  the  Materials Innovation Lab (MIL) and the Sustainable Innovation Lab (SIL). This organization encourages permanent cooperation between  the  Group  and  its  Houses,  with  support  for operational functions and for the creation of working parties and cross-business committees on the Group's commitments and flagship projects.\n\nIn terms of corporate governance, the Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors consisted of six Directors as  of  February  16,  2022  (Emma  Watson,  Committee  Chair;\n\nSophie L'H\u00e9lias; Daniela Riccardi; Jean-Pierre Denis; Fran\u00e7oisHenri Pinault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and JeanFran\u00e7ois Palus, Group Managing Director). It met on December 21,  2021  to  review  the  2025  objectives  and  discussed  the Group's  policies  and  outcomes  in  the  areas  of  climate, biodiversity,  human  rights,  animal  welfare  and  the  circular economy. Members also discussed the Group's ESG performance,  and  the  initiatives  needed  to  strengthen  the mechanisms  for  taking  climate  change  risks  into  account throughout  the  value  chain,  particularly  with  the  Group's suppliers.  A  progress  report  on  the  Kering  Foundation's actions to combat  violence  against  women  was  also presented. Lastly, a decision was taken in 2021 that will come into  effect  in  2022  to  appoint  a  member  of  the  Board  of Directors  as  climate  change  lead,  and  for  the  topic  to  be  on the Board's agenda twice a year.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, Kering held an ESG roadshow in 2021 to present the Group's approach to key investors. Held online  in  view  of  the  health  crisis,  it  was  organized  with  the assistance and presence of the Lead Independent Director.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, SNM meetings put particular emphasis on new business models, eliminating single-use plastics, sustainable finance, biodiversity, climate change and stakeholder involvement;\n- \u00b7 the two-day Sustainability Network Conference (SNC), open to attendees beyond sustainability teams, was held online in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It brought together more than 165 participants from all the Houses' sectors of activity,  and  heard  talks  by  Paul  Polman,  Chairman  of Fashion Pact, Federica Marchionni, Chair and CEO of Global Fashion  Agenda,  and  Cara  Smyth  from  the  Responsible Business Coalition. The work and discussions at SNC 2021 focused mainly on the definition of sustainable Luxury and the  need  to  engage  consumers  in  the  transition  of  the fashion and luxury industries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Informing and raising awareness among employees\n\nKering and its Houses are developing a suite of trainings and awareness-building  actions  on  sustainability  issues  and regularly  share  news  and  updates  on  sustainability  projects internally:\n\n- \u00b7 awareness-building  during  the  induction  process  for  all new employees at Kering and its Houses;\n- \u00b7 sharing  updates  and  news  on  the  Group's  and  Houses' sustainability  projects  via  the  Group's  corporate  social networks,  which  are  available  to  all  employees  and  on  all devices (computers, tablets, smartphones, etc.);\n- \u00b7 quarterly  challenges  on  The  Kering  Planet,  the  dedicated digital platform for employees;\n- \u00b7 involvement in targeted events organized by the Group and the Houses;\n- \u00b7 training for salespeople and employees with key roles, such as design, retail and merchandising, to inform them about the Group's sustainability actions, sustainable collections and to share best practice to ensure efficient store management;\n\n- \u00b7 inclusion of sustainability topics in the compulsory annual Ethics  &  Compliance  training  for  all  Group  employees around the world.\n\nSeparate to the remuneration of executive corporate officers (see Chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document), but in parallel, a growing number of Kering's subsidiaries incorporate  sustainability  in  the  pay-related  objectives  for their  employees  and  managers.  This  is  notably  the  case  at Brioni,  which  introduced  such  a  scheme  in  2021.  At  Bottega Veneta  all  employees  were  involved  in  a  participative approach to setting sustainability targets for their activities in 2021.  Employees  at  Kering  Eyewear  also  have  sustainabilityrelated objectives.",

Bringing  together  more  than  250  brands  representing  more than  one-third  of  production  volumes  in  the  fashion  and textile  industry,  the  Fashion  Pact  now  has  considerable European  and  international  influence,  establishing  itself  as\n\nthe leading CEO-led coalition for the sustainable transition of the  fashion  sector.  Its  actions,  split  between  the  three  key areas of Climate, Oceans and Biodiversity, represent concrete vectors  for  positive  impacts  for  the  Pact's  signatories.  They cover  a  range  of  subjects  including  renewable  energy, microplastics and microfibers leakage, regenerative agricultural  practice  in  sourcing  raw  materials,  and  tools  for calculating biodiversity footprints.\n\n## 1.6 Recognition and inclusion in SRI- ESG indices\n\nAs  an  extension  of  its  commitment  to  transparency,  each year  Kering  responds  to  or  is  included  in  more  than 60  solicitations,  questionnaires  and  requests  from  rating agencies,  NGOs  and  non-financial  assessment  bodies  on  its ESG performance (1) or  on specific issues (Good on You, CHRB, WDI,  etc.).

To  ensure  that  these  values permeate its operations and ceaselessly nurture a sustainable climate of trust and successful performance across the Group, Kering  is  firmly  committed  to  ethical  behavior  in  all  its activities  and  business  relationships.  Kering  is  fully  aware  of its  duty  to  adopt extensive ethical responsibilities and to act at  Group  and  House  level,  and  with  its  suppliers  and  other business  partners,  in  such  a  way  as  to  promote  the  highest ethical  standards  in  all  circumstances,  and  to  resolutely identify  and  effectively  handle  any  situation  likely  to  involve risk in terms of ethics or respect for human rights.\n\nThis  firm  commitment  starts  at  the  top,  with  Executive Management and the Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors.  To  ensure  this  commitment  is  actively  taken  up throughout the Group and its Houses, Kering draws upon its Code  of  Ethics,  the  key  document  setting  out  the  principles behind the Group's internal and external actions, and upon a compliance  program  with  a  dedicated  organization  tasked with  developing  and  overseeing  implementation,  led  by  the Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer,  who  reports  directly  to  the Group Audit Committee.\n\nThis is tightly integrated into Kering's internal control system, ensuring effective propagation of a strong culture of integrity throughout  the  Group  and  its  Houses,  and  providing  all employees  with  a  solid  framework  for  action  along  with  all necessary resources and support to clarify any ethics issues. It also enables employees to confidentially report any potential violations, and ensures the prompt and fair treatment of any such  reports.  It  ensures  that  the  Group  complies  with applicable  regulatory  requirements,  including  French  laws no. 2016-1691, known as 'Sapin II', and no. 2017-399 on the Duty of Care.\n\n## Organization of ethics and compliance within the Group\n\nThe Group's ethics organization is  coordinated  and  overseen by  the  Kering  Executive  Committee,  under  the  guidance  of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, Kering's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, see section 1.5.\n\nInitially consisting of a single body (the Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee - ECSRC, set up in 2005), the ethics organization has since late 2013 drawn on the work of three  Ethics  Committees:  a  Group  Committee  and  two\n\nRegional  Committees  (Asia-Pacific  and  the  Americas).  This dovetails  with  the  Group's  policy  of  delegating  responsibility bodies exist to act effectively in the light of actual operating conditions,  within  a  shared  reference  framework  applied throughout the Group. Each of the three Committees is made up of representatives from Kering and the Group's Houses to ensure greater diversity (nationality, gender, position occupied).  In  2021,  women  accounted  for  60%  of  the members  of  these  committees.  These  Committees  focus  on three main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 to ensure that the Code of Ethics is up to date and that it effectively reaches all Group employees;\n- \u00b7 to generate proposals on appropriate updates to the Code and  on  the  implementation  of  appropriate  behavior  and practices;\n- \u00b7 to process ethics issues reported by Group employees and, since  January  1,  2018,  by  external  and  temporary  staff working  for  external  partners  or  service  providers  under contract  with  the  Group  and/or  its  Houses.  Issues  may  be reported directly or by means of an ethics hotline. Kering's ethics  whistleblowing  system  is  described  below  in  the section  entitled  'Whistleblowing  procedure  for  reporting unethical conduct'.\n\nEmployees  can  also  call  on  the  Ethics  Committee  of  their choice  to  request  clarification  or  ask  questions  on  the interpretation of the Code, if they are unsure how to behave in a specific situation.\n\nThe  Compliance  structure,  which  was  put  in  place  in  2015, is  coordinated  by  a  Group  Chief  Compliance Officer  (CCO), responsible for implementing the Group Compliance Program as approved by the Board of Directors. Appointed in 2015 by Kering's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief Compliance  Officer  reports  to  the  Audit  Committee,  an important  factor  given  the  independence  required  of  this function,  and  has  direct  access  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer. The Group Chief Compliance Officer does not hold  any  other  position,  and  is  thus  fully  dedicated  to  this function.\n\nTo ensure the day-to-day monitoring and effectiveness of the Compliance  Program,  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  is supported by (i) a team of five compliance law experts working out of Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo, (ii) a network of Brand Compliance Officers appointed by the House CEOs, and (iii)  a  network  of  Regional  and  Local  Compliance  Officers.  In some Houses, there are compliance managers in addition to the Brand and Local Compliance Officers.\n\nAs  a  general  rule,  the  positions  held  by  the Compliance Officers in parallel with their compliance duties are sufficiently high-ranking to ensure they have the necessary authority and independence.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2 Implementation throughout the Group and beyond\n\n## Kering's Code of Ethics\n\nSet out since 1996 in the Group's first Ethics Charter, Kering's ethical  principles  apply  to  everyone  within  the  Group  and reflect  the  Group's  strong  convictions  about  responsible business practices. Kering's Code of Ethics was first introduced in 2005, and underwent major updates in 2009 and 2013. The latest  update,  in  2018,  was  issued  to  all  employees  in  2019.  To ensure the fullest possible employee understanding and takeup of Kering's values and ethical standards, the new version of the Code, reissued in 2019, is now available in 14 languages, compared  with  9  up  until  2018.  The  latest  update  focused chiefly  on  strengthening  commitments  regarding  personnel and  the  behavior  expected  of  everyone,  and  on  Group measures and policies  brought  in  following  the  introduction of  new  legislation  and  regulations,  such  as  France's  Sapin  II law. The Suppliers' Charter included in the Code of Ethics was updated  at  the  same  time,  with  particular  regard  to  the question of human rights. In addition, the Code of Ethics now extends  to  the  commitments  of  members  of  the  Executive Committee as well as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and, for the first time, was presented to and reviewed by the Kering Board of Directors.\n\nThe Code clearly sets out the ethical principles that should be applied  everywhere  and  by  everyone,  as  well  as  the  Group's values, what it believes in and what it does not tolerate.\n\nIt aims to comply with the major international reference texts (United  Nations  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights, European Convention on Human Rights, the main conventions of the International Labour Organization, OECD Guidelines for Multinational  Enterprises,  United  Nations  Convention  on  the Rights  of  the  Child,  United  Nations  Global  Compact)  and demonstrates  how  the  Group  continually  strengthens  its commitments and the systems in place to ensure compliance. Sustainability  for  Kering  is  not  possible  without  the  Code  of Ethics, which is used as the sole set of standards implemented by  all  throughout  the  Group,  regardless  of  their  level  of responsibility, position or location.\n\nThe Code of Ethics is available on the Group's intranet, and on Kering's website for readers outside the Group.\n\n## System for detecting and preventing corruption and influence-peddling\n\nKering's  Code  of  Ethics  emphasizes  the  fact  that  employees must  at  all  times  act  with  integrity,  loyalty  and  a  sense  of responsibility.  It  clearly  sets  out  the  Group's  commitment  to zero  tolerance  on  corruption  and  influence-peddling,  and encourages employees to report any instance of corruption. It stipulates  the  necessity  of  avoiding  conflicts  of  interest,  any risk of which must be promptly identified and resolved.\n\nTo apply these commitments in an effective way and ensure full compliance with the stipulations of France's Sapin II law, a\n\nmap  of  corruption  risks  was  drawn  up  in  2017  under  the supervision of the Group Chief Compliance Officer. The Group Chief Compliance Officer submitted the risk map analysis and ensuing action plans to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors at the meeting held on June 7, 2017.\n\nAs  detailed  in  the  section  on  'Fraud  and  corruption  risks'  in Chapter  5,  a  new  in-depth  assessment  of  corruption  and influence-peddling risks was undertaken across the Group and each of its Houses worldwide in 2019. To ensure that the risk assessment  was  comprehensive,  each  potential  corruption and  influence-peddling  scenario  relevant  to  the  Group  was identified and assessed after analyzing existing first-, secondand  third-level controls. The resulting corruption and influence-peddling risks with these scenarios were rated and ranked  in  a  risk  map.  Implementation  of  the  action  plan adopted  following  the  risk  mapping  exercise  took  place in 2021. The update to the corruption and influence-peddling risk map was completed during 2021. Second-level compliance audits  to  ensure  the  proper  implementation  of  the  compliance program  and  detect  corruption  and  influence-peddling  risks are  carried  out  on  and  off  site  by  the  Group  Compliance Department, with the support of an international law firm to reinforce  the  independence  and  expertise  of  the  analysis  in the most at-risk jurisdictions identified in the risk map.\n\n## Steering\n\nIn 2016, Kering brought in an anti-corruption policy, standing side by side with the Code of Ethics to offer employees fuller guidance in their everyday practices and ensure tight control over  risks  of  corruption.  This  policy,  which  was  updated  in October  2019  under  an  action  plan  drawn  up  as  a  result  of the 2019 risk map , identifies prohibited behavior and sets out guidelines enabling employees to detect instances of corruption and report them to management. The Group Chief Compliance Officer, who  reports  directly  to  the  Audit  Committee, independently  of  the  Houses  and  support  functions,  is responsible for implementing the anti-corruption policy under the  Group's  overall  Compliance  Program.  The  deployment  of the  anti-corruption  policy  is  monitored  closely  by  the  Audit Committee and Executive Management.\n\nThe  policy  extends  to  specific  procedures  on  the  following subjects:\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on gifts, hospitality and entertainment\n\nThe procedure on gifts, hospitality and entertainment sets out rules  on  giving  and  receiving  gifts  and  invitations  to  Group events.\n\nPrior  written  authorization  from  the  relevant  Compliance Officer  is  required  whenever  a  gift  or  invitation  involves  a public official or is of significant value.\n\nThe  procedure  on  gifts,  hospitality  and  entertainment  was updated in October 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  degree  of  due  diligence  required depends  on  the  objective  risk  profile  of  the  third  party  in question and any specific risks that may have been identified during the assessment. In certain cases, compliance questionnaires  are  sent  to  the  third  parties  concerned requesting  additional  information  for  the  purpose  of  closer diligence.\n\nTo assist the Compliance Officers and other Group employees called  upon  to  assess  third  parties  under  this  procedure, Kering works with a service provider specializing in third-party due diligence.\n\n## \u00b7 Prior verification procedure on the prevention of corruption in merger and acquisition operations\n\nThe  prior  verification  procedure  on  the  prevention  of corruption in merger and acquisition operations, introduced in October 2016, requires a prior evaluation of the third parties concerned by the transaction. As is the case for the procedure on third-party due diligence, this procedure specifies different degrees  of  diligence,  matched  to  the  compliance  risks identified.\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on donations and sponsorship\n\nUnder a specific Group procedure, all donations and sponsorships granted by the Group to third-party persons or organizations require  prior  written  approval  from  the  relevant  Compliance Officer. The procedure was updated in October 2019.\n\nSince  August  22,  2017,  the  Group  has  been  listed  on  the register  of  the  French  government's Haute  Autorit\u00e9  pour  la Transparence de la Vie Publique, and  complies  with  all  ethics requirements stipulated by French law on the matter.\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on conflicts of interest\n\nIn 2016, Kering brought in a specific procedure on conflicts of interest, which requires employees to report any connections, relationships  or  other  situations  giving  rise  or  that  may potentially  give  rise  to  a  conflict  of  interest  by  signing  a specific  declaration  and  discussing  the  situation  with  their managers.  A  campaign  is  launched  each  year  to  collect declarations of conflicts of interests across a target population of employees.\n\nSeveral  procedures,  including  that  on  the  involvement  of suppliers in the production chain, refer to this procedure and invite employees involved in decision-making processes with regard  to  third  parties  to  report  any  potential  conflicts  of interest.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nIn addition to the anti-corruption policy and related procedures, the  Group  Compliance  Department  also  provides  additional advice to Compliance Officers and Group employees through the regular issue of guidelines on specific compliance matters.\n\nSpecific guidelines issued so far cover: interaction with public officials,  third-party  due  diligence,  discounts  granted  to certain  business  partners,  discounts  granted  to  employees, real  estate  transactions,  consignment, human resources, and analysis of gifts, hospitality, donations and sponsorship, etc.\n\n## System for detecting and preventing money laundering\n\nIn accordance with its targets in Social Responsibility, in 2021 Kering  adopted  and  implemented  a  Group  Policy  (the  'AML Policy')  to  reduce  money-laundering  risks  and  strengthen  its systems  in  this  area.  This  policy  sets  rules  of  conduct  for checks relating to sales by the Houses, on-line and in store. To do  so,  the  AML  Policy  establishes  rules  for  transactions considered  as  at-risk,  together  with  specific  rules  in  each country where Houses have sales activities. These have been listed in dedicated country data sheets in order to assist their implementation  by  Group  sales  employees.  The  Kering Compliance  Department  has  already  trained  more  than 2,000  employees  worldwide  in  the  application  of  the  AML Policy.\n\n## Whistleblowing procedure for reporting unethical conduct\n\nIntroduced  in  2005,  Kering's  whistleblowing  system  was strengthened in 2018 to ensure full compliance with France's Sapin  II  law.  It  is  accessible  to  all  people  working  for  the Group:  employees  and  interns  of  the  Group  and  its  Houses, and  external  and  temporary  personnel  working  for  external partners  or  service  providers  under  contract  with  the  Group and/or its Houses.\n\nAll employees may use the system to submit reports via their direct or indirect manager or employer, the Human Resources Department, the Group Chief Compliance Officer, the Compliance  Officer  network  or  the  Ethics  Committee.  It  may be used to report any of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 a criminal offense;\n- \u00b7 a serious violation of a law or regulation;\n- \u00b7 conduct or a situation contrary to the Group's Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 a threat or serious harm to the general interest.\n\nReports  are  transferred  for  processing  by  the  ethics  or compliance organization via authorized contact persons who ensure  the  confidentiality  and  security  of  the  information transferred.  The  contact  persons  are  also  responsible  for verifying the facts reported.\n\nWhen a report is submitted, one of the Ethics Committees or the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  will  contact  the  person reporting  the  matter  to  request  permission  to  contact  the House  concerned,  specifying  that  the  person's  identity  will remain  confidential  and  that  every  effort  will  be  made  to investigate  the  issue  within  three  months  at  most.  Kering  is committed  to  protecting whistleblowers, and explicitly prohibits  any  form  of  reprisal  in  its  ethics  policies  and procedures.  This  protection  is  clearly  stated  in  the  annual e-learning module on the Code of Ethics.",

        "page_content": "## 2.3 Promoting and respecting ethics within the Group and beyond\n\n## Fostering a culture of integrity\n\nA  training  program  on  ethics  and  the  related  Code  was established for all Group employees worldwide and has been implemented throughout Kering since 2014.\n\nAvailable in 15 languages, it sets out the ethical ground rules in  place  at  Kering,  and  presents  case  studies  and  ethical dilemmas  that  help  employees  ask  themselves  the  right questions. It is updated annually, and covers all the principles upheld by the Group's Code of Ethics by alternating between practical  examples  that  allow  a  variety  of  subjects  to  be covered over time (conflicts of interest, inclusion and diversity, respect for human  rights, harassment, environmental protection,  fraud,  etc.)  with  tackling  corruption  being  an obligatory topic each year. In 2020, the training was enhanced for the first time by the inclusion of a module on the impact of domestic violence in the workplace, to raise awareness on the best ways to react and support victims of such violence. As in previous years, employees were reminded of the existence and operation  of  the  Group's  whistleblowing  system  and  its  key features  (notably  the  respect  for  confidentiality  in  the treatment  of  cases  and  the  ban  on  any  reprisals  against whistleblowers).\n\nLastly, each year the launch of the annual training campaign is headed  by  Kering's  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  in the  form  of  a  direct  video  address  to  all  Group  employees, highlighting  the  importance  to  the  Group  of  a  culture  of integrity in the conduct of its business and in the day-to-day roles and responsibilities of all employees.\n\nIn  2017, the Group launched a 45-minute e-learning module on anti-corruption,  addressing  all  employees.  To  ensure  the widest  possible  reach,  the  module  is  available  in  nine languages.  It  seeks  to  provide  employees  with  a  full  view  of the  subject,  from  (i)  typical  corruption-prone  situations, (ii) applicable anti-corruption regulations, and (iii) appropriate behavior with regard to gifts and hospitality, to (iv) appropriate reactions  to  facilitation  payments,  and  (v)  working  with business partners.\n\nFor greater clarity and efficiency, decision was made in 2019 to merge the Ethics and Compliance modules in order to offer all employees a unified Ethics & Compliance training module. The  Ethics  &  Compliance  training  program  reached  96.4%  of Kering employees worldwide in 2021, compared with 95.1% in 2020 and 94.4% in 2019.\n\nKering's Compliance Officers benefit from regular personalized training,  and the Group's internal auditors have been trained on  the  key  factors  involved  in  assessing  anti-corruption procedures.  On-site  training  courses  are  also  run  to  educate Group employees on corruption risks. The Kering Compliance Department  trained  more  than  1,700  employees  worldwide in 2021.\n\nAs  well  as  providing  training,  Kering  also  runs  an  ongoing program  of  information  and  awareness-raising  on  ethics, addressing  employees  and  managers.  All  new  recruits  are systematically  issued  with  a  copy  of  the  Code  of  Ethics,  and are  required  to  follow  the  ethics  training  program  for  the current year. This sets a sound basis for a culture of ethics and integrity from each employee's earliest days with Kering.\n\nThe Group's intranet includes an Ethics & Compliance section in  French  and  English,  giving  ready  access  to  policies  and procedures, along with a list of  compliance managers at the Houses and structures.\n\n## Relationships with business partners\n\nSince  2013,  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics  has  included  the  Group Suppliers'  Charter,  which  sets  out  in  detail  Kering's  specific expectations  of  its  business  partners  on  ethics,  social  and environmental issues.\n\nFor  any  contractor  working  for  Kering  or  one  of  its  Houses, notwithstanding any contractual clauses, compliance with the Charter  is  a  precondition  of  the  business  relationship.  The Group  requires  its  suppliers  to  commit  formally  to  applying high  ethical  standards  themselves  and  to  ensuring  the preservation of human rights.\n\nFollowing the French Sapin II law, the Group's whistleblowing system  was  also  opened  to  employees  of  the  suppliers  and service providers with which Kering and its Houses have direct business  relationships.  All  suppliers  and  service  providers were  informed  accordingly.  In  2020,  Kering  decided  to  go  a step  further,  by  organizing  a  Group-wide  communication campaign to reach the employees concerned directly.\n\nA plan for reaching the employees of direct suppliers to Kering and  its  Houses  was  therefore  drawn  up  and  rolled  out in 2020. Translated into 15 languages, the campaign took two forms:  a  poster  to  be  displayed  in  relevant  locations  at supplier  and  service  provider  sites,  in  order  to  gain  the greatest visibility (cafeteria, locker rooms, site entrance, etc.), and a flyer to be given directly to employees. Both the poster and the flyer listed the six key ethical principles: compliance with  laws  and  regulations;  prohibition  of  any  form  of corruption,  fraud,  money  laundering  or  conflict  of  interest; respect for human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms; protection  of  the  health  and  safety  of  all;  respect  for  the integrity and dignity of all; and protection of the environment. The  level  of  detail  used  in  the  communication  was  adapted depending on the recipients to give specific examples of what was expected in each case (including in particular the refusal of  forced  labor,  the  refusal  of  recruitment  fees  paid  by employees,  special  attention  paid  to  vulnerable  persons, access  to  suitable  washroom  facilities  and  to  decent dormitory conditions, where applicable, the availability of pay and  personal  documentation,  respect  for  privacy,  access  to appropriate personal protective equipment, etc.).\n\nAs well as setting out the key points requiring compliance at all locations, both documents also reminded employees of the whistleblowing system and how to use it.\n\nLastly, to provide all employees, depending on their locations and  profiles,  with  access  to  documentation  in  their  own language(s),  an  internet  platform  was  developed  allowing them  to  download  documents  in  any  of  the  15  languages available.  An  email  information  campaign  targeting  the employees was also organized by the Group Ethics Committee, with full backing from the CEOs of all the Group's Houses. This information  and  communication  campaign  will  be  renewed each year, to cover all new suppliers and service providers of the Group and its Houses. This information and communication campaign will be renewed each year, to cover all  new  suppliers  and  service  providers  of  the  Group  and  its Houses.  Thus  in  2021,  a  second  campaign  was  conducted covering all suppliers enlisted since the first campaign, along with suppliers of the Group's indirect purchases. The supplier social  audits  conducted  each  year  include  checks  on  the effective  circulation  of  this  information  to  all  employees (awareness  of  the  system,  display and  issue of the documentation, etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  assessment  is  part  of  the  Hercules compliance  management  system  applicable  to  Kering's suppliers of non-retail goods.  Supplier  qualification  is conditional on positive findings in the audits on ethical, social and environmental aspects carried out by Kering supply chain audit  and  supply  chain  security  teams.  After  qualification, suppliers'  continued  compliance  with  Kering  requirements  is verified by follow-up audits.\n\nAudit  findings  are  centralized  in  a  dedicated  database,  to which all Houses have access.\n\nSee section 4 'Building together environmentally and socially responsible supply chains' for details of the Group Suppliers' Charter and the conditions for the application of Sustainability principles  in  supply  chains,  and  the  findings  of  audits  and assessments carried out in 2021.\n\n## 2.4 Impact of policies and initiatives\n\n## Claims addressed to the Ethics Committees\n\nIn  2021,  Kering's  three  Ethics  Committees handled a total of 82 requests, including 75 complaints and 7 inquiries (questions, requests for clarification).

Investigations into the other 56 cases did not reveal  an  infringement  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  but  highlighted areas for improvement in management or communication for example.  As  a  result,  32%  of  cases  considered  resulted  in recommendations for operational improvements being issued by the investigating Committee.\n\n## 2.5 Protection of human rights\n\n## Focus on: Kering's Human Rights Policy\n\nThe publication in 2021 of a Human Rights Policy, covering all of Kering's operations as well as its supply chain, not only allowed the expression of certain undertakings formalized in the Code of Ethics and Suppliers' Charter, but also resulted in the updating of a key document for our suppliers, the Sustainability Principles. This process was accompanied by revisions to the social questionnaire on the vendor portal for suppliers, in order to clarify items or add new elements (for example reporting structures, the refusal of recruitment fees paid by employees, and community benefit initiatives) enabling them to conduct a self-assessment in the area.\n\n## 2.5.1 An approach rooted in the Group's values: founding principles and general framework\n\nRespect  for  and  protection  of  human  rights,  for  all  Group employees  and  all  employees  in  the  supply  chains  of  its various Houses, is central to Kering's ethical commitments at all times.\n\nThe global health crisis confirmed the importance of putting into place solid measures and processes to ensure respect for human rights in our operations and our supply chain. During this  period,  we  have  worked  with  our  business  partners  to ensure among other things that their employees are provided with  appropriate  means  of  protection  and  to  mitigate  the\n\nnegative impact of the health crisis on their economic activity to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThe Group's ethical approach to business and overall behavior forms a consistent and central component of its identity and development.  This  includes  the  principles  set  out  in  the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization, and the United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human Rights.\n\nThis commitment to respect human rights throughout the Group and its supply chains is reflected in and expanded upon in its key reference documents as shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese  policies  and  documents  work  together  to  define  the Group's human rights strategy. More specifically, the Code of Ethics  draws  on  the  Group's  key  founding  principles  in  the area  of  ethics,  which  are  then  expressed  in  greater  detail  in other policies and documents. The contents of these policies and systems are set out in the relevant sections of this NFIS; they  may  be  complemented  by  each  House's  individual  or sector-specific initiatives, as set out in section 2.5.2.6 below.\n\nKering's  approach  to  the  protection  of  human  rights  may  be accessed  on  the  Kering  website,  which  also  carries  its declarations  under  the  California  Transparency  in  Supply Chains  Act  of  2010,  the  UK  Modern  Slavery  Act  2015,  the Australian  Modern  Slavery  Act  2018  and  Regulation  (EU) 2017/821  of  May  17,  2017  on  metals  and  ores  from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. In addition, Kering's Duty of  Care  plan,  drawn  up  in  compliance  with  French  Law no.  2017-399  of  March  27,  2017  on  the  Duty  of  Care,  is outlined  in  the  'Duty  of  care  plan'  section  Chapter  5  of  this document.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that ethics reporting and key figures are  shared  with  the  Group's  Top  Management  and  the Sustainability  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  all information having previously been anonymized and stripped of personal information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These principles, now set out in Kering's Code of Ethics,  are  regularly  updated  to  bring  clarifications  and explanations  resulting  from  the  continuous  improvement process.\n\nIn  the  same  vein,  the  due  diligence  procedure  aimed  at identifying,  assessing  and  preventing  the  impact  that  Group operations have or might have on human rights in the supply chain is seen as a continuous process with a need for constant adaptation. This procedure is included in the Hercules system, which is described in section 4.1.3.\n\nAs  outlined  in  the  'Duty  of  care  plan',  in  2017  the  Group carried  out  a  risk  mapping  procedure  covering  Kering's operations and its supply chains. In 2021, Kering conducted a new,  more  in-depth  evaluation  of  risks  pertaining  to  severe impacts on human rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety, and the environment resulting from its operations and its supply chains.\n\nFollowing on from these initiatives, additional work has been carried out to identify areas for improvement, with a particular focus  on  respect  for  human  rights  throughout  the  supply chain.  A  gap  analysis  was  performed  in  2017  to  pinpoint differences  between  the  Group's  internal  practices  and  the UNGP. The findings of this analysis provided input for the 2019 update  to  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics  and  for  a  dedicated communication plan targeting employees of the Group's direct suppliers with specific details on how to use the whistleblowing system. The first phase of this communication campaign  took  place  in  2020,  followed  by  a  campaign  of updates in 2021. It will continue to be monitored on a regular basis to ensure it reaches all new direct suppliers.\n\n- A  detailed  description  of  the  communication  plan  for suppliers is given in section 2.3.\n\nKeen  to  refine  its  understanding  of  human  rights  issues throughout the supply chain, and to learn from good practices on  the  matter,  in  2020  Kering  carried  out  a  new  study focusing on the governance and management of human rights within the supply chain, at Group and House level. Carried out with GoodCorporation, an independent organization specializing in  business  ethics,  this  study  included  consultations  with various internal stakeholders in order to gather their feedback. To  identify  new  avenues  for  progress,  the  findings  from  the study  were  analyzed  in  the  light  of  the  recommendations given  in  the  UNGP  and  the  OECD  Due  Diligence  Guidance  for Responsible  Supply  Chains  in  the  Garment  and  Footwear Sector. Kering also conducted a study aiming to identify and assess human rights risks linked to the supply of certain key raw materials. This analysis factored in aspects regarding the countries  from  which  suppliers  operate.  The  findings  from\n\nthese various studies enabled the Group to identify a number of key points and subjects, and the resulting recommendations were shared with members of the Executive Committee.\n\nThis analysis has enabled Kering to update the list of risks that the  Group  considers  salient  with  regard  to  human  rights (notably  forced  labor,  child  labor  in  raw  materials  sourcing, discrimination,  health  and  safety,  living  wages  for  suppliers' employees, harassment).\n\nThe importance of respect for human rights was confirmed by the  materiality  assessment  carried  out  by  the  Group  that identified respect for human rights as a strategic challenge of particular  importance  and  hence  central  to  discussions  on preparation  of  its  2025  Strategy,  consistent  with  the  United Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  The  consultation conducted in 2020 confirmed that respect for human rights is among the crucial challenges facing the Group, as set out in section 1.4.\n\nThe  non-financial  risk  'Human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms' was identified in the Group's overall risk analysis, as presented in Chapter 5 of this document.\n\nThe following sections detail how Kering monitors progress on these  major  challenges  and  effectively  implements  the principles  set  out  above,  for  its  own  operations  and  in  its supply chains.\n\n## 2.5.2.2 Ambitions incorporated into the Group's 2025 Sustainability Strategy\n\nIn 2017, Kering published its 2025 Sustainability Strategy. The strategy  rests  on  three  pillars,  two  of  which  include  human rights objectives. The Care pillar commits Kering to achieving 100% implementation by suppliers of the strict requirements set in the Kering Standards for raw materials and manufacturing processes by 2025. These include standards on traceability,  animal  welfare,  use  of  chemicals,  environmental impact and social impact.\n\nThough  the  Collaborate  pillar  on  Kering's  strategic  social commitment  is  not  exclusively  about  human  rights,  it  does include these six related points:\n\n- \u00b7 support  the  continuation  of  craftsmanship  traditions  and the communities that support them;\n- \u00b7 extend  focus  across  the  supply  chain  and  improve community livelihoods where raw materials are sourced;\n- \u00b7 amplify  forward-thinking  employment  practices,  including the global parental policy, a well-being at work policy, and an employee benefits policy;\n- \u00b7 promote  an  inclusive  work  environment,  ensure  salary equity  in  all  functions  and  achieve  gender  parity  at  all levels;\n- \u00b7 develop innovative career paths for all;\n- \u00b7 aim to be the preferred employer in the luxury sector.",

        "page_content": "## 2.5.2.3 Shared governance and central systems rolled out at Group level\n\nKering takes a cross-functional approach to governance over human rights challenges, integrated into its overall governance structure  for  sustainability,  as  set  out  in  section  1.5. Specifically, human rights governance spans various departments,  starting  with  Compliance,  Human  Resources (and its Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Department), Sustainability,  Internal  Audit  and  Security.  It  also  extends  to employee representative bodies.\n\nFor many years now, Kering's commitments on human rights have also been expressed through the Kering Foundation. The Foundation,  formed  in  2008,  combats  violence  against women. It commits Kering to a key issue that ties in with its Houses'  activities  and  clients,  and  an  area  where  the  Group has  a  vital  role  to  play  alongside  governments  and  NGOs. In  2019,  the  Foundation  took  part  in  the  first  'Grenelle' summit on the prevention of domestic violence, organized by the French Secretary of State responsible for gender equality and combatting discrimination.\n\nHuman rights considerations are also included in the annual performance  evaluations  of  Group  executives.  30%  of  the variable  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer  and  of  the  Group  Managing  Director  is  linked  to  the fulfillment of non-financial criteria, including the operational roll-out of the 2025 Sustainability Strategy.\n\nLastly,  a  vendor  portal  has  been  created  to  help  optimize communication between Kering and its suppliers. It provides suppliers  with  ready  access  to  training  and  key  Kering documents - including on human rights - but also to allow for greater  transparency  on  supply  chains.  Via  this  portal, suppliers are required to complete three annual questionnaires (on the implementation of the Kering Standards, environmental management,  and  labor  relations  management),  the  input from  which  will  be  used  for  evaluating  their  practices.  The labor relations questionnaire, which will contain 97 questions in 2022, seeks increased transparency on the composition of the  supplier's  workforce  (gender  balance,  for  example),  on specific initiatives taken  on  the  matter,  and  on  their management of health and safety (risk  assessment,  incident rate,  etc.),  and  on  measures  for  mitigating  risks  concerning forced labor and child labor. Introduced in 2020, this platform allowed  initial  assessment  of  suppliers  in  2021.  For  more detail on this system and the results, please see section 4.2.2.\n\n## 2.5.2.4 Employee training and education\n\nConscious  of  the  importance  of  raising  awareness  within  its workforce, Kering has put in place multiple training activities, some of which include various aspects of human rights.\n\n- \u00b7 All  Group  employees  take  a  compulsory  annual  Ethics  & Compliance  course  based  on  the  principles  set  out  in Kering's  Code  of  Ethics.  The  course  is  available  in  the 15  most  widely  spoken  languages  within  the  Group.  The situations and subjects covered vary from year to year, with the  common  objective  of  ensuring  that  employees  will adopt  appropriate  behavior  when  faced  with  the  ethics dilemmas  they  might  come  across  in  their  everyday working experience. In 2021 the course covered biodiversity and animal welfare, with a sharp focus on the importance and  impact  of  responsible  supply  chains.  This  e-learning module  also  provided  the  opportunity  to  remind  all employees  of  the  new  human  rights  policy  adopted in  2021.  A  detailed  description  of  the  training  program  is provided in section 2.3.\n- \u00b7 Training on the Kering Standards, for employees of Kering and its Houses, and their suppliers, was published via the Group's  internal  website  in  2018.  This  seeks  to  explain Kering's minimum requirements on sourcing and processes whilst  providing  illustrations  and  details,  notably  social, that  provide  context  for  why  the  standards  are  necessary. See section 4.2.1.4.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, the topic of human rights and their integration in sustainability  strategy  was  discussed  at  the  Sustainability Network Conference (SNC), a one-day meeting of dedicated sustainability  teams  alongside  representatives  from  other departments.\n- \u00b7 Several  times  a  year,  the  Kering  Foundation  runs  training courses  for  employees  of  Kering  and  its  Houses  on  the issue  of  domestic  violence.  These  courses  cover  the complexity  and  impact  of  domestic  violence,  and  provide insights  into  ways  to  develop  a  safe  work  environment. In 2020, a dedicated module was also included in the Ethics and  Compliance  training  course.  A  detailed  description  of the Foundation's work is given in section 5.4.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This social certification, based on internationally recognized employment standards, is designed to demonstrate companies' adherence to the highest employment standards. Gucci  is  also  actively  involved  with  Social  Accountability International (SAI), which developed the SA8000 standard, and is a member of SAI's Advisory Board.\n\nSeveral  of  the  Group's  main  Jewelry  Houses  have  joined  the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), an international organization aiming  to  establish  responsible  and  transparent  business practices in the precious metals trade. RJC certification attests to  a  company's  ethics,  respect  for  the  environment  and working  conditions  in  the  jewelry  and  watchmaking  sectors. Pomellato  and  DoDo,  Boucheron  and  Gucci  (also  RJC CoC-certified) are RJC-certified. The certification processes at Ulysse  Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux  were  suspended  in  2021 due to the health crisis, and are due to be restarted in 2022.\n\nIn addition to certification, the Houses also develop many of their own programs on respect for human rights. 2021 provided several Houses the opportunity to continue their commitment to and involvement in several projects including:\n\n- \u00b7 Kering gender equality project (Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Pomellato and Kering Eyewear): following research into  the  role  of  women  in  supply  chains  for  the  Italian luxury  sector,  training  addressing  questions  such  as increasing  women's  autonomy  at  work  and  the  work-life balance  continued  to  be  provided  to  Houses'  suppliers in 2021. See section 4.2.2;\n- \u00b7 I  was a Sari: a collaboration between Gucci and the Indian social  enterprise  I  was  a  Sari,  whose  mission  is  to encourage the autonomy of underprivileged Indian women through  the  production  of  upcycled  products  made  from\n\n- used saris, continued to evolve and develop. 176 craftswomen took  part  in  the  project  in  2021.  An  embroidery  training program entitled 'Now I Can', sponsored by Gucci's Chime for  Change  initiative,  was  launched  on  an  open  source platform in 2021;\n- \u00b7 research  into  working  conditions  and  wages  in  the  Italian luxury  sector:  conducted  by  the  Fair  Wage  Network  and commissioned  by  the  Social  Sustainability  committee  of the Camera Nationale della Moda Italiana of which Gucci is a member, this study helped develop stakeholder understanding of pay practice and draw up a route map towards equal pay;\n- \u00b7 action  for  refugees:  Gucci  continued  its  involvement  with Tent Partnership for Refugees, which mobilizes the private sector to improve the quality of life and resources available to people displaced from their homelands by force, working with NGOs Breaking Barriers in the UK and Jobs 4 Refugees in Germany;\n- \u00b7 Charity: water: Saint Laurent continues to support this NGO, which  works  with  local  associations  around  the  world  to provide  safe  drinking  water  to  people  who  do  not  have access to it and has developed innovative technologies for identifying and repairing faulty pumps.\n\n## 2.5.3 Performance and transparency of the measures taken by the Group to protect human rights\n\nSection  3.1  sets  out  the  findings  and  key  performance indicators  concerning  the  protection  of  human  rights  within the  Group's  operations  in  terms  of  human  resources, occupational  health  and  safety,  and  labor  relations.  Section 2.4  describes  performance  monitoring  for  the  Group's  ethics and compliance procedures. The findings of the social audits carried  out  within  the  Group's  supply  chains  in  2021  are presented in section 4.1.3.3.\n\n- A  cross-reference  table  between  Kering's  human  rights approach and the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework  is  available  on  the  Sustainability/Reporting  and Indicators section of Kering's website.",

Kering's  principal mission  is  to  help  its  employees  reach  their  potential  and express  their creativity by developing  their  skills and performance in the most imaginative way possible. To achieve this, the  Group  provides  its  Houses  with  the  support necessary  for  their  growth,  promoting  the  sharing  of  and access to best practice, and encouraging the identification and development of talent for the benefit of all the Houses. Kering encourages internal mobility, the pooling of expertise and the creation of synergies.\n\nIn  today's  world  of  fast-changing  markets,  competition  and customer needs, identifying, developing and retaining the best talent is a strategic priority.\n\nKering's  goal  is  to  be  the  preferred  employer  in  the  luxury industry, with empowered, motivated employees who want to make a difference in a diverse and open-minded environment.\n\n## A CULTURE OF SHARING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe aim is to continue building a respected Group, that brings together strong Houses united by a shared culture and sense of motivation and in which every employee feels appreciated and committed.\n\nKering continued in 2021 to pursue the HR priorities identified in its 2025 sustainability strategy: to develop talent, preserve craftsmanship, and promote well-being at work and employee commitment. As a result, the dynamic initiated in 2020 with the launch of the Baby Leave policy and the implementation of  the  Inclusion  &  Diversity  (I&D)  action  plan  continued during 2021.\n\nKering  places  the  employee  experience  at  the  hearts  of  its Human  Resources  Strategy.  The  sections  of  this  chapter correspond to key milestones in the career of each employee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering  renewed  its  ties  with  the  Centre  for Sustainable  Fashion  (CSF)  at  the  London  College  of  Fashion (LCF).  Launched  in  2014  for  a  five-year  period  and  then renewed in 2019, this international partnership allows Kering to  affirm  its  commitment  to  the  people  who  will  make  the fashion  of  the  future,  and  to  share  its  beliefs  through  the 'Empowering Imagination' curriculum. Open to students from the  various  disciplines  at  the  LCF,  this  four-month  course combines  theoretical  and  practical  teaching  and  is  updated each  year  in  order  to  integrate  the  latest  scientific  and technical  advances  to  explore  the  issues  of  sustainability  in the world of fashion.\n\nKering and the LCF also launched the first Massive Open Online Course  (MOOC)  on  luxury  fashion  and  sustainability  in  2018. Entitled  'Fashion  &  Sustainability:  Understanding  Luxury Fashion in a Changing World', the six-week course combines films, podcasts, activities and discussions. More sessions will be  held  in  2022.  In  2021,  the  Sustainability  Chair  jointly created by Kering and Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode continued to expand  its  scientific  research  on  a  wide  range  of  topics related  to  fashion  and  sustainability,  from  traceability  to impact assessment to eco-responsible business models. This year,  the  Chair  produced  its  first  major  works,  with  the publication of a research article on textile recycling techniques,  but  also  provided  education  in  sustainability  to more than 1,500 students via a compulsory 30-hour course. A diploma  course  was  also  created,  combining  60  hours  of lessons  (with  contributions  from  experts)  and  practical projects in an educational approach that combines theory and practice.\n\nRenewed in 2020, the Group's partnership with HEC allows it to  support  high-performing  young  people  from  a  variety  of backgrounds and to identify potential hires for the Group and its Houses. The Kering Certificate of Influential Luxury aims to help  future  leaders  learn  how  best  to  handle  luxury  brand management challenges through Kering's vision and values. A team challenge on a topic set by one of the Houses - this year it was Saint Laurent - culminates in a presentation to a panel consisting  of  the  Chair's  academic  co-directors  and  Kering managers.\n\nThe  Group  and  its  Houses  support  numerous  institutions, building  on  the  close  relationships  developed  by  Kering's entire  HR  community  worldwide,  including  the  ESCP,  ESSEC, EM Lyon, Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode (IFM), Istituto Marangoni, Politecnico  di  Milano ,  Bocconi  University,  Polimoda  Fashion School, Istituto Europeo di Design, Accademia Costume & Moda in  Rome,  Tsinghua  University  and  Hong  Kong  Polytechnic University.\n\nThe  Group's  Houses  have  also  established  local  partnerships and developed craft training at centers of excellence in order to  ensure  the  promotion  and  protection  of  the  Group's expertise. These are presented in section 5.3.1.\n\nIn 2021, Kering successfully launched two leadership programs  to  identify  and  support  emerging  young  talent: Kering  China  Cross-Brand  Retail  Excellence  Management Trainee Program in the Asia-Pacific region and Kering Horizon Program in Italy.\n\nThe  Kering  China  Cross-Brand  Retail  Excellence  Management Trainee  program  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region  seeks  to  promote Kering's  image  amongst  young  people  in  China,  where  the Group's  businesses  are  growing  strongly.  It  also  serves  to create a fast-track development stream for talented individuals at an early stage of their careers, to build a pool of potential  candidates  for  the  Houses,  and  to  develop  the potential  of  apprentices.  This  21-month  program  offers participants an ambitious development  pathway.  They undertake a series of internships in different Houses to learn about  the  operation  of  Retail  Management  and  HR.  To publicize  the  program,  Kering  China  presented  it  live  on WeChat,  with  leading  managers  answering  questions  from students  and  potential  candidates.  The  program  has  been  a big success, with more  than  2,800  applications and recruitment sessions held in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen and Wuxi.  35  interns  were  selected  and  began  their  training  in mid-January 2022 with a 2-month  intensive in-store placement.\n\nThe need to cultivate talent in the constantly-evolving supply chain  and  logistics  areas  led  Kering  to  develop  the  Kering Horizon  Program.  Through  experience  in  a  variety  of  roles, mentoring,  and  intensive  training  modules,  this  two-year program  seeks  to  accelerate  the  leadership  potential  of graduate engineers and prepare them for the supply chain and logistics  roles  of  the  future.  The  best  candidates  were recruited  as  full-time  employees  at  Kering  and  began  the program in December 2021.\n\n## Recruit the best talents\n\nIn  addition  to  partnerships  with  schools,  Kering  uses  highly effective  social  media  and  other  tools  to  recruit  the  best profiles  available.  Kering's  Houses  are  constantly  investing  in order  to  offer  the  best  possible  experience  to  applicants through  innovative  and  inclusive  solutions.  In  2020,  Gucci launched an online assessment process that uses augmented reality to give applicants experience while evaluating them for the essential skills required to be a sales associate in one of Gucci's many stores worldwide.\n\nA  training  program  on  inclusive  recruitment  was  introduced for  the  entire  Kering  group  in  2020,  to  help  recruiters  and hiring  managers  identify  common  biases  in  the  recruitment process  and  minimize  their  impact.  The  program,  which  has already been taken by 387 HR employees, covers all stages in the recruitment process, including the issues to be considered when  the  vacancy  is  created,  the  applicant  selection  and interview  processes,  and  the  new  hire's  integration  into  the company.  From  2022,  recruitment  managers  will  also  be trained  in  inclusive  recruitment.  In  addition  to  this  program, several  Houses  have  implemented  fully-fledged  inclusive recruitment strategies, such as Balenciaga's Hiring Pact, which takes a 360\u00b0 approach to drive real-world progress in the area of inclusion and diversity.",

It aims to assist employees when an organizational change (such as a store transfer or closure) is liable to have an impact on jobs.\n\nIn all countries and for all Houses, when departures are being considered following reorganizations, the efforts made to find employees  another  position  go  beyond  what  is  required  by law, and priority is given to voluntary mobility measures.\n\nThe  European  Works  Council  is  also  apprised  of  the  Group's plans  and  the  associated  organizational  changes  during  its two  annual  plenary  meetings,  extraordinary  committees  as necessary,  and  the  meetings  of  its  Select  Committee.  The French Works Council is also informed annually of the Group's plans for organizational change.\n\n## 3.1.2 Furthering employee development in a stimulating and inclusive work environment\n\n## 3.1.2.1 Promoting inclusion and diversity\n\n- \u00b7 Going further than its commitment to social responsibility, the Group believes that inclusion and diversity is a source of  creativity  and  innovation,  and  as  such  of  economic performance.  This  is  why  Kering  makes  every  effort  to establish  a  culture  of  equality  at  all  levels  of  the organization and provides its teams with an open-minded, diverse, inclusive and  stimulating  work  environment, thereby  contributing  to  the  Group's  success.  Kering  pays close  attention  to  diversity  in  employee  profiles  (gender, culture,  origin,  sexual  orientation,  identity  or  disability), which  it  recognizes  as  a  rewarding  source  of  collective intelligence.\n- \u00b7 As  part  of  its  2025  Sustainability  Strategy,  Kering  is promoting diversity and gender equality through a series of concrete  commitments,  which  include  ensuring  salary equity  in  all  functions  and  achieving  gender  parity  at  all levels, and introducing a mentoring program for women at the international level.\n\nIn  early  2015,  the  Executive  Management  of  Kering  and  the European Works Council signed their first European Empowering Talent agreement.\n\nIn June 2019, Kering announced its support for the Standards of  Conduct  published  by  the  UN  to  help  businesses  tackle discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community. In September  2019,  Kering  joined  the  'Open  To  All'  coalition, which combats all forms of discrimination against employees, visitors  and  customers,  including  discrimination  based  on ethnicity,  nationality,  sex,  gender  identity,  sexual  orientation, religion and disability.\n\nRanked  ninth  among  nearly  11,000  companies  from  around the world in Refinitiv's most recent Diversity & Inclusion Index (2021),  Kering  intends  to  build  on  these  results  to  form  an increasingly representative and high-performing team.\n\nEach  House  set  up  an  Inclusion  and  Diversity  Committee in  2020,  sponsored  by  a  member  of  its  management  team. These  committees  are  made  up  of  representatives  from  the various  departments  and  regions.  Their  role  is  to  transpose the  Group's  inclusion  and  diversity  strategy  within  their respective Houses, while adapting it to their specific cultures and  environments.  The  initiative  is  sponsored  by  Kering's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and the sponsor for the Kering  Corporate  Inclusion  and  Diversity  Committee  is  the Group's Chief Financial Officer.\n\nKering sensitizes its employees to the issues of inclusion and diversity. The theme of inclusion and diversity was addressed through  case  studies  on  accepting  cultural  differences  and invisible  disabilities  in  the  workplace  as  one  of  the  four modules  in  the  Ethics  &  Compliance  mandatory  annual training program in 2021.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Inclusion  and  Diversity  teams  reporting  to the  Group  HR  department,  Balenciaga,  Kering  Corporate, Kering  Eyewear  and  Gucci  have  resources  fully  dedicated  to the issue of inclusion and diversity.\n\nSince  2019,  Gucci  has  operated  a  full  inclusion  and  diversity program, including (i) an inclusion and diversity development program for all employees, (ii) a global design scholarship for talented young people in all regions of the world, and (iii) an in-house  international  exchange  program.  Gucci  is  also  a signatory to the UN Charter on LGBTQI+ rights. In 2019, Gucci launched its Global Equity Board in order to define priorities and  monitor  progress  in  the  areas  of  diversity,  equality  and inclusion, in line with Kering's policies.\n\n## Establishing a culture of gender equality within the Group\n\nWhile Kering addresses the issue of diversity in all its aspects, particular emphasis is placed on equal opportunities. In 2010, the Group was one of the first companies in France to sign the Women's  Empowerment  Principles,  drafted  by  UN  Women and the United Nations Global Compact. These principles offer guidance on how to promote the presence and progression of women in business and, more generally, in society.",

        "page_content": "The Group's program for promoting inclusion and diversity focuses on three key priorities:\n\n1. Instilling a culture of equality and inclusion across the Group via awareness initiatives undertaken throughout the year and via its HR and management processes (recruitment, talent review, remuneration, etc.)\n\nTo  mark  International  Women's  Day, Kering once again demonstrated  its commitment to gender equality with the launch  of  the  Pass  It  On  campaign.  This new  initiative  invited  each  employee  to share  a  written  or  video  statement  on Workplace and Lexiang about the women they  have  helped  in  their  life  and  the benefits that he or she saw.\n\nMany  other  initiatives  have  also  been adopted  by  Kering's  various  Houses, including  remote  working,  flextime  and childcare  solutions  in  France,  Italy  and the  United  States,  as  well  as  daycare centers  for  employees  based  in  France and  nursing  rooms  for  employees  in Hong Kong.\n\n## Promoting the advancement of talented women in the Group through special development programs\n\nThe mentoring program for talented women launched in 2013 having been acclaimed by mentees and mentors alike, it forms part  of  the  Group's  full  catalogue  of  talent  development offerings  and  has  been  rolled  out  internationally.  This  year, around sixty talented women from the Group's various Houses in Hong Kong, China, South Korea, France, Italy and the United Kingdom enjoyed a year's individual support from the Group leaders. Mentors are mainly women who benefited themselves from  a  development  program  and  want  to  share  their experience.\n\nFor  the  past  five  years,  Kering  has  also  partnered  the  EVE program,  which  enables  15  employees  from  various  Group Houses and countries to participate in seminars in Europe and Asia. Created in 2010 by Danone, this innovative management program aims to  nurture  strong  and  inspiring  individuals,  in sufficient  numbers  to  enable  them  to  bring  about  corporate change.\n\nLastly, in 2021 Kering published its France 2020 Gender Equality Index for its  Corporate  entities  and  Houses  in  France,  with  a score of 95 points out of 100 for Kering Corporate, marking it as one of the leaders in this area.\n\n## Recognizing and assessing the impact of gender equality initiatives\n\nIn 2021, women accounted for 56.2% of the Group's managers, 63.2% of the total workforce (63.1% in 2020, 62.9% in 2019), 33%  of  its  Executive  Committee  members  and  55%  of  its Directors (excluding Directors representing employees), making Kering one of the CAC 40 companies with the highest proportion  of  women  in  senior  management  positions.  The Group has set a target of achieving a balanced gender mix and equal pay at all levels of the organization by 2025.\n\nKering  came  ninth  in  the  2021  Equileap  ranking,  which recognizes companies that lead the way in achieving gender equality globally.\n\n## 3. Developing an inclusive and exemplary parental policy\n\nKering  has  been  committed  to  a  widereaching  parental  policy  since  2017, supporting parents and helping to create a culture of equality in the Group. Baby  Leave,  launched  in  January  2020, allows all parents - mothers, fathers or partners - to take 14 weeks of fully-paid leave to care for their child. It contributes to gender equality in a practical way by guaranteeing  the  same  parental  leave rights to both men and women, ensuring equality  for  all  Kering  employees.  This makes an effective contribution to tackling the  prejudices  women  face  whenever they apply for a job, seek a promotion or attempt to advance their careers.\n\nEfforts  made  to  promote  female  talent  provide  an  overall reflection  of  how  committed  the  Group  is  to  women,  both inside and outside the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 through  the  Kering  Foundation,  which  combats  violence against  women  by  supporting  projects  led  by  NGOs  and social entrepreneurs  and  by  raising  awareness  and promoting involvement among the Group's employees. The Kering  Foundation  also  works  to  raise  awareness  among employees  by  involving  them  in  many  of  its  projects.  On International  Day  for  the  Elimination  of  Violence  against Women  (November  25),  the  Kering  Foundation  launched the  '16  Days  16  Films'  campaign  in  the  United  Kingdom, France and Italy, in partnership with Modern Films and with the  participation  of  non-profit  organizations En  Avant Toute(s) , Chayn Italia, the National Network to End Domestic Violence  (NNEDV), Fondo  Semilias and  the  'UK  SAYS  NO MORE'  campaign.  In  line  with  UN  Women's  '16  Days  of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence', 16 films directed by women were posted on social media between November 25  and  December  10.  The  campaign  reached  more  than 900,000 people in five countries via social and print media (see section 5.4.1);\n- \u00b7 the  Group  firmly  believes  that  businesses  have  a  decisive role  to  play  in  combating  violence  against  women.  In  line with International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 190 on  violence  and  harassment  in  the  workplace,  the  Kering Foundation  worked  with  the  Group  Human  Resources Department  in  2020  to  draft  a  global  policy  on  domestic violence. The internal program developed by its teams aims to provide appropriate support for survivors and victims of domestic violence and came into effect on January 1, 2021;\n- \u00b7 in the film industry, as an Official Partner of the Cannes Film Festival, Kering showcases and supports the contribution of women to  the  film  industry,  both  behind  and  in  front  of the camera, through its Women in Motion initiative;\n- \u00b7 in its supply chains, notably via the study on women's roles in  the  luxury  segment  supply  chain,  conducted  by  Kering and  its  Italian  Houses  in  collaboration  with  the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI) (see section 4.1.2).\n\n2.

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting the integration of people with disabilities\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Kering  group  employed 531 workers with disabilities (coverage rate of 86.8% excluding the United Kingdom and the United States).\n\nKering confirmed its commitment to the integration of people with  disabilities  with  the  European  Empowering  Talent agreement signed in February 2015. This agreement reiterates and reinforces the commitments  made  to  employee representatives  in  2008  with  regard  to  promoting  the employment of people with disabilities.\n\nEach  year,  management  presents  a  progress  report  to  the European  Works  Council  on  the  agreement's  three  pillars, which  include  promoting  diversity  in  general,  and  on  the initiatives  undertaken  by  the  Houses  in  the  areas  of  gender equality and equal opportunity.\n\nThe  Group's  Houses  in  France  and  Italy  also  continue  to outsource to the sheltered sector to promote the employment of people with disabilities. Special service providers employing  workers  with  disabilities  are  called  on  for  such services as printing, data  entry, archiving, replying to unsolicited  applications,  catering,  preparing  mailshots,  gift packaging during the holiday season, and landscaping.\n\nKering Corporate and  the  Group's  Houses  also  forge partnerships and deploy awareness campaigns to ensure that employees  are  onboard.  For  example,  Ulysse  Nardin  and Girard-Perregaux have initiated a project with Swiss foundation  Alfaset  and  are  currently  discussing  various options  for  integrating  people  with  disabilities  into  their workshops,  as  interns  or  on  contracts  relating  to  specific projects.  In  2021,  Kering  Corporate  offered  employees  two awareness-raising programs: thanks to the DuoDay platform, a number  of  people  with  disabilities  from  outside  the  Group took part in a 'live-my-life' day with Kering employees, whilst several  teams  took  part  in  a  'musical  blind  test',  involving disabled  artists.  The  game  is  a  fun,  interactive  way  to  raise awareness  about  disability  diversity  and  the  importance  of fostering a culture of inclusion.\n\n## Forging partnerships to facilitate the employment of young or disadvantaged people\n\nTo preserve and pass on their expertise, several of the Group's Houses,  namely  Gucci,  Bottega  Veneta  and  Brioni,  have created  vocational  schools  and  training  programs,  with  the support of trade associations. The aim is to give young people the  opportunity  to  learn  a  trade  that  will  ultimately  enable them to join one of the Group's Houses or find employment elsewhere  in  the  luxury  or  fashion  industries  (see  section 5.3.1).\n\nKering is working with charities T\u00e9l\u00e9maque and Energie Jeunes to  make  concrete  progress  in  equality  of  opportunity,  by making it easier for all employees to volunteer during working hours (see Giving Back).\n\nIn  2021, Gucci built on its commitment to the integration of refugees  through  a  process  of  inclusion  at  its  Italian  offices and  production  facilities;  this  employment  and  training program  is  called  #forRefugees.  This  commitment  was recognized for the second consecutive year by the 'Welcome. Working  for  Refugee  Integration'  prize  from  the  United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR). In 2021, the House took part in the latest edition of the prize.\n\n## 3.1.2.2 Development of talent and skills\n\nDeveloping  skills  and  talents  is  at  the  heart  of  Kering's  HR policy.  In  2021,  Kering  consolidated  the  community  and initiatives launched following the pandemic. This community has worked in three main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the fundamentals of our internal mobility policy;\n- \u00b7 maintaining training despite uncertainty and the difficulties in getting employees together;\n- \u00b7 strengthening  the  use  of  our  internal  platform  to  support employee development.\n\n## Managing and supporting talent, and fostering mobility and professional development within the Group\n\nKering  has  set  itself  the  priority  of  better  identifying  and developing  talent,  and  has  for  this  purpose  established processes  and  tools  geared  towards  helping  employees constantly expand their career prospects and strengthen their skills through mobility and career opportunities.\n\n## 1. Developing a shared culture of performance\n\nTalent  and  leadership  potential  are  identified  through  the performance appraisal process and talent reviews.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  introduced  the  People  Performance  and Development  Annual  Review,  between  employees  and  their managers, to assess performance relative to jointly-set targets and  the  employee's  development  needs.  This  appraisal  and the  associated  form  strengthen  the  dynamic  evaluation approach  introduced  in  2019  and  combined  with  regular check-in  conversations.  Interviews  will  take  place  between January  and  late  March  2022,  in  accordance  with  a  detailed timetable  drawn  up  by  each  House.  User  guides  and  other materials are made available by the Houses to help employees and  managers  prepare  for,  conduct  and  follow  up  on  the interview.  Meanwhile,  dedicated  training  sessions  for  HR teams  at  all  the  Houses  were  delivered  by  the  Group  in January 2022.\n\nTo  ensure  that  employees  receive  appropriate  support,  the Group provides training to Human Resources teams via the HR Academy.  Comprehensively  reviewed  in  2021,  this  has  the fundamental  aim  of  helping  all  HR  teams  around  the  world develop  their  professional  skills,  access  an  internal  expert network, ensure their personal development and prepare for future  changes  in  the  world  of  work.  Nearly  500  people accessed these sessions in 2021.\n\nOnce talented individuals have been identified, the aim is to gain  a  clearer  picture  of  their  profile,  define  the  support initiatives needed  in  terms  of  organization  and  talent development, and prepare succession plans for key positions. In 2021, the process of identifying talent within the Group was expanded  to  include  more  roles  in  order  to  support  the creation  of  talent  development  plans  and  the  ability  to anticipate the organization's needs.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Promoting mobility and careers within the Group and its Houses\n\nProfessional mobility is a pivotal means to help develop skills, offer  career  prospects  and  give  everyone  the  opportunity  to grow within the Group.\n\nA review was started in 2021 with all Houses to define a new basis for easier internal mobility. As the shared objective is to accelerate the number of internal openings, it was agreed that there should be greater transparency on available roles, giving employees  greater  control  over  their  careers  and  supporting internal  applications  in  order  to  enhance  the  culture  of professional development within the Group.\n\nEmployees can now apply for a position  after  18  months  of service. They can also register as internal candidates and have confidential  contact  with  internal  recruiters  before  applying. Regular meetings of the HR community have been organized to  enable  on-going  dialogue  on  recruitment  needs  and available  people.  The  whole  HR  community  has  received  the appropriate  training  and  support  materials  have  been  made available to all. The introduction of this new policy was backed by a communication campaign.\n\nLastly, Kering is nurturing future talent. The HR departments at the Houses participated in a 3-day seminar on HR and retail trends  in  order  to  anticipate  changes  in  business  needs through changes in the skills base within their House.\n\n## Developing a structured training policy for all employees\n\nIn 2021, the Kering group devoted a budget of \u20ac28 million to employee training, corresponding to 1.15% of the total Group payroll.  On  this  basis,  577,504  hours  of  training  (excluding safety  training)  were  provided  across  Kering's  Houses  during the  year,  an  increase  of  6.6%  on  2020;  43,695  employees (including leavers) took at least one training course.\n\nWomen accounted for 63.2% of the workforce trained in 2021 (excluding  safety  training).  Furthermore,  83.6%  of  employees trained were non-managers.\n\nIn  light  of  the  Houses'  new  operations  and  Kering's  new projects,  the  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  people trained  and  the  number  of  training  hours  illustrates  the Group's desire to give employees the means to develop and to assist new staff members.\n\n## Breakdown of employees who received training by manager/non-manager and by gender in 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Developing digital training pathways with the introduction of a new platform integrated into the HR information system: Kering Learning\n\nIn 2021, Kering Learning reached more than 33,000 users and provided more than 50,000 hours of training (60,000 content items). A specific effort was made to support all employees in the  development  of  their  foreign  language  skills,  which resulted  in  a  75%  increase  in  platform  users  and  more  than 20,000 hours of training completed (up 132%).\n\nAfter a period of development in 2020, the goal for 2021 was to  improve  the  visibility  and  access  to  training  around  three pillars:\n\n- 1. communication:  a  number  of  campaigns  to  increase employee engagement with Kering Learning;\n- 2. employee  voice:  giving  all  employees  an  opportunity  to express their interest in Group programs;\n- 3. personalization: offering targeted pathways depending on skills and/or position.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe digital channel also allowed broader dissemination of our commitments to inclusion and diversity. Balenciaga continued its  Masterclass series, focusing on the 'stand against racism' pillar. Bottega Veneta has developed several video modules on the same topics and on stereotypes. Brioni launched a weekly communication campaign to inform employees on vocabulary related  to  this  topic  and  the  lived  experiences  of  their colleagues,  in  order  to  encourage  inclusive  behavior.  Gucci launched  a  program  open  to  all  employees  to  train  them  in diversity, unconscious bias and an inclusive client approach.\n\nDigital  training  is  a  key  lever  for  supporting  employees  and enhancing  their  skill  levels,  with  links  to  the  topics  of  the future.  It  forms  part  of  the  Group's  forward-looking  job  and skills  planning,  which  is  implemented  at  all  levels  of  the organization, from the Human  Resources department (Learning  Expeditions  on  future  trends)  to  in-store  teams (training  in  distance  selling),  to  anticipate  and  support businesses' transformation.\n\n## 2. Developing and maintaining a regional offer for managers and employees from all Group Houses\n\nIn  2021,  Kering  continued  its  management  development programs (People Management Essentials, People Management Advanced,  Career  Conversations)  and  introduced  a  new program,  PME  Booster,  based  on  shared  intelligence  and peer-to-peer transmission of concrete experience in six-person\n\n## Kering Leadership\n\nComposed of three four-day modules held over 12 months, the Kering Leadership program brings together approximately 25 leaders in a multicultural context each year. The aim is to nurture  talented  employees  and  develop  their  leadership capacities. The class of 2021 consisted of participants from our  three  regions  and  eleven  different  Houses  and  Group entities.  The  program  ran  in  a  hybrid  format,  with  some participants  traveling  and  a  small  number  of  people following the program remotely.\n\n## Kering Vision\n\nThe program was adapted into a digital format in 2021. For three  half-days  per  week  over  a  three-week  period,  34 participants from Europe and Asia collaborate on a strategic Group  project.  In  preparation  for  their  work  on  these projects, participants meet members of the Kering Executive Committee  and  business  leaders  from  other  luxury companies  and  adjacent  industries  and  learn  new  work methods.  At  the  end  of  the  program,  they  present  their projects  to  a  jury  of  senior  executives  from  Kering  and  its Houses.\n\ngroups.  The  success  of  the  pilot,  in  French  and  Italian,  in summer  2021,  resulted  in  the  introduction  of  this  booster format as a follow-up to more traditional training programs.\n\nThe  circumstances  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  meant  that training on  management  of  remote  teams  continued: management  of  virtual  meetings  (in  terms  of  impact  and participant  engagement),  initiation  into  intercultural  matters in  the  professional  world,  and  notably  the  development  of  a new program centered on our way of working and co-operating with  China,  which  represents  a  significant  challenge  in  the luxury industry.\n\nIn total,\n\n- \u00b7 in Europe,  35  virtual  training  courses  were  offered (including  a  face-to-face  workshop),  with  380  employees receiving training;\n- \u00b7 in  Asia,  excluding  managerial  programs,  which  are  offered in face-to-face format, 275 employees were trained in 2021 thanks to the 14 virtual programs offered.\n\n## 3. Digitalization of the Group's talent programs\n\nIn  2021  many  of  the  practices  created  during  the  COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 were retained, with technological resources allowing the continued training of our employees when they were unable to travel outside their home country.\n\n## Kering Navigate\n\nThe  Group  implemented  a  new,  international  and  100% virtual program called Kering Navigate. Targeting the Group's young  leaders,  the  program  brought  together  51  people from  the  Group's  various  businesses,  covering  10  different nationalities.  It  gave  participants  the  opportunity  to  reflect on the complexity of the situation and to find resources to manage  the  crisis  and  the  associated  changes  in  work practices  as  effectively  as  possible.  Participants  benefited, over a six-month period, from internal conferences, training with  external  service  providers,  participation  in  working groups and individual support.\n\n## Kering Mentoring\n\nIn  the  autumn,  Kering  rolled  out  its  mentoring  program, designed to develop talent by drawing on the experience of senior  managers  and  providing  the  opportunity  to  live  a shared experience within the Group. In Europe, 50 people, or 25 mentor-mentee pairings, from nine different Houses and four  different  countries  (France,  Italy,  the  United  Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom) came together to start a six-month  development  program.  In  Asia,  30  people  from ten different Houses took part in the program.",

Over  the  years,  Kering  has fostered employee commitment through shared experiences, helped to create a common culture, strengthening the feeling of belonging to an integrated Luxury Group.\n\nThrough  our  integrated  communication  platforms  launched in  2018,  everyone  at  Kering  now  has  a  voice  and  can  access Group  information  at  any  time,  via  any  device  (computer, smartphone or tablet). The proximity between Group employees and  executives  is  regularly  enhanced  by  live  chats  on  the corporate  social  networks  between  employees  and  one  or more of the executives, on key topics as diverse as sustainability, financial results and the company's strategy.\n\n## Global communication campaigns about the Group's values and policies\n\nThe internal communication campaigns conducted by Kering strengthen  the  Group's  shared  history  and  vocabulary  and enable  the  deployment  of  new  HR  resources  and  policies centered around the Group's shared values:\n\n- \u00b7 For the sixth consecutive year, a five-week communication campaign  was  conducted  via  the  two  corporate  social networks to inform all employees about Kering's culture of integrity  and  the  ethical  principles  applicable  across  the Group.  This  campaign  accompanied  the  on-line  training program  'Code  of  Ethics  -  Do  the  right  thing!',  which  is mandatory  for  all  employees  in  all  Houses  and  in  2021 focused  on  four  themes  -  human  rights,  corruption, biodiversity, and inclusion and diversity at work. Once again this  year  the  uptake  rate  of  96%  reflects  the  commitment to this subject of all Group employees worldwide.\n- \u00b7 Internal mobility is key in ensuring the retention of talent. This  is  why,  yet  again  this  year,  the  Group  launched  a promotional campaign for managers on the one hand and employees on the other, in order to emphasize the benefits for all stakeholders.\n\n## Focus on: Kering People Survey #NoFilter, the Kering employee opinion barometer\n\nIn 2021 Kering ran the fourth edition of its employee opinion barometer - Kering People Survey #NoFilter - to measure the level of engagement of employees at the Group and the Houses around the world. In addition to the standard questions, this year's survey included ten new questions on the theme of Inclusion & Diversity. This campaign recorded an excellent score, with 87% responding (up 5 points on 2019; 87% for women, 87.3% for men) and an engagement rate of 82% despite the difficult  circumstances. The Group Executive Committee and the CEO of the Houses have collated the results of this survey  and  shared  detailed  action  plans  with  their  employees,  committing  them  to  responding  to  the  expectations expressed.\n\n- \u00b7 Amongst the lessons from Kering People Survey, the quest for meaning at work was shown to be a strong requirement for employees. This is why, this year, Kering proposed a new initiative  called  Giving  Back.  Giving  Back  is  a  volunteering program  for  employees  at  certain  Houses  who  want  to contribute to creating a better world. Through partnerships with  non-profit  organizations  selected  by  the  Group, employees have 21 hours per year (around 3 working days) to  volunteer  and  support  their  local  communities.  This program operates in France and Italy and will be rolled out to the UK in early 2022 and then to the rest of the world.\n- This  program  forms  part  of  the  same  process  as  Gucci's 'Gucci  Changemakers' volunteer program, created in 2019 to  encourage  all  Gucci  employees  worldwide  to  support their local communities. The program allows employees to spend  up  to  four  days  of  their  working  time  helping non-profit organizations in four key areas: the environment, education,  social  justice,  and  health  and  well-being.  More than  2,400  applications  to  take  part  were  received  and 270  activities  were  added  around  these  four  areas  of impact, with 1,600 employees worldwide becoming involved through 130 collaborations with non-profit organizations.\n- \u00b7 In  order  to  build  employee  awareness  of  on-line  security, this year Kering launched a new training module on topics of privacy and cybersecurity. This mandatory training for all employees  across  the  Group  and  its  Houses  was  entitled Privacy  &  Cybersecurity  e-learning,  and  was  split  into  two modules,  the  first  on  protection  of  employees'  personal data, the second on the protection of client data. This new training  program  had  an  excellent  participation  rate  with 90% uptake.\n- \u00b7 Every  two  years,  Kering  brings  together  its  250  Top Managers  for  a  week  entitled  Imagine.  In  2021,  the 100%-digital  edition  welcomed  external  and  internal contributors,  notably  including  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault, addressing a variety of themes: Inclusion & Diversity,   the industry outlook, etc.\n- \u00b7 Given the nature of its businesses and the client base of its Houses, combating violence against women is a key issue for  the  Group,  which  has  been  committed  to  this  cause since  2008  through  the  Kering  Foundation.  Since  2011, 1,685 employees, including the Group Executive Committee, have received training to help them understand the impact of  domestic  violence  and  promote  a  supportive  work environment  for  women  who  are  victims  of  domestic violence.  The  Kering  Foundation  has  also  developed  a 30-minute e-learning  session,  available  in  English,  French and  Italian.  The  Kering  Foundation  encourages  Group employees  to  use  both  their  professional  and  personal skills  to  support  partner  NGOs  and  social  enterprises. Since  2014,  the  International  Volunteering  Program  has allocated between two and four days to employees joining a  two-week international solidarity  mission.  The  COVID-19 pandemic meant that the program was put on hold in 2021. This year, volunteering opportunities offered by the Kering Foundation  have  been  brought  under  the  umbrella  of Giving Back.\n\nCertain internal events designed to bring employees together, foster cohesion and enhance employee engagement had to be canceled in 2021 because of the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This charter has  enabled  the  Houses  to  develop  and  implement  action plans based on three key principles:\n\n- 1. identifying  and  assessing  the  causes  of  stress  in  the workplace;\n- 2. deploying preventive measures to improve quality of life at work and reduce workplace stress factors;\n- 3. keeping  employees  informed  and  giving  them  the opportunity  to  provide  anonymous  feedback  so  that  the Houses' action plans can be adapted, adjusted or enhanced.\n\nSince 2015, health, safety and the quality of working life have been  the  key  thrusts  of  Kering's  commitments  under  the European agreement signed with the European Works Council on February 19, 2015. Within this framework, the Houses are adopting  procedures  and  taking  action  to  identify,  assess, reduce  and  prevent  the  key  risks  associated  with  their activities. They are also taking initiatives designed to achieve continuous  improvements  in  the  quality  of  work  life.  Kering has in turn undertaken to develop a working environment and working relationships that ensure well-being at work, in order to promote the development of all employees and contribute to the Group's performance.\n\nThe quality of working life is part of the day-to-day experience of  employees  who  were  given  the  opportunity  to  express themselves through the Group's biannual opinion barometer that  allows  employees  to  be  heard  and  helps  prevent psychosocial  risks.  The  most  recent  Kering  People  Survey #Nofilter in 2021 included questions on the quality of life at work, morale, stress, the work-life balance, health and safety and mental health.\n\nefforts on providing a single, constant stream of information for all employees worldwide, regardless of how the pandemic was evolving in each country. Maintaining ties with employees both  during  and  after  lockdown  periods  contributed  to  the quality of working life.\n\n## Promotion of workplace safety and management of psychosocial risks\n\nIn  2020  and  2021,  two  years  dominated  by  the  COVID-19 pandemic, the management structures within each House or country organization ensured that health and safety measures were implemented at all levels of the organization worldwide. National,  regional  and  local  procedures  were  developed  by the  entities  to  put  into  practice  Kering's  global  health  and safety policies. A continuous  consultation  process  was initiated  with  employees  on  the  topics  of  health,  safety  and well-being to enable everyone at Kering to play a role in the prevention and protection measures. Employee-support resources were made available (including 24-hour hotlines in China and France, and individualized support in Japan), backed up  by  innovative  applications  (such  as  Joyable  in  the  USA). Pilot  well-being  at  work  programs  were  launched,  including #takecare  at  Kering  Corporate  and  Be  well  at  Alexander McQueen.\n\nThe Group made all of its HR platforms available to maintain constant  ties  with  employees,  regardless  of  the  national health situation in their country of location.\n\nIn  addition,  Kering  and  its  Houses  implemented  numerous protective  measures  at  Group  sites  worldwide  to  ensure  the health  and  safety  of  employees  and  clients,  in  line  with  the government's  recommendations  in  each  country  and  any changes to such recommendations.\n\nIn  2021,  233  lost-time  accidents  were  recorded  across  all  of the Group's Houses, compared with 2019 in 2020.\n\nThe health crisis affected both 2020 and 2021. The Group sought to ensure transparency and empowerment by communicating on  the  corporate  social  networks.  The  Group  focused  its\n\n## Frequency and severity rate of accidents in 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n|                                                                                          |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Frequency of work-related accidents (Number of accidents  per million hours worked)      |   3.46 |   3.5  |   5.07 |\n| Severity rate of work-related accidents (Number of days lost  per thousand hours worked) |   0.1  |   0.09 |   0.11 |\n\nAcross  all  of  the  Group's  Houses,  28  employees  were recognized as suffering from a work-related illness in 2021.\n\nThe Kering's comprehensive health and safety policy is based on  best  practice  from  across  the  organization.  It  aims  to ensure that a clear governance structure is in place and that\n\nregular internal audits and other processes are implemented Group-wide, with a view to achieving the ultimate goal of zero accidents.  It  also  requires  the  Houses  to  take  specific measures  to  improve  quality  of  life  at  work  for  retail employees and to conduct regular health and safety audits.",

The Houses are committed  to  the  principle  of  risk  prevention  and  the preservation  of  occupational  health  and  safety  involving multiple  stakeholders,  including  the  Social  and  Economic Committee's  Health,  Safety  &  Working  Conditions  team, ergonomists, occupational physicians and external prevention specialists. In terms of risk prevention, 53,101 hours of safety training were provided to 7,282 Group employees in 2021.\n\n- (1) Sales:  employees  working  in  wholesale,  stores  and  e-commerce. Production: employees working in production (workshops, tanneries, etc.) Other areas: employees working in support or logistics functions.\n\n## Overall lost time and sick leave (in %) in 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n|                                 | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Overall absenteeism rate        | 5.3%   | 5.6%   | 4.9%   |\n| Absenteeism rate due to illness | 2.8%   | 2.9%   | 2.5%   |\n\nThe  total  figure  for  absenteeism  due  to  illness  includes  sick leave, work-related illness, work-related accidents and commute-related  accidents.  The  overall  absenteeism  rate includes  absenteeism  due  to  illness  and  every  other  kind  of absence (maternity leave, paternity leave, unjustified absences, etc.), calculated from the first day of absence.\n\nKering also works to prevent psychosocial risks and offers its employees  psychological  support.  In  France,  a  toll-free number  is  available  to  all  employees  who  feel  that  they require  psychological  support,  regardless  of  the  reason. Support  is  also  provided  when  employees  are  collectively affected by a particular event or situation.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  initiatives,  the  Houses  explore  various other avenues, including:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying  psychosocial  risk  factors  at  work  (e.g.,  Kering Corporate,  Bottega  Veneta  and  Gucci  through  SA8000  and ISO 45001 (formerly OHSAS 18001) certification);\n- \u00b7 preventing  psychosocial  risks  and  stress  by  bringing  in healthcare professionals, such as physiotherapists, osteopaths, sophrologists, and teachers of yoga, Pilates, and meditation  (at  the  Kering  and  Saint  Laurent  head-quarters, etc.), and providing social assistance services for employees. Audits were conducted in 2019, for Kering Italia and Gucci, to identify strengths in this area and avenues for improvement;\n- \u00b7 promoting  work-life  balance  (smart  working,  extension  of the remote working program, flextime, etc.) and introducing the  right  and  duty  to  disconnect  in  France  as  a  result  of legislative  changes.  These  changes  notably  relate  to  the right  of  all  employees  to  disconnect  from  work  during non-working hours and their duty to regulate their use of digital devices during working hours.\n\nThe Group maintained its Kering People Survey #Nofilter 2021 opinion  survey,  including  questions  on  the  quality  of  life  at work  and  creating  an  opportunity  to  listen  to  employees, analyze their responses and prepare action plans, such as for the prevention of psychosocial risks. See section 3.1.2.4.\n\n## Organization of work\n\nKering  strives  to  implement  an  organized  and  collective structure,  as  well  as  methods  and  know-how  that  allow employees to work together in the interest of the Group and based on set objectives.\n\nThe average working time of the Group's full-time employees is  40  hours  per  week.  In  2021,  37,052  overtime  hours  were logged in France, a decrease on 2020.\n\nIn 2021, 2,138 employees logged overtime hours. Staff working part time accounted for 5.5% of permanent employees, down from the previous year, and were located mainly in the United States  and  Western  Europe.  Contractual  working  hours  are spread  out  on  the  basis  of  the  specific  business  and organization  of  each  House,  either  over  certain  days  of  the week, or over reduced time slots on all working days.\n\nThe organization of working time remains a topic addressed by the Group's Houses and varies according to the countries, sites  and  employees  concerned  (in  stores,  production  and workshops  or  support  functions).  Kering  Corporate  and  the Houses make every effort to organize the work of employees in strict compliance with local health, safety and environment guidelines, including those relating to the health crisis.\n\nIn France, work is most commonly organized on the basis of a fixed number of hours or days, with annualized working time and the possibility of flextime.\n\nBeyond these legal aspects, the Houses try to find and offer more flexible ways to organize working time in order to meet their own needs as well as those of their employees as part of their  policy  on  quality  of  life  at  work:  flextime  for  several Houses, the introduction of a smart working pilot plan at the Bottega  Veneta  and  Gucci  headquarters  in  Italy,  continued remote working at the Kering headquarters in Paris, leave to care  for  sick  children  at  Boucheron  and  part-time  work  at Pomellato.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the global pandemic, 2020 and 2021 saw  the  launch  of  a  project  on  new,  flexible  work  methods, with the creation of a multi-brand working group that meets in  each country. Houses in the pilot countries meet regularly to  share  best  practice  and  talk  about  flexible  work  methods. Discussions  are  also  held  with  managers  and  employee representatives  in  order  to  find  the  most  appropriate solutions  while  also  ensuring  employee  well-being  and  a healthy work-life balance.\n\n## Promoting a better work-life balance and fostering workplace well-being\n\nThe Group and its Houses are implementing actions in favor of a  better  organization  of  professional  and  personal  lives, benefiting  both  men  and  women  and  based  around  three pillars.\n\n## 1. Operating a strong parental policy\n\nThe  finest  testimony  to  Kering's  commitment  to  work-life balance and its respect for working parents is its comprehensive parental policy, deployed in 60 host countries on January 1, 2017 and further enhanced by the introduction of Baby Leave on January 1, 2020.\n\nThe  policy  aims  to  promote  a  better  balance  between employees'  professional  and  personal  lives  and  to  achieve equality  between  female  and  male  employees,  regardless  of their personal circumstances, guaranteeing all Group employees  worldwide  the  same  minimum  benefits  on  the arrival of a child, namely 14 weeks' paid leave.\n\nThe Group's Houses and Kering Corporate are also implementing  initiatives  in  this  regard:  to  facilitate  their return to work, Kering Corporate France allows new parents to opt  for  part-time  work  at  80%  of  standard  working  hours without  any  loss  of  pay  during  the  month  following  their return  from  maternity,  paternity  or  adoption  leave;  Bottega Veneta has introduced its 'Master for U' program; and Gucci, Pomellato,  Kering  UK  and  Kering  Italia  all  offer  specific employee benefits.\n\n## 2. Encouraging, where possible, more flexible work methods that enable employees to better organize their lives\n\nFlexible work was suggested by Kering employees as a way of improving  quality  of  life  at  work  and  enhancing  work-life balance, in response to the open-ended question included in the employee opinion survey conducted in 2019 and 2021 in all  host  countries.  The  measures  deployed  by  the  Group  and its Houses as part of their action plans address this desire for more flexible work methods.\n\nThe deployment of company-wide platforms for HR, information,  communication,  training  and  dialogue  has  also contributed  to  improving  quality  of  life  at  work.  All  Group employees now have access to the same resources, regardless of  their  location,  profession  or  position,  representing  a  key factor in employee well-being.\n\nThe Houses were also able to capitalize on measures relating to well-being at work, such as the organization of workplaces in  line  with  the  highest  standards,  as  well  as  flexible  work times, work-life balance and health and well-being.\n\nThe  accelerated  deployment  of  these  new  practices  in  2021 was supported by all teams, particularly the HR, IT and Security teams, and was facilitated by the digitalization of the Group's communication  platforms,  to  protect  the  performance, engagement and well-being of employees.\n\n## 3. Creating a work environment in which work-life balance is both an objective and a reality\n\nKering  receives  recognition  for  these  initiatives,  and  the Group's participation in external networks serves to promote its developments in this area and help it continue to come up with innovative actions. Kering has been a member, since 2016, of a discussion platform initiated by the International Labour Organization  (ILO),  known  as  the  Global  Business  Network, the French-speaking  branch  of  which  brings  together French-speaking companies that are committed to developing joint international social security programs.\n\nKering continues to contribute to the work of the French-speaking  ILO  network  and  has  been  involved  in  the production of three guides to best practice. The most recent of these, 'Adopting a strategy of parental support and measuring its impact' was published in 2021.\n\n## 3.1.3 Remuneration and employee benefits\n\nAround \u20ac2.4 billion in Group personnel expenses in 2021 (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Chapter 6 of this document).\n\n## 3.1.3.1 Remuneration policy\n\nRemuneration is a key component that managers can use to reward  the  commitment  and  the  individual  and  collective performance of their teams.\n\n## Performance-related remuneration\n\nThe  various  components  of  the  pay  structure  and  their management  are  based  on  principles  defined  by  the  Group, such as the close alignment between remuneration, individual contribution and collective performance.\n\nAccordingly,  90%  of  the  Group's  employees  receive  a  fixed salary  and  a  variable  pay  component  that  is  subject  to  the achievement of individual and/or collective objectives.\n\nThe  individual  share  of  variable  pay  is  determined  and managed  as  part  of  the  performance  management  process. Each employee's contribution to the team's results is assessed by  their  direct  manager  in  accordance  with  the  level  of achievement of the targets set and their behavior throughout the year.\n\nIn a similar  spirit  of  recognizing  and  rewarding  team performance and the contribution of all employees to Kering's growth and success, the Group is eager to introduce incentive plans  in  countries  where  this  is  encouraged  by  the  local legislation.  In  France,  nearly  all  employees  benefit  from  a profit-sharing mechanism.\n\n## Competitive and fair remuneration\n\nEfforts  are  made  to  ensure  that  the  amount  of  fixed  salary received  by  each  employee  is  both  fair  internally  and competitive within the market. Fixed salary raises are granted in accordance with the level of the salary already achieved in comparison with peers and/or the external market, factoring in performance over time and the potential for development.",

        "page_content": "The existence of a framework for all jobs within the Group and shared by all Houses (known as the 'Job Catalogue') enables their accurate definition based on both area of expertise and level  of  responsibility.  This  is  particularly  helpful  during  the internal  and  external  competitiveness  analyses  that  are regularly conducted by the Group, and for the fair allocation of variable pay and certain benefits in kind.\n\nManagement  of  individual  careers  within  the  Group  and  of impacts  on  individual  remuneration  is  conducted  without consideration of gender or age.\n\nIn 2021, the Group developed the Kering Parity Index, to allow Houses to evaluate and monitor their parity performance over time. This index  consists  of  four  individually-weighted indicators:  indicator  of  parity  in  the  300  executive  positions with  the  greatest  level  of  responsibility,  gender  pay  gap  by level of responsibility, comparative opportunities for men and women to benefit from a promotion or job development, and comparative  opportunities  for  men  and  women  to  receive  a pay rise. It will be calculated annually for each House and at a consolidated level for the Group in order to identify areas of weakness requiring specific corrective measures and allow the monitoring of changes in these various metrics over time.\n\nGucci has begun an analysis of gender pay equality on a global level,  focusing  on  more  than  45  countries.  Gucci  is  in  the process of preparing its first Gender Gap report, an innovative tool  for  the  private  sector  that  will  help  formulate  and implement actions designed to promote an inclusive culture and  identify  opportunities  to  engage  in  a  process  of  change and  improve  gender  equality  within  the  company.  As  a  pilot project, the first report will concentrate on employees in Italy, covering corporate, in-store and production populations.\n\n## Remuneration and social commitment\n\nUpstream  of  the  principles  of  fairness  and  competitiveness adopted  and  applied  by  Kering,  the  Group  has  a  strong commitment to guaranteeing a decent standard of living to all employees and their families.\n\nIn 2021, Kering carried out a global study to define, for each of the  countries  in  which  it  is  active,  the  Kering  standards  that provide  this  guarantee  of  a  decent  standard  of  living  to  all employees and their families. The factors taken into account when  defining  this  standard  of  living  include  food,  water, housing, education, healthcare and other essentials.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  that  these  thresholds  are  reliable  and legitimate,  the  Group  has  drawn  on  the  Fair  Wage  Network methodology,  which  collects  and  analyzes  information  for different countries on a standardized basis. New research that becomes available in each country is systematically integrated by the organization. Thus, over time, this process adopted by Kering will lend its commitments greater accuracy and power.\n\n## 3.1.3.2 Executive pay\n\nWithin Kering's senior management (Top 450), the remuneration of 300 people in particular is monitored by the Group's  Human  Resources  Department,  with  the  aim  of ensuring internal consistency and competitiveness in light of industry practice.\n\nThe  remuneration  structure  for  senior  executives  (portions allocated  as  base  pay  and  as  short-  and  long-term  variable remuneration) is defined by the Group. It varies in accordance with the level of responsibility assigned to the role.\n\nThe  short-term  variable  remuneration  (annual  bonus)  policy aims to reward senior executives for meeting objectives - in part  financial  and  in  part  individual  -  set  in  line  with  the strategy of the Group and the Houses. Financial performance is  assessed  on  the  basis  of  two  indicators,  dedicated  to measuring  profitability  (recurring  operating  income)  and assessing the quality of the free cash flow of the Group and the Houses.\n\nThe  long-term  profit-sharing  policy,  meanwhile,  meets  two objectives,  rewarding  executive  teams  for  their  performance over time and for their loyalty to the Group.\n\nSince 2020, all executives have had performance shares, which now  represent  the  main  element  of  Kering's  long-term profit-sharing structure. The number of shares granted to each executive varies with their level of responsibility. The number of shares delivered at the end of the vesting period depends (for  +/-50%  of  the  shares  granted)  on  Kering's  share  price performance compared to a reference index of luxury industry stocks.\n\nFor  executives  working  within  a  Group  House,  the  Kering performance  shares  are  accompanied  by  monetary  units  in the same proportion, linked to the valuation of the House for which they work. These monetary units were launched in 2013 and their unit value evolves over time in line with the increase in the House's value. At the end of a three-year vesting period starting from the year that the monetary units were granted, executives  have  the  opportunity  to  exchange  their  monetary units  during  two  cash-in  windows  per  year  over  each  of  the subsequent two years.\n\n## 3.1.3.3 Employee benefits within the Group\n\nIn  addition  to  monetary  remuneration,  the  Kering  group  has always  placed  much  importance  on  offering  its  employees healthcare,  disability/life  cover  and  pension  benefits,  as  well as ensuring their well-being more generally. In addition to the coverage  provided  by  law,  virtually  all  employees  therefore enjoy supplementary insurance through the various schemes in operation in the Group's Houses.\n\nFor some years, the Houses have offered more comprehensive benefit plans in line with best practice in each country. Such plans  often  include  benefits  relating  to  well-being,  sports, education, recreation, transportation or family support. As far as  possible,  these  benefits  are  available  flexibly  and  can  be selected  to  meet  the  needs  of  each  individual.  This  was  the guiding  spirit  behind  the  introduction  in  2020  of  the ambitious  Flex  Benefits  program  for  Gucci's  employees  in China. These popular plans are constantly changing to better meet employees' expectations.\n\nKering  promotes  its  employees'  work-life  balance,  given  its close  relationship  with  well-being.  Kering  has  reviewed  and improved  its  annual  leave  policies  around  the  world.  All employees now receive a minimum of two weeks of paid leave per year, notably in Asia and the USA, where paid leave is not covered  by  local  labor  law.  The  paid  leave  policy  allows employees to 'recharge their batteries' so as to better engage with  and  contribute  to  a  positive  and  balanced  work environment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Council  members  newly  appointed  in  each  country  met  in Paris on December 1, 2 and 3, 2021 and were able to attend the  cultural  events  organized  by  the  management  team  to celebrate  the  anniversary  and  recognize  social  dialogue  at Kering.\n\nAnother 2021 highlight was the economic and social training of the French Works Council members appointed in 2019. This training took place, face to face, in Paris and fed through into Kering's social dialogue at a national level.\n\nDespite  the  health  crisis,  the  two  plenary  sessions  of  the European  Works  Council  and  the  annual  meeting  of  the French  Works  Council  were  held  in  2020,  either  totally  or partially  as  physical  meetings  with  all  of  the  necessary protective  measures.  In  addition  to  scheduled  meetings, regular updates were organized with the offices of the Group's two  employee  representative  bodies,  throughout  2020  and 2021, in order to discuss such issues as the COVID-19 situation and  the  measures  taken  to  protect  the  health  and  safety  of employees.\n\n## 3.1.4.1 Listening to and engaging with employees\n\nBy  promoting  free  expression  within  the  Group  and  ongoing social dialogue with employee representatives, Kering has long made  clear  its  determination  to  forge  sustainable  and constructive  relationships  with  all  its  employees  and  their representatives.\n\nEach House adopts these commitments and Kering's policies. Through  its  innovative  employment  policies  the  Group provides 100% coverage of its employees, notably through the provision of 14-week paid Baby Leave, preventative measures in health and safety and in the field of human rights.\n\nIn 2020, social dialogue provided a key opportunity to discuss health  and  social  developments  in  France,  Europe  and worldwide.  Scheduled  meetings  and  preparatory  meetings were  maintained,  with  the  help  of  an  expert,  ensuring  the continued  success  of  the  Group's  employee  representative bodies and its social dialogue process.\n\nSocial  dialogue  was  also  enhanced  by  direct  messages  to employees  from  Group  and  House  executives  via  Workplace, the  corporate  social  network  accessible  to  all  employees, regardless of the local health situation. Communication with employees was constant, candid and open to comments.\n\nThe number of informal meetings between the secretariats of the  European  Works  Council  and  the  Group's  French  Works Council was increased in 2021.\n\nThe  number  of  working  hours  of  industrial  action  totaled 1,673 in 2021, compared with 150 in 2020 and 632 in 2019, in light of a recovery in global activity and solidarity movements towards external causes.\n\n## 3.1.4.2 The Group's forums for social dialogue\n\n## The Kering European Works Council\n\nCreated  pursuant  to  the  agreement  of  September  27,  2000, the Kering European Works Council (EWC) provides a Europe-wide forum  for  information,  consultation,  the  exchange  of  views and dialogue. The principal purpose of the EWC is to become a key  intermediary  in  the  development  of  social  dialogue between European countries with differing realities and social practices.\n\nThe EWC is a cross-border institution and operates alongside existing national employee representative bodies in accordance with  specific  prerogatives.  The  discussions  that  take  place within  the  EWC  enable  the  employee  representatives  to acquire a better knowledge and understanding of the Group's organization, strategy and main challenges.\n\nThe EWC holds two three-day plenary sessions per year with Group  Management,  at  which  it  is  informed  of  and,  where applicable,  consulted  on  cross-border  issues  affecting  the Group's  employees  in  a  manner  defined  in  precise  terms  by the new agreement signed for an indefinite period.\n\nThe  EWC  also  has  a  Select  Committee  composed  of  five members, elected by their peers, who meet at least four times a year to prepare and analyze the two annual plenary sessions and to discuss various issues with Group Management.\n\nIn 2021, membership of the EWC was renewed for a four-year term.  The  EWC  met  on  two  occasions,  one  of  which  was attended by Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the Group's Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  the  Select  Committee  met  four times. Regular  meetings  are  also  held  with  the  EWC secretariat.\n\n## The French Works Council\n\nWithin all of its Houses in France, the Group engages in social dialogue with employee representative bodies and as part of negotiations with unions.\n\nCreated  in  1993  and  renewed  most  recently  in  2015,  the Kering group Works Council represents workers in France and operates under French law. Its members, who meet in plenary sessions once a year, are kept informed of and exchange views on the Group's strategies, economic and financial imperatives, and HR management policy. Each plenary session is preceded by two preparatory meetings of members that allow them to seek expert advice and ask questions of the Board prior to the annual plenary session.\n\nOn February 27, 2020, an agreement renewing the powers and resources attributed to the French Works Council was signed unanimously  by  the  unions  for  an  indefinite  period.  In application  of  this  agreement,  two  days  of  economic  and social training was provided to the members of the Council on September 29 and 30, 2021. The topics addressed during the physical  meetings  of  the  French  Works  Council  in  April  and May and on June 4 included an update on the social, economic and  financial  situation  of  the  Group  and  its  Houses,  a presentation on the 2021 ethics and compliance training, and a  discussion  relating  to  questions  submitted  in  advance  by French Works Council members.\n\nKering  also  took  advantage  of  the  two  days'  training  of  the French  Works  Council  members  to  incorporate  training  on issues of social dialogue.",

The Climate Strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy  and  the  Circularity  Ambition  jointly  define  Kering's framework for action in environmental protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.2.1.1 Climate Strategy\n\nKering is targeting a Net Zero trajectory aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn  2016, Kering was the first luxury goods group verified and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its carbon footprint reduction targets. The Group revised its SBTs, approved  by  the  SBTi  in  early  2021,  to  adopt  the  1.5\u00b0C scenario, and has made  the  following commitments through 2030, based on its 2015 emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 90% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from Kering  operations  (whole  of  Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol Scopes 1 and 2);\n- \u00b7 70%  reduction  in  the  intensity  of  supply  chain-related greenhouse  gas  emissions  (Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol Scope 3), consistent with the EP&L objectives.\n\nIt aims to achieve this by:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing emissions;\n- \u00b7 offsetting emissions that cannot be reduced;\n- \u00b7 taking into account material climate-related risks (physical risks and transition risks) for greater resilience.\n\nTo meet these targets, Kering has developed a Climate Strategy based on four main areas:\n\n| 1. Mitigation of climate-related risks  through emissions reduction   | 2. Adaptation and resilience thanks  to nature-based solutions   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 3. Offsetting and achieving Net Zero                                  | 4. Industry transformation                                       |\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  defines  the  Group's  ambitions  and provides details of all targets in the area as well as the means of action and measurement.\n\n## 3.2.1.2 Biodiversity Strategy\n\nThe  Group's  Houses  primarily  use  natural  materials  to manufacture their  products.  These  raw  materials  come  from farms,  rangelands,  forests  and  mines.  With  supply  chains spread around the world (wool in New Zealand, cashmere in Mongolia,  organic  cotton  in  India,  etc.),  Kering  is  particularly attentive to the preservation and health of natural ecosystems.\n\nIn 2020, the Group published its corporate biodiversity strategy, which aims to stem the loss of biodiversity, re-build ecosystems, and  rehabilitate  species  as  well  as  to  drive  systemic  change throughout the supply chain and beyond. Kering is committed to having a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2025:\n\n- \u00b7 Kering  has  structured  its  activities  around  four  phases: avoidance, reduction, restoration/regeneration and transformation. Kering is applying this conservation hierarchy  as  recommended  by  the  Science  Based  Targets Network  (SBTN),  which  brings  together  leading  scientists and environmental NGOs from around the world to create a trajectory for nature and to develop scientific methods for ensuring that human activities respect planetary limits;\n- \u00b7 Kering has made quantitative commitments:\n- - by  2025,  Kering  will  drive  the  transition  to  regenerative agricultural practices on an additional million hectares in areas where raw materials entering Kering's supply chain, such as leather, cotton, wool or cashmere, are extracted. To  achieve  this,  Kering  has  partnered  with  Conservation International to create the Regenerative Fund for Nature, which  will  support  projects  for  the  transformation  of farming and breeding practices in areas that supply raw materials to the fashion industry;\n- - by  2025,  Kering  will  protect  one  million  hectares  of essential and irreplaceable habitats outside of its supply chain, primarily through programs that will be beneficial on multiple levels, in terms of biodiversity protection, carbon sequestration and improved livelihoods for local people.\n\nThese  two  million  hectares  represent  nearly  six  times  the global  footprint  of  Kering's  direct  and  indirect  (supply chain)  operations,  which  has  been  calculated  by  the  EP&L as  350,000  hectares.  Kering  has  therefore  included  a significant  security  margin  in  its  efforts  to  have  a  net positive impact on biodiversity.\n\nThe initiatives under way are presented in detail in section 4.2.1.\n\n## 3.2.1.3 Circularity Ambition 'Coming Full Circle'\n\nExiting from the 'take, make, waste' culture goes well-beyond the issue of recycling. Moving to a truly circular economy will require  a  profound  re-imagining  of  production,  resource  use and the lifespan of products.\n\nThe circular economy offers Kering an opportunity not only to evolve  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  resources,  but  also  to innovate  to  better  serve  its  customers  and  its  sustainability goals. Kering sees the circular economy as a real opportunity to  shape  the  industry  and  adapt  it  to  the  needs  of  future generations.  The  'Coming  Full  Circle'  approach,  published  in May 2021, has three central pillars:\n\n- 1. Luxury that lasts;\n- 2. regenerative supply and clean production;\n- 3. more efficient production processes.\n\nKering  has  set  several  targets:  zero  destruction  of  unsold goods,  100%  renewable  energy  by  2022,  zero  single-use plastic  by  2025,  100%  of  raw  materials  in  compliance  with Kering standards by 2025, and zero microfiber waste by 2030. Such a paradigm shift will require investment, innovation and a pro-active approach.\n\nBut  we  need  to  go  further.  In  particular,  it  is  essential  that Kering  acts  collectively,  with  its  Houses  and  its  value  chain, whilst introducing open-source solutions to allow its ecosystem  to  evolve.  Launched  in  2019,  the  Fashion  Pact represents  the  first  stage  of  the  industry  as  a  whole  taking responsibility for its environmental impact. In February 2021, Kering  announced  the  launch  of  the  Made  in  Italy  project, conducted by the Apparel Impact Institute, which works with various brands  in order to improve  efficiency, waste management  and  energy  use  of  our  suppliers.  Kering  also works  closely  with  several  experts  including  The  Microfibre Consortium,  The  Apparel  Impact  Institute  and  The  Ellen MacArthur Foundation.",

The Group has committed to reduce its EP&L intensity by 40% by 2025 compared with 2015.\n\nThe EP&L serves primarily as a decision-making tool providing input  to  the  Group's  sustainability  projects  and  guiding  the day-to-day choices of decision-makers, with the ultimate goal of  reducing the environmental impact of both Kering and its supply  chains.  Going  further  than  traditional  environmental reporting,  the  EP&L  covers  six  categories  of  environmental impact:  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  air  pollution,  water\n\npollution, water consumption, waste production and land use. It  allows  Kering  and  its  Houses  to  measure  their  impacts  on natural  capital  throughout  their  value  chains  and  assign  a monetary  value  to  them.  Kering  uses  the  EP&L  results, expressed in monetary terms, to:\n\n- \u00b7 translate its environmental impacts into a common business language;\n- \u00b7 compare environmental impacts between separate units;\n- \u00b7 compare, for any given environmental indicator, the magnitude of an impact for different locations;\n- \u00b7 facilitate comparisons between its Houses and business units;\n- \u00b7 ultimately, to choose between and prioritize actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Rather, they represent a way of assessing the cost to society of environmental  changes  stemming  from  the activities of the Group and its suppliers, by taking account of local  contexts  and  the  impacts  on  local  populations.  The construction  of  the  EP&L  draws  on  databases  containing  a level  of  uncertainty  inherent  in  the  principle  of  evaluating environmental  impacts  using  LCA  methods  (Life  Cycle Analysis) and economic modeling tools.\n\nIn 2021, Kering continued its work, seeking to:\n\n- \u00b7 align  the  production  of  EP&L  results  with  the  Group's reporting  year,  to  end  the  one-year  timing  difference  that had  previously  existed.  Thus  the  2021  EP&L  results  are included in this 2021 Universal Registration Document;\n- \u00b7 increase the reliability of the data used in the EP&L, notably by automating the reporting of a certain number of items and by adding control and verification processes. In order to strengthen this approach and provide stakeholders with greater  confidence,  the  Group  voluntarily  submitted  its 2021  EP&L  for  verification  by  an  independent  third-party organization,  whose  report  is  included  at  the  end  of  this NFIS;\n- \u00b7 expand  the  scope  of  coverage  by  integrating  product  use and end-of-life impacts covering activities 'from cradle to grave'. Use and end-of-life impacts have thus been included in  EP&L  results  for  2020  and  2021  (excluding  jewelry  and watches).\n\nIn keeping with its commitment to transparency, Kering shares all 2021 results and an analysis of the progress made, together with the coefficients used in the calculations (multipliers and coefficient  values  for  conversion  to  monetary  terms)  on  the open source platform kering-group.opendatasoft.com. In addition, a methodological note specific to the EP&L is available on the kering.com website, which sets out the framework used by the group  and  highlights  the  key  methodological  elements  that shape  the  process  and  the  calculations,  including  the monetary aspects developed with the help of PwC.\n\nA final noteworthy initiative is the My EP&L app, which gives all users the keys to understanding the environmental impact of luxury  products  and  aims  to  reinforce  information  and transparency around natural capital accounting.\n\n## Scope covered by the EP&L approach\n\n+ MONETIZATION OF THESE IMPACTS ON LOCAL POPULATIONS /parenleft.cap\u20ac/parenright.cap\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each year, the results and lessons learned from the EP&L are reviewed by the top management of each House.

In\n\nmore general terms, 2021 brought a turning point for Kering's progress in  reducing  its  environmental  footprint,  with  a  41% reduction in EP&L intensity compared with 2015 (1) .  The  2025 target was thus achieved four years early.\n\nThe Group's environmental impact amounted to \u20ac562 million in 2021 on published figures (that is including impacts in use and  at  end  of  life).  Although  this  represented  a  16% improvement  on  2020,  it  is  more  relevant  to  compare  it to  2019,  a  year  in  which  business  activity  was  not  directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with 2019, the 2021  EP&L  showed  an  11%  reduction  in  absolute  terms (comparable basis), thus reflecting the progress made by the Houses  both  in  the  optimization  of  materials  use  in production and in the integration of lower-impact materials in their collections.\n\n## Change in Group EP&L intensity 2015 to 2021, comparable basis (\u20acEP&L/\u20ac1,000 in revenue)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- EP&L intensity: \u20acEP&L per \u20ac1,000 in revenue\n- Targeted reduction in EP&L intensity to achieve the 40% reduction objective by 2025.\n\n## Main changes in comparable basis EP&L between 2020 and 2021\n\nAfter a year in 2020 that saw a fall in procution and sales as a result  of  the  global  health  crisis,  2021  brought  a  return  to normal, and an increase in sales on 2019.\n\nAgainst this background, the volumes of materials purchased rose  strongly,  compared  with  2020,  resulting  in  increased environmental impacts due to the production and processing of  those  materials.  This  is  particularly  true  for  leather  and metals. However, this increase in volumes has been offset to a degree  by  the  Houses'  progress  in  their  efforts  to  integrate into  their  operations  an  increasing  proportion  of  recycled materials or innovative, lower-impact alternatives.\n\n## EP&L impact (in \u20ac millions)\n\nA detailed analysis of the Group's environmental profile shows that the supply chain accounts for 79% of impacts, with 66% attributable  to  the  production  of  raw  materials  (Tier  4)  and their  initial  processing  (Tier  3).  The  weight  of  use  and end-of-life impacts is relatively limited, accounting for only 7% of  the  total  impact  and  concentrated  mainly  on  use,  with end-of-life representing only 0.2% of the total.\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use and water pollution remain  the  predominant  impact  indicators,  accounting  for around  80%  of  the  total  impact.  This  confirms  the  strategic thrust of Kering's environmental policy.",

Between  10 and  50  employees  met  at  each  session  of  the  Idea  Labs  to workshop the following issues:\n\n- \u00b7 the Kering Standards for raw materials and manufacturing processes;\n- \u00b7 energy management and purchases of green energy;\n- \u00b7 gender parity in our supply chains;\n- \u00b7 supplier assessment based on sustainability criteria;\n- \u00b7 traceability in operations and supply chains;\n- \u00b7 circularity;\n- \u00b7 animal welfare;\n- \u00b7 key  raw  materials:  leather,  precious  skins,  cashmere,  fur alternatives,  cotton  and  precious  metals  (gold,  silver, palladium) for jewelry and the galvanization of metal parts;\n- \u00b7 best practice in client communication on sustainability;\n- \u00b7 a focus on the specific issues in jewelry.\n\n## Training on reporting tools, indicators and processes\n\nKering develops systems such as the environmental reporting system, or  EP&L,  along  with  standards  for  raw  materials  and production  processes  to  help  the  Houses  manage  their environmental impact.\n\nProduced  each  year  since  2003,  the  Group's  environmental reporting draws on around one hundred indicators. Representative  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  Group's Houses,  these  indicators  fall  into  eight  categories:  energy consumption, water consumption, water pollution, management of environmental risks, goods transportation, business travel, waste production and use of raw materials.\n\nTo  ensure  consistent,  standardized  reporting  practices  are used across the Group, specific training is provided every year on  these  tools,  complemented  by  annual  updates  to  guides and handbooks in three languages, and supported by internal communication through the Group's social network.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  is  available  on  Kering's  website, under  Sustainability  (Methodological  Note  Environmental Reporting, 2021).\n\n## Certification procedures\n\nThe number of Group sites for which certification is relevant is limited due to the nature of the Group's activities. Certifications related to the implementation of environmental management systems, such as ISO 14001, are sought primarily for the sites with the greatest environmental impact, such as large logistics centers  and  tanneries.  By  end-2021,  all  of  the  Group's tanneries  had  received  ISO  14001  certification.  Some  brands are  upgrading  their  environmental  certification  to  include ISO  14064,  which  is  specific  to  the  quantification  and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nSome sites have also received certification for health & safety (ISO 45001),  social  accountability  (SA8000)  and  quality management  (ISO  9001).  Thus  all  Gucci's  Italian  stores  and outlets  have  both  SA  8000  and  ISO  45001  certification. In  2019,  Gucci  also  attained  ISO  20121  Sustainable  Events certification for its Guccio Gucci business.\n\nThe  list  of  the  Group's  certifications  is  provided  in  the methodological  note  on  environmental  reporting  for  2021, which is available on the Group's website.\n\n## 3.2.3 Identification of Group economic activities covered by European \"Green Taxonomy\" regulation\n\n## 3.2.3.1 The principles and key performance indicators of the \"Green Taxonomy\"\n\nThis  section  has  been  prepared  by  the  Kering  Group  in application of European Regulation 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the 'Green Taxonomy\" Regulation) on the establishment of a framework to support environmentally sustainable investments.\n\nThe  \"Green  Taxonomy\"  seeks  to  identify  economic  activities that  meet  at  least  one  of  the  following  six  environmental objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 climate change mitigation;\n- \u00b7 climate change adaptation;\n- \u00b7 the  sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water  and  marine resources;\n- \u00b7 the transition to a circular economy;\n- \u00b7 pollution prevention and control;\n- \u00b7 the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe  application  of  the  \"Green  Taxonomy\"  regulation  will  be phased in over three years, starting from the end of 2021. At present, economic activities 'eligible' for the \"Green Taxonomy\" are defined only in terms of the first two objectives of climate change  mitigation  and  adaptation  (Annexes  I  and  II  to  the Climate Delegated Act). In respect of these first two objectives, the  European  Commission  has  prioritized  those  sectors  of activity  that  emit  the  most  greenhouse  gases  or  those  that contribute  substantially  to  climate  change  mitigation  or adaptation within the European Union.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the \"Green Taxonomy\" regulation required the publication of three key performance indicators (KPIs) identifying the share of activities eligible for the \"Green Taxonomy\" by virtue of the two climate objectives:\n\n| Indicator                                                                                         | Revenue                                                                                                                                                                         | Capital expenditure (Capex)                                                                                                                                                                                     | Operating expenses (Opex)                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| \"Total Taxonomy revenue\" Total revenue as shown in the Group's consolidated  financial statements | \"Total Taxonomy Capex\" Increase in gross balance sheet value  of leases right-of-use assets (IFRS 16),  property, plant and equipment (IAS  16), and intangible assets (IAS 38) | \"Total Taxonomy Opex\" Direct non-capitalized expenses  relating to the maintenance and repair of property, plant and equipment, the  renovation of buildings, research and  development, and short term rentals | Denominator  as defined by  the regulation |\n| Share of revenue  associated with economic activities covered by the  \"Green Taxonomy\"            | Share of Capex or Opex:                                                                                                                                                         | Share of Capex or Opex:                                                                                                                                                                                         | Numerator  (eligible share)                |\n| Share of revenue  associated with economic activities covered by the  \"Green Taxonomy\"            | 1.

        "page_content": "## 3.2.3.2 Kering Group's application of the Taxonomy\n\nUnder  the  first  two  objectives,  luxury  industry  revenue (including,  in  particular,  the  following  product  categories: leather  goods,  shoes,  ready-to-wear,  watches  and  jewelry)  is not eligible  for  the  \"Green  Taxonomy\".  The  \"Green  Taxonomy\" nevertheless requires reporting of Capex and Opex as defined by the regulation. At this stage, therefore, the Kering Group is affected  by  the  \"Green  Taxonomy\"  primarily  with  regard  to capital expenditure on buildings (construction and renovation of buildings and installation of equipment to increase energy efficiency  in  buildings)  and  leases  right-of-use  assets.  The \"Green Taxonomy\" is likely to become more representative of the  environmental  issues  specific  to  the  Group's  activities once  it  is  extended  to  include  the  other  four  environmental objectives  by  2023.  The  Group  will  review  its  reporting methodology  and  the  figures  produced  in  accordance  with developments in the regulations and most notably following the publication in 2022 of the Delegated Acts relating to the other four environmental objectives.\n\nIt should be noted that, for Kering, the GHG emissions targeted by  the  Taxonomy  regulation  under  the  first  two  climate objectives only concern buildings and, as a result, account for\n\nless than 20% of Kering's total GHG emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3 of the Group's operations). The Group is acting more broadly to reduce its carbon footprint across all sources of emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3). Over and above the \"Taxonomy Capex\" and \"Taxonomy  Opex\"  categories,  as  defined  in  the  climate objectives  of  the  European  regulation,  Kering  seeks  to optimize  the  energy  efficiency  of  its  own  operations  and, going further, to minimize its environmental footprint through investment  meeting  best  practice  and  the  most  demanding standards  and  certification  requirements.  The  main  actions taken by the Group within its own operations and in its supply chains  are  described  in  the  following  sections  (particularly sections 3.2.5 and 4.1.4).\n\n## Revenue\n\nTotal  \"Taxonomy  revenue\"  for  2021  corresponds  to  the amount  shown  in  the  Group's consolidated financial statements as  presented  on  page  336  of  the  2021  Universal Registration Document, and is thus \u20ac17,645 million.\n\nThe Kering Group's revenue does not fall within the scope of activities  eligible  under  the  first  two  climate  objectives. Eligible revenue is therefore nil for 2021.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\n| Investment category                        | Increase in gross value 2021 (in \u20ac millions)   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Lease right-of-use assets (IFRS 16) (1)    | 1,219                                          |\n| Property, plant and equipment (IAS 16) (2) | 733                                            |\n| Property, plant and equipment (IAS 38) (3) | 268                                            |\n| TOTAL TAXONOMY CAPEX (DENOMINATOR)         | 2,220                                          |\n\nEligible  \"Taxonomy  Capex\"  (numerator)  represents  61%  of Kering's Total \"Taxonomy Capex\" (denominator). Eligible items related  mainly  to  the  increase  in  rights-of-use  assets  under store leases. The Taxonomy requires the inclusion of all lease right-of-use assets both in the denominator (Total Capex) and the  numerator  (Eligible  Capex)  of  the  Capex  indicator.  These rights-of-use assets correspond to the present value of future rent payments that the Group undertook when signing a real estate lease. As a result, the values presented do not represent a  tangible  investment  by  the  Group  in  an  underlying  real estate asset as this remains entirely the property of the lessor.\n\nIn  addition,  eligible  \"Taxonomy  Capex\"  includes,  under  the heading  of  property,  plant  and  equipment,  other  investment expenditure  relating  to  the  energy  efficiency  of  our  stores, warehouses and offices.\n\nAnalysis  of  the  Group's  intangible  assets,  notably  investment in  software,  did  not  identify  any  investment  eligible  for  the Taxonomy.\n\n## Operating expenses (Opex)\n\nIn  2021,  Total  \"Taxonomy  Opex\"  was  less  than  5%  of  the Group's  total  operating  expenses  (cost  of  sales,  personnel expenses and other recurring operating expenses (1) ). Given this limited  amount  and  the  nature  of  the  expenses  covered, which  do  not  represent  the  core  business  of  Kering  or  its Houses, the work carried out concluded that this indicator was not  material  for  the  Group.  The  numerator  is  therefore considered  to  be  zero.  In  accordance  with  the  regulations, analysis  of  eligible  \"Taxonomy  Opex\"  was  not  therefore conducted.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Sustainability  Committee  supervises  the Group's  Climate  Strategy.  In  addition  to  considering progress  by  the  Group,  the  Committee  examines  subjects such  as  the  Group's  carbon  offsetting,  as  well  as  the physical and transitional risks relating to climate change. A Lead  Director  was  nominated  in  2019,  with  the  role,  in coordination with the Chairman, of representing the Board in  its  dealings  with  investors  concerning  environmental, social  and  governance  (ESG)  matters.  The  meeting  of Independent  Directors  in  November  2021,  called  by  the Lead Director, focused on the impacts of COP26 for Kering and the ESG responsibilities, most particularly those related to climate change, of the Board of Directors. A decision was taken in 2021 that will come into effect in 2022 to appoint a member of the Board of Directors as climate change lead and for the topic to be on the Board's agenda twice a year;\n- \u00b7 at  the  Executive  Committee  level:  the  Chief  Sustainability and  Institutional  Affairs  Officer  is  a  member  of  the Executive Committee and reports directly to the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer.  She  is  responsible  for  the definition and implementation of the sustainability strategy. She  evaluates  and  manages  the  risks  and opportunities  relating  to  climate  change  at  a  Group  level, through the implementation of sustainability action plans and projects;\n- \u00b7 incorporation  into  executive  pay:  the  variable  elements  of the  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer  and  Group  Managing  Director  are  in  part  linked  to non-financial  criteria  (in  2021,  sustainability  represented 10%  of  the  criteria  for  annual  variable  remuneration  and biodiversity 10%  of  those  for  multi-annual  variable remuneration).\n\nA  cross-business  working  group  made  up  of  key  functions (finance,  financial  communication,  risk  management)  was created  in  2020,  under  the  leadership  of  the  Sustainability Department  and  with  the  support  of  internal  and  external experts. In 2021, its work covered the development of climate scenarios  and  an  initial  exercise  to  evaluate  the  potential financial impacts of certain risks and opportunities. Progress made  was  presented  to  Executive  Management  and  the Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Group's strategy for tackling climate change is set out in detail in its Climate Strategy, published in 2021, which frames and defines the Group's ambitions in the area together with resources for action and measurement.\n\n## 3.2.4.2 Strategy and scenarios\n\nAs  the  first  stage  of  its  assessment  of  impacts,  Kering  has drawn up two climate scenarios, based in part on the effects of climate change on the economy on the one hand and the political,  economic,  social,  technological,  environmental  and legal (PESTEL) effects on the other hand:\n\n- \u00b7 an  'accelerated  transition'  scenario,  based  on  warming  of less  than  1.5\u00b0C  by  2100.  Aligned  with  the  Group's  Climate Strategy and SBT 1.5\u00b0C objectives, this scenario is based on a  strong  response  from  governments  and  international institutions, high carbon prices, significant awareness-raising amongst consumers on climate change and its consequences, and,  more  generally,  actions  to  anticipate  and  mitigate climate change.\n- \u00b7 a 'business as usual' scenario, based on warming of around 4\u00b0C by 2100. This scenario is based on limited intervention from  governments  and  international  institutions,  low carbon  prices,  increasing  pressure  on  trade,  economic stagnation  or  contraction  and,  more  generally,  a  primarily reactive adaptation to climate change.\n\nTwo time horizons were considered: 2035 (short term) and 2055 (long term).\n\nFor both scenarios, assumptions were based on scientific research, most  notably  the  RCP2.6,  RCP4.5  and  RCP8.5  Representative Concentration Pathways from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change  (IPCC)  and  modeling  from  experts  including the International Energy Agency (IEA), World Bank and World Resource  Institute.  These  scenarios  also  took  account  of recommendations  from  ISO  14090/91,  the  TCFD  and  the Institute 4 Climate Economics (I4CE).\n\nAlso drawing on the results of Kering's EP&L, the whole value chain  was  included  in  the  analysis  framework  for  Kering's scenarios.\n\nThese scenarios fed into the assessment of risks for the Group (see Chapter 5 of this document).",

        "page_content": "## 3.2.4.3 Risks and opportunities identified\n\nDrawing  on  these  two  scenarios,  Kering  has  mapped climate-related  risks  and  opportunities,  identifying  12  main risks  and  7  main  opportunities  with  potential  consequences for  its  business  and  the  development  of  its  strategy.  This mapping also included interviews with contributing departments and internal experts and took account of practice at our peers. A variety of risks, from the impacts of climate change on the supply of key raw materials, to carbon pricing, to the effects of extreme  climatic  events  on  the  Group's  infrastructure, alongside  those  linked  to  consumer  expectations,  were\n\nidentified. This mapping gave rise to differentiated assessment approaches  for  the  impact  of  risks  and  opportunities,  which fed  into  the  review  of  policies  and  strategic  directions. Forming  part  of  a  process  of  continuous  improvement,  this research also identified additional action areas for strengthening the Group's management of climate risks and prioritizing the action plans adopted.\n\nIn order to carry out an in-depth analysis and initial estimates of their potential financial impacts, work in 2021 focused on three  risks  and  three  opportunities,  published  in  detail  in Kering's 2021 response to the CDP Climate questionnaire:\n\n| Category of risks  and opportunities   | Heading                                                                     | Probability of  occurrence by 2035   | Scale of potential  financial impact 2035   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Transition risks                       | Effect of carbon pricing on direct  operating costs                         | Likely                               | Medium-high                                 |\n| Physical risks                         | Impact of thermal stress on availability  of bovine leather                 | Likely                               | Medium-high                                 |\n|                                        | Extreme events affecting Group  infrastructure                              | Likely                               | Medium-high                                 |\n| Opportunities                          | Reduction in electricity expenses by using  renewable electricity resources | Likely                               | Medium-high                                 |\n| Opportunities                          | Increased resilience from regenerative  grazing practices                   | Likely                               | Medium-high                                 |\n| Opportunities                          | Carbon credits from regenerative  agriculture projects                      | Likely                               | Medium-high                                 |\n\nKering plans to manage climate-related risks and opportunities, anticipating  their  effects  and  ensuring  its  resilience  by adapting its business model, governance and decision-making processes and its supply chain. The evaluation of climate risk is  today  an  integral  part  of  Group  risk  management  (see section 1.4.2 and Chapter 5 of this document).\n\n## 3.2.4.4 Indicators and reporting\n\nThe table below summarizes Kering's reporting in response to the  TCFD  recommendations.

This  progress  is notably  the  product  of  the  energy  efficiency  measures undertaken at stores, offices and industrial sites by Kering and its Houses. Kering's ongoing efforts in this area, together with its strategy of purchasing green electricity, should enable it to maintain this positive performance in the coming years, in line with  the  trajectory  defined  by  Kering  on  the  basis  of  the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nThe  transportation  and  energy  emission  factors  taken  for carbon reporting on the Group's operations (as set out hereafter) include  Scope  3  items  for  upstream  phases  (extraction, refining, transportation, electricity line losses, etc.).\n\n## Carbon footprint of Group operations\n\nEnergy  consumption  and  the  transportation  of  goods  and people are the two main sources of CO2  emissions from the Group's  operations.  In  2021,  total  emissions  amounted  to 301,509 tons of CO2. This represents 14% of the 2,143,465 tons of CO2 relating to the Group's entire value chain (EP&L scope).\n\nDetails  of  the  emission  factors  used  are  set  out  in  the methodological  note  on  environmental  reporting  for  2021, which is available on the kering.com website.\n\n## Breakdown of total transportation and energy-related CO2 emissions from Group operations in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  proportion  of  transportation-related  as  opposed  to energy-related emissions was relatively stable between 2020 and 2021. 2021 saw a significant increase in activity relative to  2020.  This  is  reflected  in  a  sharp  increase  in  the transportation of goods and a growth in the use of renewable energy.\n\n## Energy consumption and related CO2 emissions\n\n## Energy-related emissions\n\nThe  Group  uses  the  energy  consumption  indicators  listed below  to  assess  its  energy  use  and  related  greenhouse  gas emissions, both direct (Scope 1 of the GHG Protocol: burning of natural gas and heating oil and consumption of vehicle fuel on  site  and  LPG)  and  indirect  (Scopes  2  and  3  of  the  GHG Protocol: electricity and  steam  production,  line  losses, upstream production phase of energy fuels and treatment of waste generated by electricity production). The rest of Scope 3 is presented in the EP&L section (see section 4.4.3).\n\n## Energy consumption and related CO2 emissions in 2021\n\n|                                              | Energy consumption (MWh)   | Related CO2 emissions (metric tons of CO2)   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Electricity                                  | 254,325                    | 35,622                                       |\n| Natural gas                                  | 63,403                     | 15,460                                       |\n| Heating oil                                  | 1,834                      | 594                                          |\n| Steam, heating, cooling                      | 4,486                      | 484                                          |\n| LPG                                          | 72                         | 20                                           |\n| Fuel for transportation and on-site handling | 190                        | 61                                           |\n| Biomass                                      | 860                        | -                                            |\n| Other energy sources                         | 638                        | 250                                          |\n| TOTAL ENERGY                                 | 325,808                    | 52,491                                       |\n\n<!-- image -->",

All  invoices,  documents  and  data from  sites  where  a  Kering  entity  has  signed  an  energy agreement  are  put  up  on  an  easy-to-access  platform.  The system covers Europe, the United States and Asia, and allows for:\n\n- \u00b7 streamlining  the  energy  procurement  process  by  pooling and consolidating energy consumption;\n- \u00b7 increasing the use of renewable energy;\n- \u00b7 centralizing energy procurement management;\n- \u00b7 improving analysis of energy consumption data;\n- \u00b7 more effective communication with energy companies and the authorities.\n\nThe project has resulted in tangible energy savings and lower costs for the Houses and the Group. The system has gradually evolved,  including  data  from  smart  meters  for  a  growing number of sites and extending the scope of application to not just electricity and gas but also, since 2021, to urban heating, urban cooling and water.\n\n## Minimizing energy use and measuring energy efficiency improvements\n\nThe Group takes two main types of measures to optimize the energy efficiency of its sites:\n\n- 1. Systematically obtaining recognized, high-level certification for new sites renovated by Kering.\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  are  increasingly  implementing certification  for  their  sites  and  stores.  Certification  is sought  for  new  sites  targeted  by  Kering's  Real  Estate teams  from  2019.  US-based  LEED  (Gold  and  Platinum level) is the preferred certification system selected by the Group,  but  other  certifications,  like  HQE  (France)  and BREEAM (UK), are also sought for projects where they are particularly  relevant.  Optimized  energy  performance,  the use of renewable energies and other energy conservation criteria are critical to obtaining green building certifications. In  2020,  Kering  also  launched  its  first  projects  to  obtain WELL  certification,  which  is  based  on  the  well-being  of building users.",

        "page_content": "More than 120 LEED certifications have been obtained by Kering and its Houses for their sites and stores, equal to more  than  97%  of  certifications  obtained  in  2021  and previously.  Around  50  further  certifications  are  in  the process of being obtained, almost exclusively LEED again.\n\n- - In  2021,  60  Gucci  stores  were  LEED  certified,  a  sharp increase relative to 2020. Alexander McQueen is actively seeking to obtain LEED v4 Gold or Platinum certification for  its  new  concept  stores,  while  Saint  Laurent  is continuing work to reduce the environmental impact of its  stores  on  the  basis  of  its  Golden  Rules  to  make  its stores  more  energy  efficient.  The  House  also  has 15  LEED  Platinum-certified  stores,  including  its  main flagship stores, and its Paris headquarters has BREEAM 'excellent' and HQE 'exceptional' certification. In 2021, eight new Balenciaga stores obtained LEED certification, including four LEED Platinum certifications in Asia.\n- - Balenciaga  has  set  up  a  specialist  leather  goods production site in Cerreto Guidi, Italy, which is currently undergoing  renovation.  This  process  falls  within  the framework of LEED certification for production facilities, meeting  the  same  requirements  as  LEED  certification for  stores.  The  Sustainability  team  is  involved  in monitoring  this  certification  process,  in  particular  by trying to incorporate  into  the  building  materials obtained from recycling its own scraps or unsold items. Meanwhile, Brioni has commissioned an energy audit of its  production sites, while Bottega Veneta's Montebello workshop  obtained  LEED  Platinum  certification  back in 2014, a first for the time.\n- - Kering's  US  operations  center  in  Wayne,  New  Jersey, opened in 2020, holds LEED gold certification, while the warehouses  and  offices  at  the  Trecate  logistics  hub in Italy have already obtained LEED platinum pre-certification,  with  the  offices  also  aiming  for  WELL certification.\n- 2. Establishing a Group-wide standard for stores.\n\nKering  has  been  working  since  2017  to  develop  a 'Standard for Stores' that sets out expected performance levels in 11 key areas. These include energy management, lighting, renewable energy, water use and waste treatment. The Standards cover all phases in a building's lifecycle,  namely  site  selection  and  relations  with  the lessor, design, construction or renovation, and operation. After a test phase at the Group's stores, the standard was officially published in 2020 to serve as a reference for new stores  and  store  renovations  where  the  use  of  LEED  or equivalent certifications is not possible. In 2021, particular effort was made to verify alignment with these standards  for  22  stores  in  France  and  12  in  the  United Kingdom.\n\nUlysse Nardin has signed up to the Swiss Energy Agency's energy conservation program, and  met  its  energy consumption  reduction  targets  several  years  ahead  of schedule at the Le Locle and La Chaux-de-Fonds sites. In the same way, Girard-Perregaux has continued to roll out its  energy  conservation  program  with  the  Swiss  Energy Agency. All sites use green electricity and are continuing to replace neon lights with LEDs. At the House's Numa-Droz site,  the  heating  and  air  conditioning  system  was  also renovated and replaced.\n\nLastly,  LED  technology  -  a  source  of  significant  energy savings  (up  to  90%  on  lighting)  -  continued  to  be  rolled out  by  all  of  the  Group's  Houses,  with  close  to  100% deployment  in  store  sales  areas,  where  the  most  light fittings  are  concentrated. In 2020 and 2021, efforts were focused on introducing LED lighting into store backrooms, offices,  warehouses  and  production  plants.  This  practice is  part  of  the  Kering  Standards  and  also  a  criterion  for\n\nobtaining  environmental  certifications  such  as  LEED, BREEAM and HQE. Some Houses are also gradually rolling out site energy consumption management tools (Building Management System for 45 Gucci stores, dedicated digital system at Saint Laurent) at their stores in order to make them more energy efficient (heating and air conditioning, ventilation, lighting, etc.).\n\n## Favoring renewable energy by producing it on site or purchasing renewable energy certificates\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  jointed  the  RE100  initiative  led  by  the Climate Group and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). As part of  this  initiative,  Kering  has  pledged  to  use  100%  renewable electricity by 2022.\n\nEach  year,  the  proportion  of  electricity  from  renewable sources  used  by  the  Group  increases,  reaching  92%  in  2021 thanks  to  increased  on-site  production  of  renewable  energy and the numerous green energy contracts implemented by the brands with the Group's support.\n\nFor  many  years,  Kering  has  encouraged  the  signing  of agreements to purchase locally produced green electricity, for all  sites  that  pay  their  power  invoices  directly  and  whenever the  local  electricity  market  allows.  For  regions  where  this practice  is  not  possible,  Kering  purchases  Energy  Attribute Certificates.  In  addition,  to  speed  up  the  energy  transition  in its host countries, the Group only purchases certificates from solar  or  wind  power  production  facilities  that  are  new  or relatively  recent  (less  than  ten  years  old).  Since  2019,  the Group has purchased green certificates for various countries in order to cover 100% of its energy consumption in those areas. The  geographical  breakdown  of  certificates  is  presented  in the methodological note available on the Group's website.\n\nElectricity  consumption  is  100%  renewable  in  43  countries and regions (Europe, Americas, South Africa and a large part of Asia).  At  Group  level,  this  represents  92.1%  (an  increase  of 1.5 points relative to 2020).\n\nAs  regards  the  Houses,  Brioni,  Qeelin  and  Girard-Perregaux now  use  100%  renewable  electricity.  For  all  Gucci  sites,  the share  of  renewable  electricity  reached  93%  in  2021.  It  was 83.7%  for  Bottega  Veneta,  86.7%  for  Balenciaga,  92.6%  for Saint  Laurent,  95.5%  for  Alexander  McQueen,  95.6%  for Boucheron and 99.3% for Kering Eyewear.\n\nOn top of external purchases, the brands have been boosting their  reliance  on  renewable  energy  generated  and  used  on site, for example by installing solar panels. Some Houses have already  installed  solar  equipment  on  the  roofs  of  their buildings, whether stores or workshops, such as Saint Laurent, Brioni and three Bottega Veneta sites in Italy. The solar panels supply  between  2%  and  4%  of  each  site's  power  needs. In  2020,  Gucci  installed  solar  panels  at  two  of  its  Italian headquarters,  in  Milan  and  Florence,  enabling  them  use  to green  electricity  on  site.  Kering  Eyewear  has  increased  its portion  of  renewable  energy  produced  on  site,  following  the installation in 2017 of a wind turbine that helps power parking lot lighting at its Padua headquarters in Italy. The turbine can produce up to 4,300 kWh per year. The plant in Sucy-en-Brie, France, also uses renewables, primarily geothermal and solar power,  thanks  to  solar  panels  and  heat  transfer  fluids.  The LEED-certified  warehouse  in  Vescovana,  Italy,  has  also  been fitted with solar panels, representing 15 kW of power. In 2021, the photovoltaic power system was completed at the Group's main logistics  hub  in  Trecate,  Italy.  The  system  has  nominal capacity  of  12.5  MW  and  is  the  biggest  rooftop  solar  power system  in  Italy  and  one  of  the  biggest  in  Europe.  Tests  are being  conducted  and  it  will  be  connected  to  the  grid  in early  2022,  increasing  the  proportion  of  energy  generated within  the  Group  from  4%  to  15%.  A  further  three  logistics warehouses also have panels in Switzerland, the United States and Dubai.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Mend\u00e8s ready-to-wear workshop in Angers, France,  which  belongs  to  Saint  Laurent,  has  used  biomass rather  than  gas  to  meet  its  heating  requirements,  and  since 2015,  using  green  energy  has  significantly  reduced  the  site's carbon footprint. In Paris, Saint Laurent's flagship stores and its  new  headquarters  are  all  fitted  with  the  Climespace  air conditioning  system.  This  urban  cooling  system  uses  water from  the  River  Seine  to  cool  buildings,  thereby  reducing electricity  consumption  and  CO2  emissions  compared  to conventional air conditioning systems.\n\n## Offsetting residual greenhouse gas emissions via carbon offset projects\n\n## Carbon offset projects\n\nAs  part  of  its  Net  Zero  commitment,  Kering  has  been supporting offsetting programs since 2012 via REDD+ projects. The  carbon  offsetting  (in  2021  in  respect  of  2020  CO2 emissions) of all of the Group's activities (Scopes 1 and 2 and part of Scope 3) and its supply chain (Scope 3), representing a total  of  1,779,888  TCO2  via  REDD+  certified  projects,  protects and  restores  sensitive  ecosystems  (forests,  wetlands,  coastal areas) as well as supporting green energy generation projects.\n\nIn  addition,  Kering  is  continuing  to  diversity  its  carbon offsetting approach to include other natural climate solutions, such  as  regenerative  farming  practices  that  enhance  carbon sequestration and mangrove restoration.\n\nSince  2020,  Kering  has  also  invested  in  Low  Carbon  Label projects, in partnership with IDELE (Institut de l'\u00c9levage) , which support  French  cattle  breeders  in  developing  more  carbonefficient practices.\n\nIn 2021, Gucci continued with its efforts to achieve its carbon neutrality  commitment  within  its  operations  and  its  supply chain, primarily through  its Natural Climate Solutions Portfolio.  The  House  maintained  its  support  programs  to protect and restore nature through REDD+ offsetting projects. These  projects  help  to  combat  climate  change  while  also having  a  positive  economic  and  social  impact  on  local communities,  as  well  as  protecting  flora  and  fauna.  This includes  protecting  undisturbed  land  by  means  of  'green carbon' offsetting projects and restoring forests and wetlands (mainly  mangroves)  through  'blue  carbon'  REDD+  projects, which are particularly  effective  for  carbon  sequestration  and storage. Gucci has also continued to roll out the regenerative agriculture  project  for  managing  agricultural  land  in  its  own supply chains and beyond.\n\nTo  get  as  many  businesses  as  possible  involved  in  tackling climate change, Gucci's CEO launched a challenge to his peers in all industries to encourage them to implement a corporate climate  strategy.  To  meet  the  Carbon  Neutral  Challenge, companies  must  avoid,  reduce,  restore  and,  as  a  last  resort, offset all emissions generated by their value chain, thanks to nature-based  solutions  that  help  protect  the  world's  critical ecosystems.\n\nThanks to its ISO 14064 certification, Bottega Veneta has been measuring and offsetting the CO2  emissions generated by its offices  in  Milan  since  2011,  and  its Montebello  Vicentino workshop  since  2015.  These  certifications  were  renewed in 2021 for 2019 and 2020.\n\n## Transportation-related emissions\n\n## Methodology\n\nTransportation-related  data  collected  under  the  reporting system is divided into three main categories:\n\n- \u00b7 BtoB  transportation:  this  includes  all  transportation  of goods  paid  for  by  the  brands  between  suppliers  and logistics  platforms  or  industrial  sites,  between  central logistics  platforms  and  local  distribution  centers  and  to points  of  sale  for  Europe.  The  transportation  of  goods between logistics centers also falls into this category. BtoB transportation  includes  road,  rail,  sea  and  air  freight. Express transportation includes goods delivered by express transportation service providers via road and air freight;\n- \u00b7 BtoC  transportation:  this  covers  all  deliveries  of  finished products between logistics platforms or points of sale and customers. These deliveries can be carried out either by the brands'  own  fleets  or  by  subcontractors'  vehicles.  For  the first time in 2021, to take account of the materiality of its environmental  impact,  Kering  worked  specifically  on measuring the carbon impact of its e-commerce activities. Transportation flows relating to these activities, similar to those  for  the  Group's  BtoB  operations,  are  presented separately  in  the  following  tables  and  comprise  both  air and road transport. They are also excluded from pro forma calculations  for  2021,  2020  and  2019  as  they  were  only measured for the first time in 2021;\n- \u00b7 business travel: this covers business air travel and the use of company cars.\n\nDetails  of  the  emission  factors  used  are  set  out  in  the environmental  reporting  methodological  note,  which  is available on the kering.com website.\n\n## Emissions related to transportation and travel\n\n## Transportation- and business travel-related CO2 emissions in 2021 (in metric tons of CO2)\n\n|                     | 2021    |\n|---------------------|---------|\n| BtoB transportation | 163,188 |\n| BtoC transportation | 73,103  |\n| Business travel     | 12,727  |\n| TOTAL               | 249,018 |\n\nBtoB transportation accounted for 66% of the Group's transportation-related emissions.",

Working  from  home  and widespread  use  of  digital  events  are  the  main  resources  for the reduction in business travel. 2021 was also affected by the many  restrictions  in  place,  which  impacted  international flights in particular. The carbon footprint relating to business travel therefore decreased by 69% between 2019 and 2021.\n\nTo limit the impact of travel by the employees of Kering and its  Houses  on  the  Group's  carbon  footprint,  the  Group  has incorporated  environmental  criteria  into  the  selection  of company  cars  and  is  gradually  increasing  the  number  of electric  vehicles  in  its  fleet.  As  a  result,  electric  and  hybrid vehicles account for more than 50% of Gucci's corporate fleet, and charging points are provided at all sites. Bottega Veneta is also  pursuing  the  renewal  of  its  fleet  with  the  inclusion  of hybrid and electric vehicles, which made up  46% of the fleet at the end of 2021 (77 vehicles). Pomellato, Dodo and Kering Eyewear are also including hybrid and electric vehicles in their fleets.  Kering  Corporate  offers  rechargeable  hybrid  vehicles and fully electric vehicles in each car category.\n\nThe Group's Houses are also developing alternatives to reduce work-related travel and encouraging employees to use public transport and green modes of transport, as well as car pooling:\n\n- \u00b7 In  2019,  a  joint  carpooling  initiative  was  launched  in  Italy between  certain  Houses'  and  Group's  sites.  The  aim  is  to reduce  transportation-related  emissions  by  encouraging employees to share their daily commute and the associated costs.  Ulysse  Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux  also  encourage car  pooling.  In  2021,  Gucci  set  up  a  car  pooling  service  at some of its sites in Italy, including outside working hours, while  Bottega  Veneta  joined  an  initiative  to  facilitate  car pooling among its Milan and Montebello office employees. The  Novara  production  site  in  Italy  has  for  several  years offered a fleet of shared vehicles.\n- \u00b7 Free  shuttles  have  been  made  available  to  employees between certain areas, for example between the Milan and Montebello  sites,  and  there  are  public  transport  networks serving Bottega Venetta, as well as between Saint Laurent's Paris stores and at Pomellato.\n- \u00b7 Use  of  bicycles  is  also  encouraged,  whether  by  creating bicycle parking facilities (Boucheron, Balenciaga and Kering Corporate), through subscription schemes (GirardPerregaux, Ulysse Nardin), or by setting up a fleet of electric bicycles for Saint Laurent employees to use free of charge, as well as for logistics teams.\n\n## Optimizing logistics flows and switching to alternative means of transportation\n\nGoods  transportation  represents  a  significant  part  of  the Group's CO2 emissions, which is why Kering works closely with its logistics platforms, its Houses and its carriers to reduce the distances  covered  during  supply  and  delivery,  to  optimize truck  and  aircraft  load  factors  and  the  environmental  and technical  performance  of  truck  fleets,  and  to  develop alternative  means  of  transportation  aimed  at  reducing  the Group's CO2 footprint.\n\nSince  2019,  Kering's  Logistics  Division  has  focused  on identifying  potential  improvement  avenues  in  terms  of measurement  and  monitoring  and  on  the  initiatives  to  be implemented  to  reduce  the  environmental  impact  of transportation. Projects to adapt Kering's logistics organization have enabled it to put environmental concerns at the heart of what it does. For example, it gives preference to the  most  efficient  vehicles  and  aircraft,  with  very  ambitious CO2 emissions standards (maximum of 600 g CO2 ton/km for air freight, the EURO 6 standard for road freight) and is making increasing use of alternative modes of transport for last-mile logistics.  Renewing  contracts  with  freight  operators  has  also provided  the  opportunity  to  share  Kering's  high  reporting standards. Each month, Kering will collect the carbon footprint of freight activities operated for the Group in accordance with the  EN  16258  global  standard.  Finally,  in  line  with  its  1.5\u00b0C target for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, Kering plans to define  carbon  reduction  trajectories  in  collaboration  with  its main freight operators compatible with its SBT target.\n\n- \u00b7 The following concrete measures were taken by the Houses in  2021:  Balenciaga  has  set  up  a  warehouse  close  to  its production  and  delivery  regions  to  avoid  sending  its products  by  air  over  long  distances.  The  House  also  gives priority  to  sea  freight,  which  has  a  lower  environmental impact  than  air  freight,  for  orders  that  do  not  require urgent delivery. Pomellato and Dodo also give preference to this  mode  of  transport  over  air  freight.  Saint  Laurent's logistics  fleet  is  made  up  exclusively  of  electric  vehicles. Gucci  has  also  introduced  measures  to  optimize  its  BtoB transportation  (itineraries,  loads,  functional  design)  and various stages of the supply chain, through to stores.\n- \u00b7 Kering  Eyewear  has  developed  an  approach  of  reverse logistics between its main hub in Italy and its Manufacture Kering Eyewear production plant. Each box delivered in one direction is reused for a return delivery, thereby limiting the number of empty journeys.\n- \u00b7 Finally,  optimizing  packaging  is  another  way  of  improving the  environmental  impact  of  logistics.  Kering's  logistics teams  are  therefore  working  actively  in  this  area  in partnership with the Houses.",

Scope  2  emissions  relating  to  electricity  and steam  consumption  were  further  reduced  relative  to  2020, representing  3.7%.  This  attests  to  the  progress  made  by  the Group in purchasing green electricity (with guarantee of origin) and use of  renewables  at  its  production  plants  and  logistics\n\nsites.  The increase in the largest portion of emissions, which are those not under the Group's control (Scope 3), reflects the post-pandemic  upturn  in  activity  as  well  the  updating  of carbon emission factors, with Scope 3 emissions at a higher level than in previous years.\n\n## Pro forma change vs. 2019 in CO2 emissions (in metric tons)\n\n|         | 2019-2021  pro forma  scope   | 2019-2021  pro forma  scope   | 2019-2021  pro forma  scope   |                 |\n|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n|         | 2021                          | 2020                          | 2019                          | Change vs. 2019 |\n| Scope 1 | 16,760                        | 12,856                        | 15,731                        | 6.5%            |\n| Scope 2 | 9,438                         | 10,266                        | 16,533                        | -42.9%          |\n| Scope 3 | 193,591                       | 141,855                       | 203,047                       | -4.7%           |\n| TOTAL   | 219,789                       | 164,977                       | 235,311                       | -6.6%           |\n\nOn a pro forma basis over three years, the Group's total emissions decreased by 6.6% thanks to greater use of electricity from renewable  sources.  This  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  Scope  2  emissions  and,  because  there  was  less  business  travel  by  air,  in Scope 3 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group's  industrial  water consumption is primarily attributable to its tanneries, none of which is located in water-stressed zones.\n\nMoreover, Kering is applying its EP&L approach to conduct an innovative review of responsible water management across its entire production chain. Indirect water consumption linked to the  use  of  agricultural  raw  materials  such  as  cotton  and extraction  of  precious  metals  is  a  serious  environmental concern.\n\n## Water consumption in 2021 and pro forma change vs. 2019 (in cu.m)\n\n|                      | Consumption   | 2019-2021  pro forma  scope   | 2019-2021  pro forma  scope   | 2019-2021  pro forma  scope   |                 |\n|----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                      | in 2021       | 2021                          | 2020                          | 2019                          | Change vs. 2019 |\n| Industrial water     | 335,010       | 286,619                       | 223,617                       | 339,760                       | -15.6%          |\n| Non-industrial water | 618,083       | 542,223                       | 446,290                       | 517,836                       | 4.7%            |\n| TOTAL WATER          | 953,093       | 828,842                       | 669,907                       | 857,596                       | -3.4%           |\n\nThe lower level of industrial water consumption is mainly due to  the  significant  reduction  in  consumption  at  one  of  the Group's sites.\n\nTotal  water  consumption  therefore  decreased  by  3.4%  on  a like-for-like basis between 2019 and 2021.\n\n## Policies and initiatives for reducing water consumption and management of wastewater\n\nGiven the nature of Kering's operations, the direct environmental  impact  of  its  water  consumption  is  not significant.  However,  the  Houses  still  work  tirelessly  to  come up  with  innovative  tanning  processes  that  eliminate  heavy metals  and  use  less  water.  As  a  result,  water  consumption intensity  (cubic  meters  of  industrial  water  consumed/Group revenue)  declined  by  26.8%  between  2019  and  2021.  For example,  Gucci's  Scrap-less  initiative  enables  the  House  to only treat the leather needed for product fabrication, thereby reducing  use  of  chemicals  and  water  consumption  (see section 4.2.2).\n\nBalenciaga gives priority to tanneries and denim suppliers that are making a genuine effort to reduce energy and water use in their treatment and finishing processes.\n\nAt Bottega Veneta's Montebello site, rainwater is collected for use  on  the  gardens  and  in  the  site's  fountains,  reducing  the House's  water  consumption  and  helping  it  obtain  LEED certification.  Aerators  have  been  fitted  to  faucets  at  various sites, resulting in a water saving of around 30%. At the Milan site,  rainwater  collection  is  supplemented  by  the  recovery  of used  water  from  the  air-conditioning  system,  resulting  in higher volumes of water collected, as well as energy recovery.\n\nAt  its  new  warehouse  in  Vescovana,  Kering  Eyewear  collects and filters rainwater for use in the site's lavatories and on its lawns.\n\nThough  the  water  discharge  impact  from  Kering's  directly owned operations is  not  significant  by  itself,  discharge  from textile  and  leather  industry  production  facilities  can  have  a more significant  environmental  impact,  especially  as  regards chemical pollutants. For this reason, water pollution is one of the  six  environmental  impacts  covered  by  the  Kering  EP&L. Because  of  the  large  amounts  of  water  used  by  tanneries, special  wastewater  treatment  measures  are  required.  Each tannery has its own on-site wastewater treatment plant. At all of  the  Group's  tanneries,  wastewater  is  pre-treated  on  site before  continuing  the  wastewater  treatment  process.  The Group's  two  Italian  tanneries  pre-treat  their  wastewater containing  chromium,  which  is  then  sent  to  a  special treatment  plant  used  by  several  other  tanneries,  which purifies  the  water  and  recovers  the  chromium.  The  Group's other two tanneries have treatment plants that use sedimentation and physicochemical and biological treatment techniques.  To  ensure  compliance  with  local  wastewater legislation, analyses are regularly carried out at each tannery and the results continuously monitored. If any anomalies are recorded,  dedicated  procedures  and  action  plans  are  put  in place  and,  where  applicable,  described  in  the  ISO  14001certified environmental management system.\n\nA total of 86% of water is discharged.\n\nWater management is an integral part of the Kering Standards, which set out guidelines for the Group's main manufacturing processes  (tanning,  textile  processing  and  leather  goods manufacturing).\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  are  also  implementing  measures  to reduce non-industrial water consumption, particularly at their headquarters and offices. Measures being rolled out at Gucci, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent and Kering include water fountains, filters, water-saving devices and rainwater harvesting systems at logistics sites.",

The use of this packaging relates directly to the Group's  operations.  To  limit  the  environmental  impact  of  its packaging, Kering and its Houses make every effort to opt for the most sustainable solutions available made from recycled or certified bio-sourced  materials.  They  also  carry  out initiatives  aimed  at  reducing  the  use  of  packaging  while guaranteeing  an  optimal  level  of  protection  for  the  goods\n\nmanufactured. The multi-brand logistics hub aims to reduce packaging  volumes  used  for  product  delivery  worldwide.  It works with the Houses to optimize their capacity and track the performance  of  packaging  used  for  BtoB  transportation.  It also  ensures  compliance  with  the  Kering  Standards  in  this regard. In addition, new machines have been installed in the Group's  warehouses  to  provide  made-to-measure  packaging for  orders  of  one  or  more  items,  reducing  both  packaging volumes and cardboard use. Warehouse employees are taught not  only  how  to  package  goods  correctly,  according  to  the Houses' requirements, but also how to choose the best type of packaging to optimize volume.\n\n## Packaging consumption in 2021 and change vs. 2019 (in metric tons)\n\n|                               | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | Change vs. 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|\n| Paper and cardboard packaging | 29,849 | 22,570 | 24,981 | 19.5%             |\n| Textiles                      | 2,552  | 2,961  | 2,733  | -6.6%             |\n| Plastics                      | 1,136  | 747    | 1,065  | 6.7%              |\n| Metals                        | 683    | 517    | 552    | 23.7%             |\n| Wood                          | 219    | 31     | 57     | 284.2%            |\n| Leather                       | 2      | 1      | 1      | 100%              |\n| Other materials               | 63     | -      | -      | /                 |\n| TOTAL PACKAGING               | 34,504 | 26,827 | 29,389 | 17.4%             |\n\nThe increase between 2019 and 2021 was due to the upturn in activity and higher sales volumes. The blockchain technology used by one House in particular has allowed for more detailed reporting, which explains the increase in reported leather and metal consumption. Finally, the increase in wood volumes is due to the higher level of watch and jewelry production, for which boxes are made primarily from wood.\n\n## Paper and cardboard packaging\n\nIn 2021, the proportion of certified or recycled packaging was over 91% for paper and cardboard packaging.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, 37% of plastic packaging was recycled or bio-based.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Textile packaging\n\n## In 2021, the proportion of organic or recycled textiles was close to 63%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures to promote more sustainable packaging\n\nA  Kering  Standard  dedicated  to  packaging  was  developed  in 2020,  setting  out  the  eco-design  principles  that  should  be applied  to  packaging  in  order  to  improve  its  environmental impact.  The  principles  revolve  around  the  following  areas: reduction  (of  weight  and  volume),  reuse,  recycling  and incorporation of responsible materials (recycled, bio-sourced and  certified).  The  standard  notably  aims  to  eliminate single-use plastics and problem plastics like PVC. To facilitate employee understanding and buy-in, the Packaging Standard was presented to employees of Kering and its Houses during webinars  on  topics  like  bio-based  plastics  and  e-commerce packaging.\n\nMost of the Houses favor FSC certification for their paper and cardboard packaging, as well as recycled paper:\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci  has  been  an  FSC  member  since  2017.  All  printed packaging  and  materials  it  uses  for  BtoB  and  BtoC  have been FSC-certified since 2010. In 2020, Gucci launched its new  Gucci  Green  Packaging  range  for  products  bought  in stores and online. All paper and cardboard in this range has obtained  the  FSC  Mix  label.  Production  of  this  paper  and cardboard  packaging  requires  less  ink  and  it  can  also  be recycled as there is no coating.\n- \u00b7 Saint  Laurent  also  uses  only  FSC-certified  paper  and  has implemented  recycling  systems  at  all  of  its  offices  and stores for recycling paper and cardboard.\n- \u00b7 All  of  Alexander  McQueen's  and  Brioni's  BtoC  paper  and cardboard  packaging  is  also  FSC-certified,  as  well  as  the majority of Brioni's BtoB packaging.\n- \u00b7 At Balenciaga, all primary and secondary paper packaging is made from 40% post-consumer recycled paper.\n\nOrganic or recycled textiles are also favored by the Houses. For example,  the  ribbons  on  Alexander  McQueen  shopping  bags are made from GOTS-certified linen, and its protective apparel bags  are  made  from  GOTS-certified  organic  cotton.  At  Gucci, the  handles  of  shopping  bags  in  the  Gucci  Green  Packaging range  are  made  from  100%  recycled  polyester  and  can  be removed, which makes them easier to recycle. Dust bags are made  from  regenerated  cotton  and  recycled  polyester,  and ribbons are made from 100% organic cotton.\n\nLastly, the Houses pay special attention to the packaging used for  e-commerce.  This  is  the  case  for  Alexander  McQueen, which  in  2021  conducted  a  joint  study  with  the  Trecate logistics  warehouse  into  reducing  e-commerce  packaging volumes. At Balenciaga, shipping boxes have been adapted to perfectly fit the House's packaging, thereby limiting the use of raw materials and reducing shipping volumes. In 2019, Saint Laurent developed new packaging for its e-commerce site that can  be  transported  folded,  thereby  reducing  the  space  used and in turn CO2 emissions during transportation. At Gucci, the e-commerce range consists of reusable cotton packaging and filling made from FSC Mix certified paper.\n\n## Single-use plastics\n\nIn  2019,  within  the  framework  of  the  Fashion  Pact,  Kering made a commitment to stop  using  single-use  plastics  in  its client  packaging  (BtoC)  by  2025  and  its  logistics  packaging (BtoB)  by  2030.  Kering  believes  that  getting  rid  of  single-use plastics across the industry as a whole is a priority and has set even more ambitious internal targets. In 2021, the purchasing and sustainability departments led a taskforce involving all of the  Houses  on  working  towards  this  goal.  The  project consisted  of  sharing  joint  definitions  for  BtoC  and  BtoB packaging, identifying single-use plastics within business lines and implementing alternatives through pilot schemes. As use of  plastic  has  already  been  significantly  reduced  in  BtoC packaging,  the  Group's  teams  have  focused  in  particular  on ready-to-wear BtoB packaging, identifying the various movements  in  the  supply  chain  (from  plant  to  distribution center  to  store)  and  BtoB  packaging  corresponding  to  these movements.  A  number  of  Group  divisions  are  trialling alternatives such as reusable packaging, alternative materials such  as  paper,  and  even  packaging  containing  recycled material that is itself 100% recyclable.\n\nAll  of  the  Houses  are  involved  in  this  drive,  in  collaboration with  the  Group,  in  order  to  find  solutions  for  their  BtoB packaging. Gucci, for example, no longer uses plastic in its ecommerce  and  retail  packaging  but  waterproof  cardboard, paper ribbons and even cotton tote bags. For its e-commerce activities,  the  House has replaced all plastics with paper and external packaging has also been optimized. The proportion of bio-based  or  recycled  plastics  used  within  the  Group  rose from  21%  to  37%  between  2019  and  2021.  For  example, in 2021, Gucci hangers were made from recycled polystyrene, while  those  at  Bottega  Veneta  were  made  from  recycled plastic. In addition, Kering Eyewear is also trialing alternatives to the packaging used to protect eyewear during storage and shipping, in particular packaging made from paper.\n\nGucci  is  also  stepping  up  what  it  demands  of  its  suppliers. With its Take Back program for plastic protective boxes for its accessories,  Gucci  has  avoided  producing  an  additional 336,000  boxes,  equal  to  40  tons  of  plastic  avoided  for  BtoB packaging.\n\nSaint Laurent is also working on incorporating 100% recycled and reusable polybags into the supply chain, which will apply to the brand's clothing as of the Spring 2022 collections.\n\nBalenciaga's polybags now contain 66% recycled plastic, while its apparel bags are made from 100% recycled PET.",

The repackaging of goods and the use of pallets for transportation mostly generate non-hazardous waste.  Kering  mainly  generates  packaging  waste  and  also small quantities of hazardous waste, corresponding to specific items of waste on production sites and other waste produced mainly in stores and offices (lighting, ink cartridges, etc.).\n\nThe main source of the Group's hazardous waste production is its  industrial  operations,  and  more  particularly  its  tanneries. One  of  the  main  challenges  for  Kering's  waste  management operations  is  the  presence  of  heavy  metals,  which  are  used during  the  tanning  process.  Kering's  tanneries  are  therefore actively involved in the research and development of alternative tanning methods that are more environmentally friendly. As a result, a heavy metal-free tanning method has made available at  the  Group's  exotic  and  non-exotic  leather  tanneries  and lifecycle  assessments  have  been  carried  out  to  confirm  the improvement  in  environmental  impact  associated  with  the new process, which does not use chromium or heavy metals.\n\nTanning processes can also give rise to odor pollution because they  emit  hydrogen  sulfide,  especially  at  the  stripping  stage. Unpleasant odors are managed by an air evacuation system at the stripping tubs, which channels polluted air through a filter that traps sulfur bearing particles and outputs clean air.\n\n## Total waste produced in 2021 and pro forma change vs. 2019 (in metric tons)\n\n|                                  | Production   | 2019-2021  pro forma  scope   | 2019-2021  pro forma  scope   | 2019-2021  pro forma  scope   |                 |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                  | in 2021      | 2021                          | 2020                          | 2019                          | Change vs. 2019 |\n| Non-hazardous waste              | 20,452       | 16,549                        | 14,140                        | 19,333                        | -14.4%          |\n| Of which recycled  and recovered | 77.1%        | 75.6%                         | 70.5%                         | 66.7%                         |                 |\n| Hazardous waste (1)              | 645          | 455                           | 457                           | 611                           | -25.5%          |\n| Of which recycled  and recovered | 46.2%        | 38.2%                         | 26.0%                         | 24.9%                         |                 |\n| TOTAL WASTE                      | 21,097       | 17,004                        | 14,597                        | 19,944                        | -14.7%          |\n| Of which recycled  and recovered | 76.2%        | 74.6%                         | 69.1%                         | 65.4%                         |                 |\n\nIn  2021,  97%  of  the  waste  generated  by  the  Group  was  non-hazardous  waste.

Paper  and  packaging  has  been collected and recycled at its offices for a number of years.\n\n## Waste recycling rate in 2021 (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2011, Balenciaga adopted waste sorting at its main sites in Paris.  The  brand  works  with  an  ESAT  (a  company  working  in the  protected  sector  [supporting  people  with  disabilities]  in France) specializing in the recovery and  recycling of conventional  office  waste  (paper,  envelopes,  flyers,  etc.),  as well as cardboard, plastic, cans and fabric (such as scraps from the brand's studio and workshops).\n\nIn 2021, Saint Laurent continued to roll out a comprehensive recycling  program  across  its  industrial  sites,  headquarters, stores and showroom. In line with each country's regulations, Gucci  also  ensures  the  appropriate  management  of  waste from its stores, giving priority to the separation and recycling of  key  components  such  as  paper,  cardboard  and  plastic. Pomellato  also  pays  particular  attention  to  waste  recycling, while  Girard-Perregaux  and  Ulysse  Nardin  provide  special waste-sorting bins (for cups, paper, cardboard, etc.). Recycling points have also been provided at the La Chaux de Fonds and Le Locle industrial sites.\n\nAll  these  initiatives  are  carried  out  with  the  help  of  local recycling companies. Saint Laurent continued work during the year  on  a  comprehensive  recycling  program  at  its  industrial sites,  headquarters,  stores  and  showrooms.  The  House  also maintained  its  numerous  partnerships  with  social  impact companies,  such  as Emma\u00fcs offshoot Le  Relais for  all  used fabrics and uniforms, and Atelier du Bocage for used electronic equipment and ink cartridges, as well as Tissons La Solidarit\u00e9 , a solidarity network that sorts second-hand clothing, and then sews and resells recycled garments. The House equips its sites -  particularly  its  headquarters  -  using  recycled  materials, such  as  insulation  panels  made  using  fabrics  from  old\n\ncollections.  Alexander  McQueen  also  uses  circular  economy principles  in  its  approach,  by  systematically  sorting  waste fabrics  in  its  creative  studios.  It  has  also  brought  its  stores onboard: 60% of them sort recyclable materials.\n\nOn the basis of a circular economy-led approach, a number of other  partnerships  have  been  established  in  order  to  find sustainable solutions for recycling waste relating to production activities, in particular textiles (see section 5.2.1.3).\n\nThe  Houses  pay  special  attention  to  decorative  items  and point-of-sale (POS) materials during store cleaning or closure programs, for example. The teams at Alexander McQueen, for instance,  choose  service  providers  that  can  comply  with  the new Kering Standards. Furniture from its relocated stores will be  taken  to  a  recycling  center  for  conversion  and  reuse.  A similar  approach  is  taken  at  Brioni.  During  an  inventory cleanup program, the House developed a plan with all regions to donate or recycle decorative items and POS materials. As a result, all items were recycled in Japan and pieces of furniture were donated to a local school in Hong Kong. Boucheron has a set up a recycling project known as Vendorama in collaboration with  non-profit  organization  ArtStock,  which  recycles  stage set  and  decorative  elements  for  reuse  on  the  arts  circuit.  In 2021,  Ulysse  Nardin  took  part  in  the  Mat\u00e9riuum  upcycling project, giving a second life to the House's furniture and POS materials.\n\nBoucheron and Alexander McQueen, as well as Kering Eyewear, have distributed reusable cups and bottles to employees at a number of sites and regions to limit use of plastic bottles and cups. Kering Eyewear has also introduced microfiltered water fountains  to  its  offices  in  Italy  and  works  with  a  specialized service  provider  to  organize  the  collection  of  all  production waste containing its flagship material acetate. New initiatives were  also  trialed  and  rolled  out  in  2020  and  2021  at  the Group's  headquarters  and  at  the  Balenciaga  headquarters  in Paris  and  at  Saint  Laurent,  such  as  collection  of  single-use face masks for recycling, reusable returnable packaging at the company  canteen  with La Consigne  Greengo, and  the introduction of Auum, an innovative machine that cleans and disinfects  cups  in  10  seconds  without  chemicals.  These measures will help to achieve the target of zero waste at the Group's offices.\n\nMeasures are also being taken on a local level to combat food waste,  such  as  Saint  Laurent's  and  Balenciaga's  partnerships with  waste  and  compost  recovery  specialists  Linkee  and Les Alchimistes ,  particularly  during  the  showroom  period.  Gucci's has  been  involved  in  the  Siticibo  initiative  in  collaboration with Banco  Alimentare since  2011,  which  also  partners  with Pomellato  and  DoDo,  and  Bottega  Veneta  is  involved  in  the Food for People project.",

        "page_content": "## 4 BUILDING TOGETHER ENVIRONMENTALLY AND SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAINS\n\n## Focus on: our vision of responsible sourcing\n\n## Managing our impacts beyond our own operations: an approach based on transparency and traceability\n\nKering believes that sustainability can only exist within a strict ethical framework. The Group is aware that its social and environmental responsibility goes beyond its own operations and extends throughout its supply chains. It further believes that  respect  for  human  rights  applies  to  everyone,  be  they  employees,  workers  in  supply  chains  or  members  of  local communities, the main keys documented in the Group's Code of Ethics and human rights policy.\n\nThe result is a need for transparency and traceability within its supply chains of its key raw materials - and therefore to identify, understand and map those chains - with a view to developing synergies and priority programs wherever significant impacts  are  found.  In  operating  terms,  this  vision  is  expressed  in  the  two  strategic  management  tools  implemented  by Kering: the EP&L, which measures its environmental impacts across its various supply chains, even outside the regulatory framework, and the Kering Standards.\n\nThe  Kering  Standards  lay  down  the  Group's  requirements  in  terms  of  traceability  for  the  key  raw  materials  used  by  the Houses  (see  section  4.1.1).  The  overall  level  of  traceability  is  consolidated  annually  through  the  EP&L  tool.  The  level  of traceability required by type of material was set on the basis of a risk matrix for each type of raw material, as well as the level of transparency achievable by the market. The origin of the raw materials is established by supplier declaration, and may be supplemented by specific protocols including certification (such as ICEC for leather) and verification by the Houses. In  addition to audits, the Houses use various technologies to trace the path from the extraction of raw materials to the intermediate production stages and then into their own operations and finally into stores. These technologies include RFID and NFC chips, blockchain, mechanical marking of hides, and forensic technology.\n\nThe Group's responsible sourcing policy is also based on key principles defined in its Code of Ethics and Suppliers' Charter, as well as the Sustainability Principles to be respected by suppliers. Furthermore, in 2021, Kering set up its online 'supplier portal' in order to involve suppliers in the Group's targets and requirements with regard to sustainability (see section 4.1.2).\n\n## 4.1 Relations with our direct suppliers and subcontractors (Tier 1 and Tier 2)\n\n## 4.1.1 Responsible purchasing policy: principles and key documents\n\n## 4.1.1.1 Suppliers' Charter\n\nSince  2013,  the  Group's  Code  of  Ethics  has  included  the Suppliers'  Charter,  which  sets  out,  in  detail,  Kering's  specific expectations  of  its  commercial  partners  in  respect  of  social and  environmental  issues.  For  any  supplier  wanting  to  work with  Kering  or  one  of  its  Houses,  notwithstanding  any contractual  clauses,  compliance  with  the  Charter  is  a precondition of the business relationship. The Group requires its  suppliers  to  commit  formally  to  applying  high  ethical standards  themselves  and  to  ensuring  the  preservation  of human rights.\n\nThe  Charter  reminds  them  of  the  need  to  promote  human rights within their production  units  and  among  their subcontractors, and to advise Kering and/or its Houses of any serious  difficulties  in  applying  the  Charter.  Compliance  is further  measured  by  means  of  social  audits  in  production sites, as described in section 4.1.3.\n\nThe Suppliers' Charter, as an integral part of the Code of Ethics, was  revised  in  2018  and  circulated  in  2019.  A  plan  for reaching  the  employees  of  Kering's  and  its  Houses'  direct suppliers was also rolled out in 2020 and updated in 2021 (see section 2.3).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.1.1.2 Sustainability Principles applicable to suppliers\n\nIn addition, the Sustainability Principles are divided into three areas:\n\n- \u00b7 the social aspects related to human rights, labor rights, and health and safety, including the elimination of child labor, forced  labor,  human  trafficking  in  all  its  forms  and discrimination,  compliance  with  statutory  working  hours, and respect for the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining;\n- \u00b7 environmental  aspects,  such  as  compliance  with  laws  as well  as  restrictive  lists  of  chemicals  defined  by  Kering, environmental management, and waste water treatment;\n- \u00b7 aspects  related  to  the  supply  of  raw  materials  and packaging, including respect for animal welfare and the five related  freedoms,  sourcing  and  traceability  requirements for  a  number  of  key  materials  used  by  Kering,  and  the prohibition  of  certain  substances  and/or  certain  sourcing regions  (for  reasons  related  to  the  social  conditions  of production  -  child  or  forced  labor,  for  instance  -  or environmental issues).\n\nThis document provides details of these mandatory principles imposed by international and national laws, as well as those embodying Kering's additional expectations and best practices. They also make reference to conventions, agreements  and  major  international  texts,  for  which  they represent  a  practical  extension  (ILO  and  United  Nations Conventions,  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business and  Human  Rights,  Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment, Ramsar Convention, etc.).\n\nThese sustainability principles have been phased into supplier contracts  since  2016,  in  addition  to  the  Suppliers'  Charter. Each  supplier  is  in  turn  tasked  with  passing  on  these principles to its own subcontractor network, if it has one. The principles are available to the public on the Group's website. In  2021,  these  principles  were  updated  to  reflect  Kering's increasing requirements, in parallel with changes to the Kering Standards.\n\n## 4.1.1.3 Responsible purchasing policy for non-market purchases\n\nFor  non-retail  (indirect)  purchases,  the  Group's  Indirect Purchasing  Department  remains  committed  to  responsible sourcing based on a reciprocal undertaking with suppliers to respect  the  Kering  Code  of  Ethics.  It  also  has  specific commitments  tailored  to  each  category  of  purchases,  with buyers identifying the most relevant sustainability criteria. To formalize  this  process,  a  responsible  purchasing  policy  has been implemented at Group level.\n\nIt sets out the priorities to be shared and applied by all Group employees to manage purchasing ethically and responsibly. It has been distributed to all Kering employees. Today, all buyers are  trained  and  made  aware  of  responsible  purchasing practices, and all purchases include CSR selection specifications and/or criteria.\n\nKering  further  formalized  these  commitments  in  2014  by signing the 'Responsible Supplier Relations' Charter issued by the  French  Ministry  of  the  Economy  and  Finance,  and  the Compagnie  des  Dirigeants  et  Acheteurs  de  France (French purchasing managers body - CDAF). The Charter's purpose is to promote the implementation of and compliance with best practices in relation to suppliers in France and to encourage the  major  signatory  companies  to  implement  a  progressoriented  approach  with  their  suppliers,  especially  small  and medium-sized  enterprises,  in  order  to  develop  a  true partnership  through  mutual  knowledge  and  respect  for  each party's rights and duties.\n\n## 4.1.1.4 Kering Standards for Raw Materials and Manufacturing Processes and their distribution\n\nIn  2012,  Kering  set  out  basic  principles  and  guidelines  on responsible sourcing, known as the Kering Standards. A first in the luxury industry, the Standards were published in 2018 and can  be  downloaded  in  English,  Italian  and  French  from  the Group's website.\n\nThe Standards set out the criteria imposed on the Group and its  suppliers  in  five  key  areas:  traceability,  use  of  chemicals, social  impact,  environmental  impact  and  animal  welfare, describing the minimum requirements for Group suppliers in each  of  these  five  areas,  as  well  as  the  more  demanding requirements that suppliers will have to meet by 2025. They are based  on  founding  notions  of  integrity  (material traceability, chain of custody certification, etc.), circularity (use of  recycled  materials  where  possible,  consideration  of  the recyclability of products, etc.) and the precautionary principle (no use of GMOs, no nano-materials, etc.).\n\nThe Kering Standards cover:\n\n- \u00b7 the key raw materials used by the Group, representing more than 95% of purchasing volumes, namely leather and precious skins, fur alternatives, wool, cashmere, cotton, silk, synthetic fibers,  paper,  wood,  plastic,  feathers  and  down,  cellulosic fibers, gold, diamonds, colored gemstones and silver;\n- \u00b7 the Group's main production processes, namely tanning, the various stages of textile manufacture, leather work and shoes;\n- \u00b7 since  2020:  packaging,  visual  tools  and  innovation  for sustainable production;\n- \u00b7 since 2021: logistics (warehousing and transportation) and rules for managing products at the end of their lifecycle.",

for animals throughout the supply chain. These Standards are the  first  ever  set  of  full  animal  welfare  standards  for  luxury and  fashion  and  aim  to  drive  positive  change  in  industry practices,  and  beyond.  They  cover  all  the  species  that  are  a part  in  the  Group's  supply  chains  around  the  world,  namely cattle  and  calves,  sheep,  goats,  ostriches,  crocodiles  and alligators  and  pythons.  For  each  species,  the  open-source Standards  highlight  the  specific  challenges,  laying  down breeding,  transportation  and  slaughtering  requirements,  and provide  the  list  of  existing  benchmark  certifications.  In addition to this multi-species document, Kering has published\n\nmore  detailed  individual  Standards  for  cattle,  calves,  sheep and goats, as well as guidelines for slaughterhouses. In 2021, these Standards were updated to reflect changes in practices and experience from visits and audits within our value chains. NGOs such as CIWF, Welfarm and OABA took part in the public consultation and contributed to this update.\n\nThe  Kering  Standards  are  circulated  within  the  Houses  by means of dedicated training programs provided for suppliers by the Houses and Materials Innovation Lab. They also serve as a  reference framework for assessing suppliers with regard to sustainability aspects via the Vendor Portal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  environmental aspect grew out of the lessons drawn from the EP&L approach and  the  predominant  role  played  by  supply  chains  (Tiers  1 to  4)  in  the  Group's  environmental  impact:  without  suppliers sharing Kering's commitment and belief in the need for action, potential improvements would be limited.\n\nThe  Group  therefore  acts  at  several  levels,  as  a  Group  and within  each  of  its  Houses,  individually  or  collectively,  rolling out  training  and  awareness  programs  as  well  as  assessment mechanisms.\n\n## 4.1.2.1 Monitoring and assessing suppliers' CSR performance (Vendor Portal)\n\nIn  line  with  the  objective  of  creating  a  'Supplier  Sustainability Index'  and  ensuring  its  Standards  are  implemented  by  all suppliers  by  2025,  Kering  designed  and  implemented  a  new supplier portal in 2020, which can be accessed online. It serves as a Vendor Rating System and a means of sharing information and best practices in terms of sustainability. This portal allows for the ongoing  assessment,  by  means  of  dedicated,  comprehensive questionnaires of up to 300 questions (see also section 2.5), of implementation of the Kering Standards across the supply chain, environmental performance  and  social  performance.  This information is used to calculate CSR performance indicators for suppliers and to define the scope of new projects.\n\nIn 2021, 11 training sessions were provided for 650 suppliers. Following an initial pilot project in 2020, Kering has stepped up its process for collecting environmental and employee information from its suppliers. The various indicators analyzed include:\n\n- \u00b7 to date, more than 500 suppliers representing around 70% of purchasing in the ready-to-wear, leather goods and shoes categories have completed the three questionnaires, making a self-assessment of their performance via the portal;\n- \u00b7 all  respondents  acknowledge  that  they  know  the  Group's requirements  (Code  of  Ethics  and  Suppliers'  Charter,  MRSL and PRSL, Kering Standards);\n\n- \u00b7 the percentage of women in the workforce is 56.6% (based on replies from 535 suppliers);\n- \u00b7 manufacturing sites state that they mainly buy energy from renewable sources; around one quarter generate energy on site.\n\nIn  addition  to  rolling  out  the  portal  to  a  growing  number  of suppliers,  the  Houses  are  also  committed  to  helping  their suppliers, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 Following  on  from  the  measures  taken  with  tanneries in  2019  and  2020,  Bottega  Veneta  has  conducted  eight audits of their slaughterhouses' practices. Saint Laurent has developed  a  set  of  specific  Key  Performance  Indicators (KPIs)  for  its  supplier  evaluation  system  in  its  leather tanneries (see section 4.2.2).\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  Saint  Laurent  also  launched  a  project  with Balenciaga for their denim suppliers in Japan to assess the environmental performance of the various members of the supply  chain  (Tier  1,  Tier  2  and  Tier  3)  and  help  them  to improve  their  practices  with  regard  to  water  and  energy consumption,  waste  management,  wastewater  treatment and  management  of  chemical  products  (application  of Kering's MRSL and PRSL). The project will continue in 2022 with site visits, analysis, operational recommendations and a follow-up.\n- \u00b7 Gucci  also  assesses  its  suppliers  of  all  its  business  units through  dedicated  questionnaires  covering  the  various aspects of their CSR approach: certifications and management systems  in  place,  understanding  of  the  Kering  Standards, water and energy consumption, carbon footprint, waste and chemical  product  management,  gender  equality  and employee  well-being.  The  KPIs  have  been  defined  in  line with  the  Kering  Standards,  traceability  requirements  and the  MRSL,  as  well  as  with  suppliers'  maturity  in  terms  of sustainability.  The  Gucci  Sustainability  Principles  set  out the  Houses'  requirements  on  top  of  the  Kering  Group's Suppliers'  Charter  and  its  Sustainability  Principles  (see section 4.1.1).\n- \u00b7 Ulysse  Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux  have  mapped  out  the proportion of recycled materials used by their key suppliers (steel, brass, titanium). Two dedicated workshops were then held with these suppliers to share the lessons learned.\n\nThe Group and its Houses also encourage - wherever relevant, particularly with respect to the size of suppliers - the use of certifications  in  internationally  recognized  standards  for environmental  management  systems  (e.g.  ISO  14001),  labor relations (SA8000), and health and safety (ISO 45001).",

In  2021,  with  the  restrictions related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  most  supplier  training programs were held virtually.\n\nAlexander  McQueen  held  a  Sustainability  Summit  with  its suppliers  in  July  2021.  It  included  a  presentation  of  the House's  Sustainability  strategy  and  the  Kering  Standards, looking  to  support  suppliers  in  the  adoption  of  more sustainable practices. It has  also  introduced  incentive mechanisms  to  develop  long-term  partnerships  and  offers dedicated  training  programs  for  its  buyers  and  R&D  staff  on sustainability and the Kering Standards.\n\nIn  addition  to  meetings  devoted  to  exchanges  and  collective development,  Kering  also  supports  its  suppliers  in  the practical  implementation  of  projects  aimed  at  reducing  its environmental footprint, such as the Clean By Design project, described  in  section  4.1.4,  actions  implemented  by  logistics teams  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  their  activities,  and programs developed specifically in cooperation with stakeholders  in  the  various  key  raw  materials  industries,  as described in section 4.2.2.\n\nKering  continued  its  partnership  with  the  Zero  Discharge  of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) program and other luxury brands to  unite  textile  and  leather  suppliers  around  the  notion  of\n\nproactive  management  of  chemicals  and  the  application  of the Manufacturing Restricted Substance List (MRSL). In 2021, Kering  was  actively  involved  in  promoting  the  ZDHC  Supplier To  Zero  program  within  its  supply  chain  in  Italy.  A  total  of 89  Italian  companies  supplying  Kering,  representing  46%  of raw  materials  purchasing  (leather  and  fabrics)  and  57%  of finished products bought for the Group's ready-to-wear items and  accessories,  took  part  in  the  ZDHC  Supplier  To  Zero webinar. Furthermore, since 2014, Kering has provided active support  for  its  key  suppliers  in  the  leather  (tanneries  and suppliers in charge of production), textiles and finished product categories  in  ready-to-wear  and  accessories  to  encourage them to comply with the MRSL, offering implementation tools and training.\n\nThe  Group  and  its  Houses,  including  Balenciaga,  Boucheron and  Saint  Laurent,  are  also  committed  to  working  with organizations  in  the  social  and  solidarity  economy  (SSE), particularly  through  contracts  for  on-site  services  or  pilot projects. Brioni has also formed a partnership with Colori Vivi Sartoria, a positive social impact tailoring workshop that helps refugee women and mothers obtain professional qualifications, for  the  production  of  certain  items.  Bottega  Veneta  is  also working on obtaining suppliers from cooperative organizations through  seven  projects  with  a  significant  social  impact, including  two  pilot  projects  launched  in  2021,  for  example concerning  the  removal  and  reuse  of  leather  from  unsold bags.\n\n## Focus on: Kering's project on gender equality in the supply chain in Italy with the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana\n\nWith the goal of working towards gender equality within their supply chains, Kering and its Houses - Gucci, Kering Eyewear, Pomellato and Saint Laurent, under the leadership of Bottega Veneta - in collaboration with the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI), get their suppliers to make a commitment to supporting diversity and gender equality. This project has resulted in:\n\n- \u00b7 the publication in 2019 of the first ever study into the role of women in the supply chains of the Italian luxury industry. Compiled with three specialist associations (BSR, Valore D and Wise Growth), the study highlighted the challenges faced by women working in the industry and issued practical recommendations for improving gender equality. It identified four priority focuses: working conditions and economic opportunities, leadership and career advancement, motherhood, and workplace conduct and harassment;\n- \u00b7 introduction  of  a  phygital  event  for  suppliers  organized  during  Milan  Fashion  Week  in  September  2020.  The  event brought together 200 suppliers to discuss the theme of gender equality, showing how the issue is an asset in terms of resilience and innovation in the current crisis, and offering the chance for more in-depth training;\n- \u00b7 a  series  of  10  trainings  sessions  for  key  suppliers  of  the  Houses  (covering  all  job  roles)  between  late  2020  and  2021. These sessions looked at the issues of women's empowerment at work, work-life balance and self-awareness;\n- \u00b7 in fall 2021, an assessment of the effects of this training showed a 15% reduction in prejudices about the role of women in the  workplace  and  a  25%  improvement  in  participants'  wellbeing  at  work.  Kering  intends  to  continue  these  trainings in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following initiatives in particular are worth noting:\n\n- \u00b7 careful monitoring of the financial impact of the crisis on the Group's suppliers;\n- \u00b7 strict compliance by the Group with all contract terms and conditions, particularly payment terms, with prepayment or reverse factoring solutions implemented for some suppliers;\n- \u00b7 establishment of local initiatives, in Italy for instance, in association with public authorities and professional bodies, to provide  advice  and  support,  and  ensure  that  suppliers  were  properly  informed  about  what  protective  and  emergency measures  to  adopt,  particularly  for  the  health  and  safety  of  their  employees,  but  also  about  government  assistance measures in place.\n\nIn 2021, Gucci continued its partnership with bank Intesa Sanpaolo, which was renewed and extended in 2020 to smaller companies in its supply chain in Italy, to provide quick access to loans on attractive terms. Gucci's support allowed these companies, which supply the Italian House with leather, textiles, jewelry and accessories, and between them represent more than  20,000  jobs,  to  benefit  from  conditions  reserved  for  large  groups,  at  reasonable  interest  rates.  Gucci  and  Intesa SanPaolo see the program, known as Sviluppo filiere , as a means of providing support to 'Made in Italy' production chains by enabling  these  SMEs  to  survive  the  emergency  stemming  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  to  finance  their  growth, international development and the resumption of work at production sites. More than 175 of Gucci's suppliers have been able to benefit from loans under this partnership, representing a total of more than \u20ac286 million.\n\nAt the same time, the social audits conducted include new questions related to the pandemic in the assessment and on-site verification questionnaires, particularly on health and safety measures implemented to protect suppliers' employees.\n\nLastly,  in  November  2020,  Kering  teams  tasked  with  centralizing  the  management  and  assessment  of  suppliers  for  the brands carried out a study focusing exclusively on the health crisis among more than 1,500 of the brands' direct suppliers. Over 80% of suppliers contacted responded to the study, conducted anonymously online, thereby providing the Group with precise data on the extent and repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by suppliers to deal with it. The results were shared with each House to give each of them a vision of the overall health of their suppliers and enable them to be vigilant and provide support where necessary. The study was repeated in April 2021 on over 1,500 suppliers, with a participation rate of around 80%. Covering the period from November 2020 to April 2021, the results of the study show that the second and third waves had a less significant impact on suppliers, which may be related to changes in restrictions set by governments in the different countries in which suppliers are located.\n\n## 4.1.3.1 Implementation of the social audit system within the Group\n\nNo control system, regardless of how mature and tested it is, can guarantee the absence of risk, and it is up to the Group and its Houses to develop the most efficient collaborative and control  systems  with  suppliers  in  order  to  keep  risk  to  a minimum and implement any corrective action in cases where non-compliance is identified.\n\nSince 2016, the Group has had a single central body allowing Kering to control the compliance  of  Group  suppliers, combining  audit  and  risk  assessment  practices.  The  new organization, the Hercules system, is based on six key pillars:\n\n- 1. the Sustainability Principles established for all the Luxury Houses in 2015, which are divided into three areas: social aspects related to human rights, labor rights, and health and safety; environmental aspects; and aspects related to raw  materials  sourcing  and  packaging  (see  section  4.1.1 for details);\n\n- 2. Kering  provides  central  management  through  a  team  of 27  people  (one  Director,  one  Manager,  13  auditors specialized in conducting supplier audits and monitoring anomalies,  nine  people  dedicated  to  management,  and three planners); depending on needs (locations, workload, etc.),  this  team  can  be  assisted  by  an  external  service provider;\n- 3. clear and  uniform  procedures  for  all  the  Houses, corresponding  to  the  different  stages  of  the  supplier relationship, including the activation procedure, monitoring procedure, and termination of contract procedure;\n- 4. audit plans are regularly updated to take into account new suppliers  and  exclude  those  that  have  become  inactive Risk assessments and audit plans are constructed on the basis  of  a  set  of  predefined  criteria.  Audit  plans  are regularly updated to take into account new suppliers and exclude those that have become inactive;",

        "page_content": "- 5. A single and comprehensive audit methodology, including not  only  the  key  chapters  relating  to  social  compliance, but also the essential components relating to health and safety, and environmental management.  Containing 97  questions,  the  comprehensive  audit  questionnaire  is divided into 13 categories (child labor, forced labor, health and  safety,  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to collective  bargaining,  discrimination,  the  environment, etc.)  and  aligned  with  the  best  standards  in  the  field,  in particular the SA8000 and SMETA standards. The findings are  consolidated  between  the  Houses  in  order  to  avoid any overlap in the audits. Follow-up audits with a smaller scope  focus  on  the  area(s)  in  which  breaches  of compliance  were  identified  or  observations  were  made during  the  first  comprehensive  audit.  In  any  case,  the announced or unannounced audits consist  of  document reviews,  site  tours,  and  worker  interviews.  Workers  are selected  to  offer  a  representation  of  the  workforce, notably concerning age and union affiliation, if any. These interviews  are  confidential.  The  frequency  of  audits depends on the results of previous audits, meaning that better  rated  suppliers  will  tend  to  be  audited  less frequently. Nevertheless, periodic audits will be undertaken regularly to ensure compliance;\n- 6. Anomalies  classified  into  four  categories  and  standard responses to each case:\n- a) zero tolerance breaches (relating to the most serious situations  liable  to  be  encountered,  specifically child  labor,  forced  labor,  irregular  work,  undeclared subcontractors, threats, discrimination, serious breaches of regulations, counterfeiting, etc.).\n- b) serious compliance breaches:\n- The supplier is given one month to resolve the serious compliance breach, and a follow-up audit is scheduled to confirm that the issue has been resolved.\n\nIdentification  of  a  zero  tolerance  breach  or  serious compliance breach triggers the immediate establishment of  a  committee  bringing  together  the  Kering  audit team and the relevant House(s) to decide on the future of  the  relationship  with  the  supplier:  immediate shutdown of the approval process if the supplier is in the  process  of  being  activated  but  has  not  started working;  and  discussions  about  the  possibility  of remediation and support for the supplier or about the need  to  terminate  the  contractual  relationship  if  the supplier is working on one or more orders. The House is the ultimate decision-maker on the most appropriate response.\n\n- c) moderate compliance breach:\n\nThe  supplier  is  given  three  months  to  resolve  the moderate compliance breach, and a follow-up audit is scheduled to confirm that the issue has been resolved.\n\n- d) observations:\n\nThese give rise to a corrective action plan, and are the subject of a dedicated checklist at the next audit. The supplier has six months to remedy the observation.\n\nFor  each  of  the  13  categories  of  the  comprehensive audit  questionnaire,  a  detailed  description  of  what constitutes zero tolerance breaches, serious or moderate compliance breaches and observations has been prepared. For example, in the health and safety category, any situation liable to endanger the lives of workers  is  a  zero  tolerance  breach;  the  absence  of mandatory  documentation  on  aspects  liable  to endanger  the  health  or  safety  of  employees  is  a serious compliance breach; the absence of mandatory documentation other than that addressing the health or safety of workers is a moderate compliance breach; and a deviation from existing procedures results in an observation. In the social category, the falsification of the  certificate  proving  payment  of  social  security contributions  is  a  zero  tolerance  breach;  any  issue relating to the minimum wage is a serious compliance breach; a failure to comply with updates to collective bargaining  agreements  is  a  moderate  compliance breach;  and  a  failure  to  implement  laws  to  promote the  professional  integration  of  vulnerable  people results in an observation.\n\nDepending on the results of audits, suppliers are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 compliant  (no  zero  tolerance  breaches,  no  compliance breaches,  whether  serious  or  moderate,  fewer  than  five observations);\n- \u00b7 partially compliant (no zero tolerance breaches, no serious compliance breaches, fewer than five moderate breaches);\n- \u00b7 progress expected (no zero tolerance breaches, more than five moderate compliance breaches or at least one serious breach);\n- \u00b7 zero tolerance (at least one zero tolerance breach).\n\nThis  organization,  effective  since  January  1,  2016,  is  being phased into both Kering's Houses and their suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Strategic suppliers are those needed to ensure business continuity due to  the  volume  of  production  involved  and/or  their  specific know-how. In addition, 5.5% of suppliers are deemed \"at risk\" because they are located in countries considered by the Group to  be  \"at  risk\".  A  country  is  deemed  to  be  'at  risk'  when  the indicators contained in various external databases imply that human rights risks are high or very high.\n\n15.3% of suppliers were deemed critical in 2021. Suppliers are deemed critical when they are strategic and/or at risk. If they meet both criteria, they are only counted once. They are given special attention in view of their importance to the business and their location.\n\nSubcontracting without prior authorization is not permitted.\n\nAmong  its  suppliers,  Kering  also  singles  out  raw  material suppliers.  Raw  materials  suppliers  identified  as  key  to  the Group represent roughly 20% of all such suppliers, corresponding to approximately 80% of purchases.\n\nLastly,  for  a  limited  portion  of  its  activities  (fragrances  and cosmetics),  Kering  also  works  with  licensed  suppliers,  i.e. those that are under license to the Houses.\n\nWithin this portfolio of suppliers, 3,420 audits were conducted in 2021 despite the health crisis (compared with 3,441 in 2019 and  2,399  in  2020),  breaking  down  as  1,727  comprehensive audits  and  1,693  follow-up  audits.  A  total  of  39%  of  these audits  were  carried  out  by  Kering's  Internal  Audit  team,  and 61%  by  external  auditors,  with  the  Group  audit  protocol applied in the same way for all audits conducted. This means that 64% of suppliers were audited in 2021. 90% of suppliers were  audited  in  2015-2021.  Some  of  these  audits  concern suppliers that have become inactive: 275 of the audits carried out in 2021 covered suppliers that were inactive at the end of the year, and 53% of the suppliers in the system that are now inactive have been audited since 2015.\n\nMoreover,  Kering  has  undertaken  to  audit  all  of  its  key suppliers every two years. It should be noted that 'activation' audits  for  new  suppliers  are  comprehensive  audits,  and  that they  therefore  cover  the  entire  scope  of  a  comprehensive audit.\n\nIn  addition  to  auditing  activities,  the  team  is  involved  in support activities  on  special  projects  in  partnership  with  the Houses  and  other  Kering  departments.  The  COVID-19 pandemic has affected audit planning all over the world and made it more complicated on a variety of levels depending on the country.",

A  total  of  28  suppliers  saw  their business relationship terminated in 2021 due to unsatisfactory audit results.\n\nRobust corrective action plans were put together following the audits,  wherever  breaches  of  compliance,  and  particularly serious breaches, were identified. Follow-up audits were then conducted  to  verify  the  resolution  of  the  problem.  The zero-tolerance  breaches  identified  during  the  audits  were dealt with immediately, in accordance with established rules and in coordination with the relevant Houses. To speed up the resolution  of  issues,  the  central  team  held  more  than 341 committee meetings with the Houses.\n\nFor  example,  one  case  identified  in  2021  concerned  a situation  in  which  employment  contracts  contained  clauses relating to maternity/paternity and childcare leave that did not comply  with  local  legislation.  This  resulted  in  a  corrective action plan being drawn up within the framework of which the clauses were revised.\n\n## 4.1.3.4 Beyond social audits\n\nNo matter how robust and efficient, a social auditing system is never  sufficient  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  risks  in  the complex supply chains of a global Group, whose links - and especially the most distant ones - are shared with other luxury groups,  or  even  other  industries,  such  as  the  textile  industry or even the food industry for leather, a key raw material for the Kering  group.  To  this  end,  Kering,  as  a  major  player  in  the luxury goods industry and aware of its social responsibility in respect of a wide range of suppliers, subcontractors and raw material  production  chains,  engages  in  continuous  and collaborative  dialogue  on  human  rights  with  the  various players in its supply chains through:\n\n- \u00b7 sector-based  initiatives  such  as  membership  of  the Sustainable  Apparel  Coalition  and  Textile  Exchange  (see section 5.1);\n- \u00b7 training programs, capacity building programs and initiatives  specifically  designed  by  Kering  for  its  suppliers and subcontractors (see section 4.1.2);\n- \u00b7 House-led  initiatives  on  specific  challenges,  such  as  the project developed by Gucci for the integration of refugees in Italy with the Adecco Foundation and the UNHCR.\n\nThis  dialogue  and  its  social  impact  on  the  Group's  activities and  beyond  its  operations  are  described  in  section  2.5.  It  is part  of  Kering's  global  approach  to  stakeholder  dialogue  on sustainability issues, as presented in section 5.1.\n\nBreakdown by severity of anomalies recorded during social audits carried out by the Kering group among critical T1 suppliers as of December 31, 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

The rollout of  the  Kering  Standards  across  all  of  its  activities  helps  to reduce  the  Group's  carbon  footprint  outside  its  operations through the adoption of raw material sourcing practices with a reduced carbon footprint, building, for instance, on requirements  in  respect  of  animal  rearing  methods.  The actions  undertaken  by  the  Group  to  specifically  target  its footprint  in  its  supply  chains,  outside  its  own  activities,  are described below.\n\n## Commitment and initiatives\n\nKering contributes to the practical implementation of projects aiming to reduce the environmental footprint of its suppliers, as shown by the Clean By Design program. Spearheaded in 2013\n\nby  the  NRDC  (Natural  Resources  Defense  Council),  the  Clean by Design program aims to reduce the environmental footprint of textile manufacturers through the organization of energy-water audits reviewing ten key points of the performance of a production site.\n\nClean  by  Design  has  been  implemented  at  the  premises  of 37 Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers located in Italy (dyeing, printing and  finishing  factories,  spinning  and  weaving  mills,  denim laundries),  and  has  also  been  extended  to  other  activities further up supply chains through three wool cleaning factories and  three  silk  mills.  The  factories  involved  in  the  program received  an  assessment  of  their  energy  efficiency,  and  water and  chemicals  use  from  Kering,  and  subsequently  agreed  to put in place certain measures to improve their performance. The average energy savings obtained are 19% per site, mainly in  the  range of 10% to 20%, with highs of 40%. The program has  compelling  economic  appeal,  since  the  return  on investment  of  efficiency  initiatives  for  suppliers  is  less  than 2.5 years in Italy and less than one year in China.\n\n## Focus on: the extension of Clean by Design in Italy\n\nIn  February  2021,  Kering  announced  the  extension  of  Clean  by  Design  in  Italy  with  the  Apparel  Impact  Institute  (Aii),  in partnership with Stella McCartney and Burberry. Aii has taken lead of the program and is developing it on a larger scale. The local partner managing the program in Italy is Legambiente, the country's largest environmental NGO. With this new multibrand and multi-stakeholder organization, Kering aims to develop the program on a much larger scale involving many more suppliers  and  other  brands  in  order  to  steer  developments  in  the  textile  supply  chain  towards  increasingly  ambitious sustainability objectives. Eight of Brioni's suppliers and three of its production plants joined the program in 2021.\n\nKering's logistics hub  runs  trainings  and  awareness-raising meetings  with  suppliers  and  in  particular  with  its  logistics partners  on  (i)  Kering's  Climate  Strategy,  with  most  freight operators  now  providing  the  Group  with  CO2  reports  in accordance  with  the  EN  16258  standard;  (ii)  expectations  in terms of environmental performance in line with the Group's ambitions  (reporting,  circularity,  single-use  plastics,  carbon footprint). ISO 14001  certification  is  also  one  of  the contractual requirements of BtoB transportation providers.\n\nSome Houses such as Gucci have also made a commitment to their  suppliers to implement energy efficiency measures and use  green  energy.  Use  of  energy  from  renewable  sources amounted to 25% in Gucci's supply chain,  and  up  to  50%  in certain categories (leather and shoes production process).",

For instance, waste  treatment  methods  (landfill,  incineration,  etc.)  can result in the discharge of landfill leachate into the soil, while water  pollution  can  disrupt  aquatic  ecosystems  through\n\neutrophication.

The  biggest  risks  have  been identified  on  leather  (including  tanning  and  finishing)  and textiles (especially dyeing). The watches and jewelry industries have been rated as least at risk among the Group's activities.\n\nAs well as complying with fundamental local and international regulations,  Kering  has  set  itself  the  target  of  eliminating  all hazardous  chemicals  from  all  its  Houses'  products  and production processes. To do so, the Group has established two types of lists of substances subject to restrictions:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Manufacturing  Restricted  Substance  List  (MRSL)  for production processes;\n- \u00b7 the Product Restricted Substance List (PRSL) for products.\n\n## Commitment and sector initiatives\n\n## Focus on: Kering's commitments and objectives concerning chemicals management\n\n- \u00b7 Contractual  requirements  for  all  suppliers  include  the  implementation  of  a  chemicals  management  system  within businesses and the rollout of these requirements among their suppliers during the early stages.\n- \u00b7 Kering has set itself the target of eliminating all hazardous chemicals from all its Houses' production.\n- \u00b7 By 2025:\n- - 100% of eligible suppliers evaluated in the Vendor Portal on chemicals management and compliance with the MRSL;\n- - 100% of strategic suppliers covered by the MRSL compliance control process, which comprises audit or certification;\n- - Testing of wastewater for all strategic suppliers.\n\nKering has been a signatory member of ZDHC (Zero Discharge of Hazardous  Chemicals  Group)  since  2016.  The  ZDHC Programme  is  supported  by  roughly  30  major  international brands and upwards of 100 industrial partners committed to encouraging sector-wide take-up of best practices and the use of sustainable chemicals with a view to eradicating the most hazardous  substances  from  textiles,  leather  and  footwear industry supply chains. Kering plays an active role in the work of  the  ZDHC  Programme  and,  in  2021,  continued  to  help  it expand  its  activity  in  Italy  by  promoting  contact  with  key players and suppliers.\n\nIn 2021, Kering continued to participate in the ZDHC Brands to Zero Programme, for which purpose the Group's actions taken to eliminate  dangerous  chemicals  from  its  production processes were evaluated by a third party. The primary goal of this initiative is to assess signatory brands' alignment with the ZDHC  Programme  and  to  promote  the  harmonization  of industry efforts by defining a personalized roadmap for each brand. 2021 was also the year of the official launch of the new ZDHC  Suppliers  to  Zero  Programme  in  Europe.  Kering's operations  teams  were  closely  involved  in  defining  this program  and  the  evaluation  criteria,  as  well  as  its  rollout across its supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  means  that  no  substance  listed  in  Kering's MRSL  can  be  intentionally  used  in  the  manufacturing processes of the Houses' supply chains. Version 2.0 of Kering's MRSL,  released  in  2020  and  became  effective  in  April  2021, corresponds  to  the  Zero  Discharge  of  Hazardous  Chemicals (ZDHC)  MRSL  V2.0  rounded  out  by  a  ban  on  certain perfluorochemicals  (PFCs).  Contractual  requirements  for  all suppliers  also  include  the  implementation  of  a  chemicals management  system  within  businesses  and  the  rollout  of these requirements among suppliers upstream.\n\n## 2) Supplier evaluation\n\nKering has developed  a  'chemicals  management/MRSL compliance' indicator in the Vendor Portal. To do this, Kering evaluated  more  than  1,200  suppliers  (representing  95%  of purchasing)  in  different  product  categories  by  means  of detailed annual self-assessment questionnaires combining all data to be aligned with Kering's contractual requirements, in addition  to  detailed  evaluations  or  audits  of  strategic suppliers.  75%  (by  value)  of  suppliers  evaluated  obtained  a good or excellent score. Kering's aim is for all eligible suppliers to  be  evaluated  using  this  indicator  by  2025.  The  results  are reviewed biannually with the Houses' operations departments. These  committee  meetings  provide  the  opportunity  to discuss suppliers' level of compliance and define measures to be taken for the suppliers concerned, such as help to improve their performance, implementation of corrective measures or even breaking off business relations with suppliers that fail to comply. In addition, on-site audits are conducted on strategic suppliers to check whether they meet requirements relating to chemicals management. In 2021, 79 audits were carried out, relating  to  67%  of  purchasing  of  raw  materials  (leather  and fabrics)  and  73%  of  purchasing  of  finished  products  for Kering's ready-to-wear  and  accessories  products  either covered  by  a  Kering  audit  or  certified  by  a  third  party  with regard  to  chemicals  management.  In  terms  of  chemicals management, Kering has set itself the target that the process for checking compliance with the MRSL - comprising audit or certification - covers all strategic suppliers by 2025.\n\nKering acknowledges that with the current level of technology and  knowledge,  despite  good  chemicals  management  at  the outset,  some  contamination  by  hazardous  chemicals  in production  processes  could  still  be  possible  and  affect  the quality  of  water  discharged  by  facilities.  In  order  to  promote ongoing  improvement  in  chemicals  management,  Kering intends to step up its checks of compliance with the MRSL by also performing tests on wastewater for all strategic suppliers by  2025.  This  approach  is  recommended  by  ZDHC  and  will\n\nmake it possible to identify compliance failings and potential contamination by analyzing the root causes and improving the quality and safety of effluents.\n\n## 3) Ongoing training\n\nKering  has  continued  to  step  up  its  capacity  internally  and with  its  suppliers  with  regard  to  these  issues  by  means  of various training sessions on MRSL management. In 2021, two training  sessions  were  organized  for  leather,  textiles  and finished  products  suppliers,  and  three  training  sessions  for 30 employees  of  Kering  and  its  Houses  (purchasing, sustainability, R&D and product development). These sessions were  held  with  the  support  of  a  ZDHC  training  provider  to ensure a consistent approach.\n\nIn  2018,  Bottega  Veneta  was  the  first  House  to  roll  out  the MRSL  to  a  group  of  leather  goods  and  shoe  manufacturers. Between 2018 and 2021, the brand continued its work to bring an  ever-greater  proportion  of  leather  goods  and  shoe production  workshops  in  line  with  its  MRSL  approach. Since 2019, a total of 12 new suppliers have received training in the MRSL and its tools, either at the House's headquarters or by videoconference. To date, more than 95% of the leather used  in  leather  goods  and  shoes  comes  from  tanneries involved  in  the  brand's  Chemical  Management  Voluntary Project.\n\nGucci, as Chair of the Sustainability Committee of the Camera Nazionale  Della  Moda (CNMI),  was  particularly  active  in  the debate on the negative impact of dangerous chemicals in the luxury  industry,  and  contributed  to  the  preparation  and circulation of Industry Guidelines on eco-toxicological requirements  for  apparel,  leather  goods,  footwear  and accessories. The House has completed the implementation of the  MRSL with major raw material, shoes, leather goods and ready-to-wear suppliers.\n\nThere have also been a number of initiatives at the level of the Houses to ensure the quality of their products and the safety of  their  consumers  in  line  with  regulatory  requirements  (see section 5.2.4).\n\n## 4.1.4.3 Water management\n\n## Main impacts and 2021 EP&L results\n\nWater  security  is  a  major  global  challenge  in  view  of unanimous  scientific  findings  underscoring  the  urgency  and criticality of climate change and biodiversity loss. The analysis carried  out  as  part  of  the  Group's  EP&L  methodology  shows that water use and pollution can have a wide range of impacts, and  can  give  rise  to  significant  risks  in  respect  of  the availability and quality of water in various parts of the world. For instance, water pollution can disrupt aquatic ecosystems through  eutrophication,  and  mismanagement  of  water  use can create life-threatening competition for local communities (competition  between  the  production  of  raw  materials  and food,  for  example).  This  can  have  adverse  human  health impacts, and can also result in reduced agricultural yields and other serious disruptions of ecosystem services.",

These  programs  are described for  each  material  in  section  4.2.2  (Leather,  Metals, Fibers, etc.).\n\nKering's water management strategy is detailed in the Group's public response to the 2021 CDP Water Security Questionnaire (Kering obtained a score of A and is included in the Water A list),  which  can  be  accessed  on  www.cdp.net.  It  sets  out  the Group's  governance  with  respect  to  water  management,  risk management and the Group's objectives and performance.\n\n## 4.2 Preserving natural capital across our entire supply chain (up to Tier 4)\n\n## 4.2.1 Responsible land use and protection of biodiversity\n\nFirmly believing that businesses have a decisive role to play in the face of scientists' observation of biodiversity loss, and that there  is  a  link  between  the  preservation  of  ecosystems  and the  sustainability  of  its  economic  activity,  Kering  has  made protecting biodiversity a key aspect of its strategy. As a player in  the  luxury  sector,  the  nature  of  its  products  and  the\n\ncorresponding  quality  requirements  make  the  Group  largely dependent on natural raw materials (wool, cashmere, leather, cotton, silk, etc.) and their ecosystems. These biodiversity-rich natural  habitats  provide  essential  services  to  our  societies, such  as  climate  regulation,  soil  regeneration,  water  filtration and the availability of raw materials for our activities, but also for food, medicine and construction.\n\nThis is the spirit of the Group's biodiversity strategy published in 2020 (see section 3.2.1.1).\n\n## 4.2.1.1 Measurement of ecosystem services and biodiversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group's  2021  EP&L  results  show  that  31%  of  Kering's environmental impacts relate to biodiversity and land use, and that they are mostly in Tier 4 (production of raw materials) of its supply chains.\n\nKering  is  committed  to  improving  the  allowance  made  for biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services  in  its  EP&L  and  to improving the data and knowledge underlying these evaluations. Work in 2021 focused on the continuation of the partnership  with  Stanford  University's  Natural  Capital  Project and  NASA  to  explore  opportunities  for  using  remote  sensor\n\ndata  to  track  changes  and  progress  in  ecosystem  services generated  by  the  implementation  of  sustainable  pastoral practices by nomadic cashmere breeders in the Gobi region of Mongolia.  This  partnership  is  part  of  a  five-year  program aimed at demonstrating that remote sensor data can be used in  real  time  to  support  the  development  of  low-impact  and biodiversity-friendly farming methods. For Kering, this work is of particular importance, as it enables the Group to contribute directly  to  scientific  progress  in  natural  climate  solutions  for agriculture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  2021,  Kering  selected  seven  projects  that  will  be supported as part of its new Regenerative Fund for Nature (see below),  located  in  priority  regions  identified  in  collaboration with Conservation International. Key data from Kering's supply chain  has  been  superimposed  onto  geographic  information system analysis to identify the Earth's 'biodiversity hotspots' specifically identifying locations that are critical for biodiversity, as well as for carbon sequestration.\n\nThe Group has been supporting nature conservation, restoration  and  regeneration  programs  in  some  of  these 'biodiversity hotspots' for several years. Examples include the program for the complete reforestation of mining sites in the Amazonian  forest  run  in  partnership  with  Solicaz  and ReforestFinance,  the  program  for  soil  regeneration  and species  protection  in  the  Gobi  Desert  in  partnership  with Wildlife Conservation International, and support for the Karoo Lamb  Consortium's  efforts  to  preserve  the  rich  heritage  of biodiversity in the Karoo region of South Africa.\n\n## 4.2.1.3 Implementation of biodiversity targets\n\nThe  objectives  set  by  the  new  Biodiversity  Strategy  are  clear and measurable, insofar as they are related to the Group's core business.  In  line  with  this,  Kering  joined  the  new  corporate engagement  program  of  the  Science  Based  Targets  Network (SBTN) in 2020 and has played an active role in developing a shared strategy for all stakeholders and the implementation of actions between now and 2022. The program will provide the SBTN  with  strategic  insights  into  cutting-edge  science  and approaches,  as  well  as  providing  an  open  forum  for  sharing best practices and  experience  with  other  groups  and coalitions. In turn, this will allow Kering to continue to refine its objectives based on the best available scientific data.\n\n## 4.2.1.4 Implementation of actions guided by the conservation hierarchy\n\nIn accordance with the SBTN hierarchy, Kering has structured its  existing and future work on protecting biodiversity on the basis of the concept of Avoid, Reduce, Restore & Regenerate, Transform.\n\n## 1. Avoid\n\nAs a priority, the Houses avoid sourcing materials with known material negative impacts on the environment, particularly in areas  of  critical  ecological  importance.  As  specified  in  the Kering Standards, this includes ensuring that supplies are all sourced  from  materials  that  do  not  cause  deforestation,  as well  as  ensuring  that  materials  adhere  closely  to  the guidelines as published within the framework of CITES.\n\n## 2. Reduce\n\nAs a second priority, when impacts are inevitable, Kering and its Houses  strive  to  reduce  negative  impacts  on  the environment by sourcing materials from preferred sources as defined  in  the  Kering  Standards,  which  list  recommended third-party  certifications  in  the  Group's  supply  chains  that guarantee  low-impact  agricultural  practices,  such  as  organic farming  for  instance.  In  2021,  71%  of  raw  materials  were aligned with the Kering Standards. The goal is to reach 100% by 2025.\n\n## 3. Restore & Regenerate\n\nIn addition to avoiding negative impacts, Kering aims to bring about  a  paradigm  shift  by  restoring  and  regenerating ecosystems.\n\nFollowing  the  launch  in  2020  of  the  Regenerative  Fund  for Nature, which aims to convert one million hectares of farms and  rangelands  producing  materials  for  its  supply  chain  to regenerative agricultural practices by 2025, a rigorous process for identifying and selecting projects was carried out in 2021. Kering  and  its  partner  Conservation  International  selected seven  projects  out  of  more  than  75  put  forward  around  the world  relating  to  cotton,  leather,  wool  and  cashmere  supply chains.  These  projects  represent  a  total  of  840,000  hectares that will eventually be converted into regenerative agricultural space and involve 60,000 people across the globe.\n\nKering is also still a founder member of the Savory Institute's Frontier Founder initiative, which aims to encourage regenerative grazing practices around the world by promoting the  identification  of  farms  that  produce  such  key  raw materials as wool, shearling and leather. In addition, thanks to the  Savory  Institute's  Ecological  Outcome  Verification  (EOV) program,  Kering  has  access  to  data  and  verifications  carried out by the Institute to demonstrate the positive impact of its sourcing choices on soil, water management, animal welfare and  biodiversity.  In  2021,  the  collaboration  with  the  Savory Institute  focused  on  establishing  and  supporting  wool  and leather supply chains around the world (New Zealand, United Kingdom, Spain, etc.).",

        "page_content": "## 4. Transform\n\nIn support of the net positive impact goal, Kering continued to back initiatives outside the Group's direct supply chains.\n\n## 1) Linking carbon footprint and biodiversity\n\n- \u00b7 As  part  of  its  biodiversity  strategy,  Kering  will  protect  an additional one million hectares of essential and irreplaceable  habitats  outside  of  its  supply  chain,  through programs that will be beneficial on multiple levels, in terms of biodiversity protection, carbon  sequestration  and improved livelihoods for local people.\n- \u00b7 Carbon  credits  have  been  obtained  to  offset  all  its  direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3) through support for several REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and  Forest  Degradation)  programs,  with  VCS  (Verified Carbon  Standard)  verification.  All  projects  supported  by Kering  are  certified  by  the  Climate,  Community  and Biodiversity  Alliance  (CCBA),  which  recognizes  the  positive contribution  of  REDD+  projects  for  the  conservation  of biodiversity  and  ecosystems,  but  also  for  the  living conditions  of  local  populations.  Kering  makes  multi-year commitments  so  that  project  leaders  have  sufficient visibility  to  develop  their  business  models.  The  Group  is also  working  on  shifting  its  carbon  credits  towards  more innovative projects that are integrated into its supply chain. Since  2020,  Kering  has  invested  in  Low  Carbon  Label projects,  in  partnership  with  IDELE (Institut  de  l'\u00c9levage) , which  support  French  cattle  breeders  in  developing  more carbon-efficient practices.\n\n## 2) Biodiversity awareness\n\n- \u00b7 Kering joined forces with the University of Cambridge and NGO  Biodiversify  in  2020  to  publish  a  primer  to  raise awareness  of  this  issue  among  companies  in  the  fashion sector:  'Developing  a  Corporate  Biodiversity  Strategy:  A Primer  for  the  Fashion  Industry'.  Intended  as  a  guide  for other  companies  on  how  to  build  a  biodiversity  strategy and  transform  their  relationship  with  nature,  the  primer sets out eight practical steps to assess a company's impact on nature, guide decisions about how a company interacts with nature and develop strategic responses to climate and biodiversity challenges.\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  Kering  was  involved  in  co-financing  a  Textile Exchange  study  to  assess  programs,  standards  and certifications relating to regenerative  agriculture.  The purpose  of  this  study  was  to  make  the  concept  of regenerative agriculture more accessible and operational in order  to  step  up  the  pace  of  adoption  within  the  fashion industry.  The  initial  findings  were  presented  at  Textile Exchange's  2021  conference.  The  final  report  will  be published in the first quarter of 2022.\n- \u00b7 Kering  has  contributed  to  a  variety  of  conferences, including  the  World  Conservation  Congress,  the  China International Import Expo, the European Business & Nature Summit and many others. Kering representatives also spoke at  events  organized  by  the  Savory  Institute,  Fashion  for Good  and Institut  Fran\u00e7ais  de  la  Mode .  These  conferences offer the opportunity to share expertise on how the private sector  can  act  on  biodiversity  challenges  by  adopting responsible  and  sustainable  supply  chain  management practices, and how to communicate on the contributions of Kering's  EP&L  measurement  methodology  in  targeting priorities for action on the various links in the supply chain and on matters relating to raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Kering  continues  to  invest  in  the  act4nature  movement created by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE), which the Group  joined  when  it  was  launched  in  2018.  Renamed 'act4nature  international'  in  2020,  the  coalition  involves international groups  based  in  France  in  protecting, enhancing  and  restoring  biodiversity  by  signing  shared commitments and setting individual targets to incorporate protecting biodiversity into the heart of what they do.\n- \u00b7 Kering  is  also  a  member  company  of  the  One  Planet  for Biodiversity Business (OP2B) coalition, launched in 2019 on the sidelines of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. OP2B brings together 19 companies, largely from the agrifood  sector,  along  with  a  smaller  contingent  from  the cosmetics sector and the world of fashion, of which Kering is the sole representative. Its aim is to protect and restore biodiversity within the supply chains of member companies and  their  product  portfolios,  with  actions  focused  around three pillars: scaling up regenerative agricultural practices, reintroducing  cultivated  biodiversity  in  supply  chains,  and protecting  high-value  natural  ecosystems,  notably  by eliminating deforestation. Kering continued to play a major role  within  OP2B in 2021, particularly on topics related to regenerative agriculture.\n- \u00b7 In addition, since 2019, Kering has had a partnership with the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). This is the first partnership that IPBES has ever established with a private sector player. This global body of experts, founded with the support of the UN in 2012, is tasked with assessing the state of biodiversity around the world and raising awareness on this issue. The support  provided  by  Kering  contributes  to  the  work conducted by the IPBES to supplement scientific data and, as  such,  to  foster  more  informed  decisions  concerning nature.  Among  other  things,  this  involves  establishing political support and capacity-building activities, developing new  knowledge,  carrying  out  awareness-raising  initiatives and providing assessments performed by scientific experts.\n- \u00b7 Finally,  Kering  is  an  active  member  of  the  Fashion  Pact working  group  on  biodiversity,  of  which  it  is  a  founding member.\n\nAs  detailed  in  the  next  section,  the  Houses  are  involved  in promoting  the  development  of  regenerative  agriculture  and animal  rearing  practices  within  their  supply  chains  (see section 4.2.2), as well as in conservation initiatives under their brand  (see  section  5.4).  In  addition,  the  Group's  watch  and jewelry  Houses,  by  sourcing  gold  through  the  Kering  Ethical Gold  Platform,  are  also  acting  in  favor  of  conservation  by supporting  gold  production  that  does  not  pollute  natural environments  with  mercury  and  cyanide.  In  2021,  Kering continued its reforestation program in French Guiana.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  Kering,  critical impacts  are  generated  by  the  raw  materials  used  in  large quantities  and  whose  production  can  have  a  significant impact  on  the  environment,  such  as  leather,  or  by  raw materials  used  in  small  quantities  but  whose  extraction  or production  can  have  a  heavy  impact.  This  is  the  case  for animal fibers  such  as  wool  and  cashmere,  as  well  as  metals (such as gold and brass).\n\nThe Group's environmental footprint directly mirrors its use of raw materials. For instance, leather products and textile fibers of  animal  origin  have  a  strong  impact  on  greenhouse  gas emissions and land conversion. The use of metals, especially precious  metals,  has  a  significant  impact  on  water  pollution because  of  the  chemicals  used  in  extraction  and  the  early stages  of  the  refining  process.  Impact  analysis  by  material enables  Kering  to  prioritize  and  focus  efforts  on  the  raw materials and supply chains that generate the greatest impact, even when the volumes of these materials are low.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n50\n\nKering has committed to reducing its environmental footprint in the pre-operations phases, starting with the production of its  raw  materials.  To  this  end,  the  Smart  Sourcing  program, launched  in  2013,  provides  recommendations  and  guidance for the Houses, allowing them to use raw materials produced sustainably and responsibly. This project draws on the Kering Standards  and  relies  on  close  collaboration  between  the Group  and  its  Houses,  bringing  together  the  Materials\n\nInnovation  Lab,  supply  chain,  R&D  and  Sustainability  teams, with the aim of adapting new responsible sourcing solutions to the specific needs of each House.\n\nIn  2021,  Kering  traced  90%  of  its  key  materials  back  to  the country of origin at least,  and  even  further  for  animal-based materials  (leather,  precious  skins).  The  Kering  Standards  aim to increase this level of traceability by 2025, going as far back as the farm for all animal products.",

Cattle  and  sheep  farming  and  leather  processing operations  (including  tanning)  together  represent  one  of  the most  significant  environmental  impacts  across  the  Group's supply chains (35% of the total impact in 2021).\n\nThe  concept  of  responsible  leather,  as  defined  in  the  Kering Standards,  combines  traceability,  i.e.,  leather  that  can  be traced  back  to  all  stages  from  slaughterhouse  and  farm, sourcing  from  farms  that  minimize  their  environmental impact and respect animal welfare, tanning using chrome-free processes  and  soil  regeneration.  In  terms  of  traceability, in  2021  Kering  expanded  its  work  on  the  investigation  and traceability  of  hides,  most  of  which  come  from  Europe,  by adding  to  the  in-depth  map  of  its  supply  chain,  making  it possible to identify 389 slaughterhouses in some 40 countries worldwide.  Purchases  in  2021  showed  that  93%  of  skins  are traceable back to the slaughterhouse (93% for cattle skins, and 95% for sheep skins), and several Houses have already begun to go further back in their supply chains. Kering's aim is for all skins to be traceable back to the farm by 2025. Kering and its Houses  are  testing  and  developing  several  technologies  to trace leather at each stage of production, in particular to avoid losing track at the slaughterhouse, which is the most sensitive link in the chain.\n\nIn terms of animal welfare, Kering published its Standards for all  animal  species  present  in  its  supply  chains  in  2019,  also releasing standards specifically targeting calves, cattle,  sheep and goats, which account for a particularly sizable proportion of  the  leather  supply  chain.  The  Standards  were  published alongside  specific  practical  guidelines  for  slaughterhouses (see  section  4.2.3).  In  2021,  when  updating  its  Standards, Kering  updated  its  map  of  food  labels  that  meet  a  level equivalent  to  its  Standards  in  terms  of  animal  welfare  and\n\nenvironmental  protection,  both  at  the  farm  and  in  the slaughterhouse.  The  chosen  approach  draws  on  existing standards in the food industry and creates links between the leather  and  meat  supply  chains.  To  date,  25  standards corresponding  to  the  requirements  set  out  in  the  Kering Standards  have  been  identified  in  close  to  40  countries around the world.\n\nIn  2021,  a  dozen  physical  audits  were  performed  to  check compliance  with  the  Kering  Standards  at  slaughterhouses, notably in Italy, Serbia and Turkey.\n\nAn  internal  working  group  dedicated  to  responsible  leather brings  together  representatives  from  all  the  Group's  leatherusing Houses to join forces and make progress in this area. In 2021, work focused on transparency and traceability, as well as regenerative agriculture and how to facilitate its adoption within leather supply chains. A dedicated Idea Lab on leather, involving most of Kering's Houses, has met regularly over the last five years.\n\nThe Houses are also involved, as demonstrated by Balenciaga, which has launched the Spin 360 traceability project with its Italian  tanneries  in  order  to  improve  information  collected about  their  supplies  (countries,  slaughterhouses,  breeding regions) and their practices, in particular use of certification or independent third party evaluations.\n\nKering  also  continued  its  collaborations  with  players  in  the food industry - and especially the meat industry - in 2021. As supply chains are shared, this will make for faster verification procedures and, where necessary, improved practices. Kering is jointly steering a working group on animal welfare alongside the  National  Leather  Council,  as  part  of  the  collective  Paris Good Fashion  initiative.  A  study  has  been  launched  into  the link  between  the  quality  of  skins  and  animal  welfare,  which will be made public in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAs  well  as  working  on  its  own  supply  chains,  Kering  aims  to encourage and promote the emergence of more responsible practices in the industry, particularly through the development of  certification  for  leather.  Kering  is  a  member  of  Textile Exchange, and sits on its Board of Directors. This organization is  committed  to  promoting  the  production  and  use  of  more sustainable textiles throughout the clothing industry. It is also particularly  active  in  several  working  groups  including  the Responsible Leather Roundtable. Since 2017, Kering has been involved  in  developing  a  benchmark  for  certifications  in leather  supply  chains  and  implementing  a  mechanism  for rewarding  the  most  virtuous  players  in  terms  of  animal welfare  and  respect  for  the  environment.  A  number  of tanneries that work on a regular basis in Italy with the Houses such  as  Balenciaga  are  LWG  or  ICEC (Istituto  di  Certificazione della Qualit\u00e0 per l'Industria Conciaria) certified. In collaboration with  the  ICEC,  Bottega  Veneta  encourages  certification procedures with its key tanneries.\n\n## Metal-free tanning\n\nMetal-free  tanning  techniques  are  also  a  major  focus  of Kering's work on leather. For four years, the Group has worked closely  with  its  tanneries,  as  well  as  its  Houses  and  their suppliers,  to  promote  the  use  of  leather  tanned  without metals.  In  2021,  Kering  advanced  on  the  following  pillars, continuing actions taken in 2020:\n\n- 1. Development of chrome- and metal-free tanning in all of the  Group's  tanneries  by  means  of  R&D  activities  in tanneries,  with  the  aim  of  testing  articles  made  from leather tanned without metals and then putting them into production.\n- 2. Close  collaboration  with  tanneries  to  new  metal-free tanned items, to gradually increase the metal-free quotas in their products. Significant progress has been made, and a  growing  number  of  tanneries  have  started  to  convert their  facilities  to  fully  metal-free  production.  80%  of tanneries that took part in collecting information via the supplier  portal  stated  that  they  provide  products  to  the Group's Houses (leather goods and shoes) that have been tanned without metals or chrome, and 61% have at least LWG or ICEC certification.\n- In  addition, private exhibitions organized by tanneries to present their products to the Houses included metal-free sections.\n- 3. Increase  in  the  proportion  of  metal-free  tanning  in  the collections  of  the  Houses:  in  2021,  42.6%  of  the  Group's leather goods purchases were metal or chrome-free. This percentage was 60.6% for leather goods at Gucci and 32% at Saint Laurent in 2021.\n\nThese efforts on traceability, the optimization of materials and animal  welfare  in  the  leather  industry  have  paid  off  for  the Houses, in keeping with the Group's circularity policy (details of other initiatives are also provided in section 5.2.1):\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci traces each batch of leather back to the slaughterhouse and/or farm, and ensures that the country of supply complies with the requirements laid down in the Kering Standards. In 2021, supplier data show that 93% of leather  was  traced  back  to  the  slaughterhouse.  In  2021, Gucci improved its data collection processes and continued to carry out traceability audits at tanneries. The House has\n\ndeveloped  a  best  practice  guide  known  as  the  'Suppliers' Good  Practices Guide for Sustainable Leather' and describing  large-scale  processes  that  can  be  adopted  in tanneries  to  remove  dangerous  heavy  metals  from  the tanning process, to reduce or reuse production and tanning scraps  and  by-products,  to  cut  water  consumption  and pollution, and to reduce energy consumption and emissions.  It  has  also  continued  the  rollout  of  metal-free tanning for its iconic handbag models, customizable small leather items  and  shoes.  In  2016,  Kering  extended metal-free  tanning  to  crocodile  skins,  notably  those  used for watchbands designed by its France Croco tannery.\n\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  Alexander  McQueen  completed  the  pilot  project launched  with  Oritain  and  its  suppliers  and  tanneries  to trace  the  supply  of  leather  used  in  its  leather  goods  and shoes.  This  project  will  continue  in  order  to  enhance database coverage.\n- \u00b7 Bottega  Veneta  has  also  adopted  a  robust  approach  to traceability.  At  the  end  of  2021,  100%  of  Bottega  Veneta's leather was traceable to the country of origin, and 77% of the leather used by the House came from countries aligned with  the  Kering  Standards.  Since  the  Cruise  2014/2015 collection,  the  House  has  been  committed  to  tracing  the leather of some of its Cabat Full Nappa styles, in line with Institute of Quality Certification for the Leather Sector (ICEC) regulation TS-PM414 as part of the certification process for finished  leather  products.  This  certification  has  been renewed  annually  since  2014,  with  coverage  progressively increasing  to  all  Cabat  Nappa  styles.  The  renewal  of  the certification in 2017 covers the new Cabat Nappa Espresso and Nero styles  from  the  Spring/Summer  2018  collection. Bottega Veneta also accompanied the luxury tannery in its TS412 certification process for tanning lambskin from Spain, obtained in September 2018 and renewed in October 2019.\n- \u00b7 Brioni  introduced  into  its  Spring/Summer  2022  and  Fall/ Winter 2022 collections a selection of shoe models made using metal-free leathers.\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent  has  developed  a  set  of  specific  Key Performance  Indicators  (KPIs)  for  its  supplier  evaluation system  in  its  leather  tanneries.  Drawing  on  the  extensive collection  of  data  across  all  product  categories,  levels  of traceability,  percentages  of  Kering  Standards-compliant leather  purchases  and  tannery  EP&L  performances  were calculated  and  monitored  on  a  monthly  basis  since  2019. The  results  feed  into  the  supplier  evaluation  process.  The House uses laser technology to guarantee the traceability of its leather.\n- \u00b7 Several  Houses  have  also  set  up  systems  with  their suppliers for collecting and  recycling scrap leather. Balenciaga's internal cutting center in Scandicci and two of its manufacturers have recycled and recovered several tons of scrap leather as part of a project with partner Ledertech. A  pilot  test  has  also  been  launched  on  the  recycling  of leather scraps with Authentic Materials for reuse as lining, etc.  Since  2013,  Bottega  Veneta  has  installed  a  leather scrap  management  system  at  its  sites,  the  aim  being  to reuse  them  as  fertilizer  while  ensuring  the  processing  of chrome  residues.  In  2021,  over  210  metric  tons  (92%)  of leather scraps were collected and processed thanks to this project,  carried  out  in  cooperation  with  ILSA  and  Waste Recycling, two companies specializing in the collection and treatment of production scraps.",

        "page_content": "Lastly,  the  Group's  strategy  on  the  management  of  leather sourcing  in  relation  to  deforestation  is  made  public  and described  in  Kering's  responses  to  the  CDP  Forests  2021 Questionnaire,  available  at  www.cdp.net.  It  sets  out  the Group's  governance  with  respect  to  cattle,  risk  management, objectives and performance.\n\n## 4.2.2.2 Plant textile fibers\n\nClose  attention  is  paid  to  cotton.  More  specifically,  organic cotton has the major advantage of not being cultivated using pesticides and fertilizers, meaning a greatly reduced environmental footprint (up to 80% reduction compared with conventional cotton). Kering therefore encourages its Houses to step up the use of organic cotton in their collections, in line with the Kering Standards. Kering takes a multi-level approach to responsible cotton:\n\n## 1. Define and maintain high standards of sourcing\n\nThe  standards  laid  down  by  Kering  on  cotton  specify  full traceability  (to  avoid  sourcing  from  high-risk  countries,  as regards  environmental  and  social  impacts)  and  prohibit  the use  of  chemicals  and  pesticides.  To  ensure  that  these standards  are  met,  Kering  encourages  the  use  of  organic cotton, with a preference for Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) or Organic Content Standard (OCS) certifications. Kering is committed to ensuring that 100% of the key materials used by  the  Group  are  consistent  with  the  Kering  Standards by 2025, which means that all cotton used will be of organic origin by this date.\n\n## 2. Help the Houses increase the share of organic cotton in their purchases\n\nIn 2021, the Houses continued with their efforts to use organic cotton,  as  shown  below  by  the  growing  share  of  organic cotton in their collections. This has been made possible by the help  the  experts  at  the  MIL  (see  section  5.2.2),  which  have been working closely with the Houses and Kering's Sustainability  Department,  as  well  as  the  commitment  of strategic suppliers in order to identify and integrate new, more sustainable textiles into the supply chains.\n\n## 3. Collaborate with other players in the sector to promote organic cotton and attract investors\n\nAs co-founder of the Organic Cotton Accelerator (OCA) alongside Textile  Exchange  and  other  brands,  Kering  continued  its support  for  the  development  of  organic  cotton  farming  and the  market  for  organic  cotton.  Companies  joining  the  OCA undertake to comply with a number of guiding principles, such as promoting organic cotton and improving the environmental, social and economic aspects of production.\n\nKering is also a participant in and member of the Organizing Committee  for the Textile Exchange's Organic Cotton Roundtable (OCRT). The OCRT is a global stakeholder platform that supports  and  brings  together  the  organic  cotton community to be inspired, mobilized, and equipped to act. It has  ongoing  working  groups  on  business  models,  seeds  and soils,  and  consumer  engagement,  as  well  as  an  innovation award  that  seeks  out  and  celebrates  new  ideas  in  organic cotton. Each year, the OCRT holds a global in-person meeting. More  recently,  it  has  also  started  holding  two  regional meetings and four virtual meetings annually.\n\nLastly,  Kering  is  an  active  member  of  a  working  group  on regenerative agriculture in connection with cotton growing, as part of the collective Paris Good Fashion initiative. Following the publication of a charter clearly setting out what makes up regenerative agriculture, work is now focused on establishing clear  ties  between  agricultural  practices  and  measurable positive impacts.\n\n## 4. Support projects in the field\n\nThrough  its  partnership  with  the  Organic  Cotton  Accelerator (OCA),  Kering  provides  concrete  support  for  projects  in  the field  in  India  with  the  aim  of  stepping  up  the  pace  of introduction  of  organic  farming  practices  by  helping  farmers making the transition. Furthermore, through the Regenerative Fund  for  Nature,  Kering  also  enables  OCA  to  encourage farmers  already  involved  in  organic  farming  to  adopt additional  measures  to  achieve  quantifiable  regeneration  of the land and biodiversity in general. This project was launched in November 2021 and will continue for three years.\n\n## 5. Innovate for greater traceability of cotton\n\n- \u00b7 The  MIL  has  worked  since  2018  to  obtain  the  first  fully traceable  organic  cotton  fabric  using  forensic  science methods. The project was carried out with two long-standing Kering partners, Italian weaver Albini and Supima, a US-based organization advocating high-quality cotton, as well as with traceability expert Oritain. The technology used fingerprints organic  cotton,  thereby  allowing  it  to  be  tracked  at  all stages  of  production.  It  draws  on  scientific  and  statistical studies that have analyzed the natural chemical properties of  cotton  fiber  to  create  a  unique  chemical  marker identifying the field where the cotton was grown. An exact match with the marker guarantees the authenticity of the organic  cotton,  and  ensures  that  neither  the  raw  material nor  the  fabric  or  finished  product  has  been  substituted, mixed or modified at any stage. In 2021, the MIL continued its work with Oritain for the large-scale rollout of a program to  verify  the  origins  of  cotton  declared  by  suppliers  to Kering  brands.  This  program  allows  the  Houses  to  verify their suppliers' claims and thereby ensure compliance with the rules restricting the origin of cotton in accordance with the Kering Standards. The Houses are thereby continuing to increase  use  of  organic  cotton  in  their  main  product categories,  as  well  as  in  their  packaging.  In  total,  organic cotton  now  accounts  for  51%  of  cotton  used  across  the Group.\n- \u00b7 GOTS-certified  organic  cotton  makes  up  80%  of  the  total volume of cotton purchased by Saint Laurent, as well as by Balenciaga  for  their  production  and  packaging  (flannel bags).  Saint  Laurent  is  collaborating  with  the  MIL  to increase  the  use  of  organic  cotton  in  its  collections, particularly  in  its  denim  and  jersey  product  lines  (shirts, jeans, t-shirts, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Organic  cotton  also  accounts  for  82%  of  cotton  used  by Bottega Veneta for its ready-to-wear collections and for the flannel  bags  protecting  leather  goods,  jewelry  and  shoes. In  2021,  it  also  began  using  recycled  cotton  for  certain leather goods items.\n- \u00b7 Brioni offers a selection of GOTS-certified products, including in particular shirts, denim and knitwear.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  materials  were  added  to  the Kering Standards in 2018, and are peer-reviewed and to a very large extent follow the logic and requirements of Canopy, an environment-focused  NGO  that  works  to  protect  the  world's forests,  species  and  climate.  In  addition,  in  2018,  Canopy launched  ForestMapper,  a  Kering-funded  initiative  to  create the  first  interactive  map  tracking  ancient  and  endangered forests, thereby providing businesses with tangible decision-making  support  for  their  purchases  of  paper, packaging,  wood  and  cellulosic  textiles.  The  Group  and  its Houses source primarily from suppliers that have achieved the 'green'  level  (score  above  20)  under  the  Canopy  Hot  Button Ranking methodology, as well as FSC-certified cellulosic fiber.\n\nIn 2021, viscose accounted for approximately 5% of ready-to-wear raw  materials,  and  in  total  less  than  1%  of  the  Group's  raw material  purchases,  obtained  primarily  from  suppliers  Enka, Lenzing, Eastman, Aditya Birla and Jilin.\n\nAnother major challenge for the textile sector is the large-scale recycling  of  mixed  fibers,  especially  those  containing  cotton and  cellulose.  Kering  is  looking  into  a  number  of  recycling technologies  and,  in  September  2020,  joined  forces  with Fashion For Good for the 'Full Circle Textiles Project: Scaling Innovations in  Cellulosic  Recycling'  to  research  economically viable  and  scalable  solutions  for  chemical  recycling  of cellulose  to  enable  a  closed-loop  system  to  convert  textile waste  -  cotton  and  cotton  blends  -  into  new  man-made cellulosic fibers.\n\n- \u00b7 Houses such as Alexander McQueen and Saint Laurent are continuing  to  gradually  incorporate  sustainable  cellulosic fibers into their collections.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga's  teams  are  giving  preference  to  sourcing FSC-certified  viscose  and  lyocell,  working  primarily  with suppliers such as Enka and Lenzing (Tencel, EcoVero, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Meanwhile, at Bottega Veneta, certified viscose was used in the Pre-Spring 2020 collection, as well as a new sustainable material composed of a mixture of cork and fennel waste from  the  agri-food  sector,  produced  entirely  in  Europe. Certified or recycled viscose accounted for 70% in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Brioni uses GRS-certified cupro for its linings.\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci continues to increase the proportion of viscose from CanopyStyle  certified  suppliers  (FSC,  GRS).  The  House  is developing alternatives, such as recycled materials (around  30%)  or  using  cellulosic  fibers  from  sustainably managed  forests  (52%),  representing  a  total  of  82%  of viscose from certified or recycled sources.\n- \u00b7 FSC-certified  products  are  also  the  preferred  option  for packaging and paper (see section 3.2.4).\n\nKering's  strategy  on  sourcing  wood-based  products  (cellulosic materials, viscose, etc.) with an impact in terms of deforestation is described  in  Kering's  responses  to  the  CDP  Forests  2021 Questionnaire,  available  at  www.cdp.net.  It  sets  out  the Group's  governance  with  respect  to  these  materials,  risk management and the Group's objectives and performance.\n\n## 4.2.2.4 Animal textile fibers\n\nAnimal  fibers  such  as  wool  are  the  material  with  the second-greatest  impact  in  Kering's  EP&L  and  are  central  to many initiatives taken by the Group and its Houses. Kering and the  MIL  accordingly  continued  to  identify  new  sources  of high-quality fibers that meet the Group's standards, especially as regards farming practices and animal welfare.\n\nTeams from Kering and the Houses have carried out numerous farm visits in recent years, notably to farms raising sheep for their  wool  in  Australia  and  Italy,  but  they  could  not  be sustained at this level in 2021 due to the global health crisis. As  in  2020,  Kering  focused  on  active  engagement  with  the various  potential  and  existing  suppliers  to  assess  and  assist them in improving their sustainable environmental, biodiversity, and animal welfare management practices. Kering also provides expertise for various wool sector initiatives aimed at developing certifications and sustainable wool production methods, such as  the  Responsible  Wool  Standard,  the  Responsible  Mohair Standard  and  the  Responsible  Alpaca  Standard,  and  also continues  to  work  with  experts  in  farming  and  sustainable land  management  practices,  such  as  the  Savory  Institute,  to promote the most demanding management standards for wildlife and biodiversity conservation among sheep farmers, as well as pastoral practices allowing soil regeneration.\n\nA fabric synonymous with luxury, cashmere has been the subject of research and experimentation to improve the environmental footprint  of  its  production.  In  2015,  Kering  and  the  Wildlife Conservation Society, an international NGO, launched the Gobi Desert  Cashmere  program  in  the  Gobi  region  of  southern Mongolia to promote sustainable and traditional production of high-quality cashmere in partnership with two cooperatives of nomadic herders representing 160 families and 150,000 hectares of  pasture  in  \u00d6mn\u00f6govi  province.  In  addition  to  developing the  capacity  of  farmers  to  produce  better  quality  wool,  the program  focuses  on  pastoral  techniques  such  as  rotating herds  in  order  to  improve  the  impact  on  biodiversity  and animal welfare. Kering is also a member of the Market Sector Advisory Group formed on the initiative of the United Nations Development  Program  (UNDP),  which  works  with  other stakeholders  in  Mongolia  to  promote  harmonization  and facilitate  collaboration  between  various  existing  programs there to support the emergence of a sustainable supply chain.",

        "page_content": "Kering's  sustainable  cashmere  program  is  now  a  notable source of high-quality cashmere for the Group's Houses, as it meets  the  animal  welfare  and  biodiversity  conservation criteria  laid  down  in  the  Kering  Standards,  with  the  added bonus  of  reducing  the  environmental  footprint.  More  than 25 metric tons of responsible cashmere have therefore been integrated  into  the  supply  chains  of  the  Group's  Houses since 2015.\n\nIn  terms  of  cashmere  from  farms  in  China  (Inner  Mongolia), in  2021,  Kering  joined  the  Good  Cashmere  Standard,  which promotes  farming  practices  that  meet  demanding  animal welfare requirements.\n\nIn a complementary effort to increase efficiency that reduces pressure  on  the  already  degraded  areas  of  the  Gobi  region, certain Houses including Gucci and Balenciaga use cashmere fibers from production scraps thanks to an innovative process to  recover  scraps,  which  are  sorted  by  quality  and  color  and then transformed into regenerated cashmere fiber. Depending on  the  collection  and  the  level  of  quality  required,  a  certain percentage of virgin fibers can be added before the spinning stage. The  whole  process  takes  place  in  Italy; it is environmentally friendly and fully traceable. Gucci introduced this innovative cashmere fiber in its ready-to-wear collections in 2016, and, along with Balenciaga, has continued to use it.\n\nKering supports certified organic silk production that provides better  traceability  and  a  reduced  environmental  impact. In 2019, the Group released its silk requirements in the second version of its Kering Standards. To ensure their adoption, the MIL  has  established  a  purchasing  platform  with  the  main suppliers of certified silk to guarantee access for the Group's Houses to this high-quality fiber.\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci  is  continuing  to  increase  the  proportion  of  fibers aligned with the Kering Standards by means of a number of responsible  supply  sources:  GOTS-certified  silk  (20%), SFA-certified cashmere (22%), GRS-certified recycled materials (22%) or from regenerative agricultural practices via  Gobi  Desert  Cashmere  (4%).  It  is  also  continuing  to introduce  GOTS-certified  organic  wool  (22%),  GRS-certified recycled wool and certified wools guaranteeing regenerative agricultural  practices  and  the  consideration  of  animal welfare  via  ZQ  (2%),  RWS  (7%)  and  SustainaWOOL  (4%) certification.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, Balenciaga continued to introduce small quantities of organic wool (GOTS or RWS-certified) and recycled wool (GRS-certified),  ZQ-certified  merino  wool  (guaranteeing regenerative agricultural practices and the consideration of animal  welfare),  regenerated  cashmere  and  organic  silk (GOTS-certified)  into  its  collections.  It  has  also  launched trials into replacing the synthetic materials usually used in tailoring  for  shoulders  and  panels  with  a  100%  natural material, Cloudwool, developed by startup Doppelhaus. The wool  comes  from  UK  regenerative  farming  that  respects animal welfare; it is then processed and transformed into a\n\nnon-woven material suitable  for  padding  using  a  completely eco-friendly, more energy efficiency process that does not require water or chemical products.\n\n- \u00b7 Likewise, Alexander McQueen is increasing the share of organic wool,  ZQ-certified  wool  and  organic  silk  in  its  collections, while MCQ uses regenerated wool and cashmere. The House is  also  working  with  its  suppliers  to  give  preference  to sourcing certified cashmere (SFA, GCS), as is Brioni, whose collections  include  a  selection  of  items  in  RWS,  ZQ  and Nativa WOOL-certified wool. Bottega Veneta has also introduced organic wool since its pre-spring 2020 collection.\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent is also continuing to source more and more wool  from  farms  that  protect  the  environment  through management  systems  that  ensure  the  regeneration  of rangelands  and  follow  best  practices  in  terms  of  animal welfare. In particular, the House promotes RWS certification, the  most  advanced  animal  welfare  standard  in  the  wool industry. For example, some of Saint Laurent's iconic jackets are  made  from  wool  bearing  this  certification.  In  2020,  it began to introduce responsible cashmere into its collections, with  40%  of  silk  and  wool  coming  from  certified  sources (GOTS, ZW or RWS) in 2020. In 2021, cashmere from sustainable certified  sources  accounted  for  48%  of  the  House's  total volume, mainly as a result of the collaboration with Kering within the framework of the Gobi Desert Cashmere project. In  South  Africa,  Saint  Laurent  has  set  up  a  sustainable impact platform aiming to encourage supply chain partners to adopt regenerative agriculture and responsible breeding practices. This project is based  primarily on laser technology  to  ensure  the  traceability  of  lambskins  from farm to finished product.\n\nThe Houses are also working on the traceability of their wool supplies.  Brioni,  for  instance,  is  working  with  one  of  its suppliers  in  Australia,  while  Saint  Laurent  launched  a  pilot project based on Oritain and blockchain technologies in 2019 to trace mohair supplies from farms in South Africa. Rolled out since  2020  across  nearly  all  of  its  mohair  supplies,  the method is based on three pillars: mohair certification (CSM or RMS), secure data traceability thanks to blockchain; and data verification  with  Oritain,  using  'fingerprints'  that  are  specific to each farm.\n\n## 4.2.2.5 Precious skins\n\nBecause precious skins such as crocodile and snake skin are important raw materials for Kering, the Group places a strong emphasis on sustainable sourcing that also meets the strictest animal  welfare  standards.  Over  the  past  seven  years,  Kering and  its  Houses  have  supported  a  range  of  initiatives  on sustainable  supply  chains  for  crocodiles  and  pythons.  These initiatives  combine  the  Houses'  Sustainability  Departments and the Group's operations division (which manages its own tanneries and incoming supplies) and various outside experts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group  and  its  Houses  comply  with  national  and international  legislation  and  regulations  on  the  trade  of precious skins: all skins of species catalogued as endangered or  vulnerable  by  the  Convention  on  International  Trade  in Endangered  Species  ('CITES')  are  obtained  with  certificates attesting to their legal origin, issued by CITES and the export authority, to ensure that trade does not threaten endangered species.  In  2021,  the  Group  was  forced  to  suspend  its verification activities in the field because of the public health situation, particularly in Southeast Asia, but continued to help species-specific  international  associations  working  on  the ongoing improvement of sustainable trade and use of exotic leather. In particular, Kering continues to actively support the development of industry standards for all exotic species, such as crocodilians, ostriches and reptiles from Asia:\n\n- \u00b7 In 2021, Kering continued to provide financial and technical support  to  the  Southeast  Asian  Reptile  Conservation Alliance (SARCA), which specializes in ethical and sustainable trade in reptiles in  Southeast Asia.  SARCA is  a multi-stakeholder platform that brings together key players in  the  reptile  trade,  including  luxury  brands,  tanneries, CITES,  scientists  and  conservationists.  SARCA  operates  a study  and  research  program  in  Indonesia,  China,  Malaysia and Thailand to gain a better understanding of the various sustainability  challenges  generated  by  the  trade  in  reptile skins, particularly with regard to natural habitat and animal welfare.  Players  in  the  Kering  value  chain  were  also provided  with  training  on  both  matters.  In  2021,  SARCA's work included finalizing a common  standard for responsible trade of various species of snakes and lizards used  in  luxury  sector  supply  chains  (Responsible  Reptile Sourcing Standard -RRSS) covering four modules: commercial  integrity,  animal  welfare,  and  social  and environmental  responsibility.  To  ensure  that  the  RRSS  is robust  and  exhaustive,  SARCA  implemented  a  multiparty consultation  process  in  2021  to  provide  information  and make the standard more credible,  in  accordance  with  the guidelines of the ISEAL Alliance. SARCA has also identified and mapped out a representative group of stakeholders to take part in the consultation process, based on a sample of types of stakeholder (science/university, regulators, industry,  NGOs,  international  development  organizations) and areas of expertise (for example, human rights and labor rights, animal welfare, conservation, politics/economics).\n- \u00b7 Kering's exotic tanneries are members  of  the  ICFA (International Crocodilians Farmers Association), a non-profit organization  created  to  develop  and  improve  crocodile breeding  practices  that  respect  animal  welfare,  the environment, and local people and communities. The ICFA has established itself as the leading name in developing a culture  of  ongoing  improvement  in  animal  welfare  and supporting  scientific  research.  One  of  the  results  of  this approach is the development, implementation and certification of an international standard (ICFA 1001: 2019 Crocodilian Farming -Requirements) focusing on sustainable  breeding  and  animal  welfare  at  all  stages  of production. In accordance  with  this,  Kering's exotic tanneries only obtain supplies from ICFA certified farms.\n\nLastly,  Kering  contributed  to  the  drafting  of  animal  welfare standards  for  the  South  African  Ostrich  Business  Chamber\n\n(SAOBC),  which  were  made  public  in  2020  and  gradually implemented in 2021. These standards are based on existing codes of conduct and the state of the art, and aim to provide a detailed  and  verifiable  best  practice  audit  program.  They  are for  the  most  part  aligned  with  Kering's  own  Animal  Welfare Standards for ostriches.\n\n## 4.2.2.6 Furs\n\nIn  September  2021,  Kering  made  the  decision  to  stop  using animal fur. Starting from the Fall 2022 collections, none of the Group's Houses will be using fur. Following Gucci in 2017, all the Group's Houses - in particular Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Brioni and Saint Laurent - have gradually decided to take this step.\n\n## 4.2.2.7 Metals, stones and other precious materials\n\nIllegal or unregulated mining can give rise to major social and environmental damage.  Small-scale extraction work in particular can endanger communities by causing serious health and  environmental  damage  if  unregulated,  whereas  properly managed  mining  can  generate  responsible  development  for local  communities. Kering is therefore committed to limiting its purchases to metals and precious stones obtained through activities that minimize harmful impacts on the environment and generate opportunities for local communities.\n\nTo encourage its Houses to source responsible gold (RJC Chain of Custody recycled gold, or Fairtrade and Fairmined-certified artisanal  gold  with  verified  and  traced  provenance)  from selected  partner  refiners,  Kering  adopted  a  dedicated  buying strategy,  the  Kering  Responsible  Gold  Framework  (KRGF), in 2015. The goal is to support responsible gold producers and contribute  to  their  growth,  but  also  to  support  mining communities through the Kering Gold Fund. For each kilogram of  gold  purchased  via  the  KRGF,  the  Group's  Houses  pay  a premium  used  to  endow  the  fund.  Each  year,  a  committee composed of representatives of Kering and its Houses selects projects  to  be  supported  through  the  Kering  Gold  Fund  in favor of mining communities offering social and environmental benefits. Proof of the platform's success is that responsible  gold  purchases  totaled  2.5  metric  tons  in  2021, bringing  the  volume  of  responsible  gold  purchased  to  more than 8.5 metric tons since the platform was launched.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2021, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Pomellato, DoDo, Qeelin and Boucheron used responsible gold for all of their Jewelry, as did Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin for  their  Watches.  Kering  Eyewear  obtains  its  gold  from  a certified (RJC CoC, CoP) recycled gold supplier.\n- \u00b7 Pomellato also made a commitment in 2021 to buy 10 kg of Fairmined gold from the Cruz Pata mining organization to support it after obtaining certification.\n- \u00b7 Saint  Laurent,  Bottega  Veneta,  Gucci  and  Balenciaga  also demand that their gold suppliers for leather goods are part of  the  KRGF.  All  gold  used  by  Gucci  for  plating  its accessories is RJC CoC certified.",

        "page_content": "In  2021,  the  Kering  Gold  Fund  provided  support  for  two projects in partnership with mines:\n\n- \u00b7 In  French  Guiana,  Kering  is  taking  part  in  the  first  full reforestation  program  for  mining  sites  in  the  Amazon rainforest. This pilot project covers 34 hectares located on alluvial  gold  mines  in  the  process  of  closing,  bringing together  Kering  with  Solicaz  (reforestation  experts)  and Forest  Finance  France  (experts  in  the  development  and management  of  reforestation  initiatives),  and  resulting  in the  reforestation  of  all  former  alluvial  mining  sites.  This innovative partnership goes beyond regulatory requirements, under  which  only  30%  of  the  mined  surface  must  be restored  -  not  enough  to  allow  the  reforestation  of  the Amazon. For the first time, ecological aspects are taken into full  account  with  100%  reforestation.  In  all,  more  than 90,000 trees prepared in nurseries with ecological engineering based on biomimicry have been planted on degraded sites. In addition, gold from these responsible alluvial mines has been purchased by Kering brands for use in their products since 2019.\n- \u00b7 In Ghana, Kering and NGO Solidaridad are working together to help women in mining communities gain more autonomy. On-site Solidaridad teams are helping 150 women living in five mining  communities  to  develop  their  skills  and confidence  to  create  their  own  business,  as  well  as  to organize  themselves  into  cooperatives  with  a  view  to obtaining  local  permits,  concessions  and  funding.  The training covers  such  topics  as  negotiation,  business management, health  and  family  planning.  Men  from  local communities  are  stakeholders  in  these  groups  to  ensure acceptance  of  the  project  and  a  genuine  opportunity  for women's  empowerment.  The  project  also  includes  the establishment of a microfinance fund.\n\nFollowing this successful experience with gold, Kering worked in  2021  on  adopting  similar  programs  for  silver  with  the pre-qualification of RJC CoC recycled certified metals.\n\nThe Group's recommendations also cover the use of palladium for  plating  metallic  items  in  leather  goods,  accessories  and shoes.  This  metal  is  used  primarily  by  Gucci,  Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and Alexander McQueen. Furthermore, since  2018,  Gucci  has  developed  an  innovative  partnership enabling it to use palladium recycled from catalytic converters used  in  medical  applications.  This  recycled  palladium  is produced  at  an  RJC  CoC-certified  plant  in  Italy,  ensuring  full traceability of this precious metal. Recycled palladium covers 100% of Gucci's needs.\n\nKering  is  working  with  its  suppliers  to  ensure  that  all diamonds  used  in  its  products  comply  with  the  Kimberley process,  which  aims  to  ensure  the  legality  of  trade  on  the international  market,  so  that  it  does  not  serve  to  finance rebel-armed conflict. Kering has also worked with its Houses to roll out guidelines and best practices on the traceability and sustainable sourcing of diamonds. Pomellato and Boucheron, for  example,  update  the  information  provided  on  their diamond suppliers annually.\n\nTo  go  further,  the  Group's  main  Jewelry  Houses,  like  Ulysse Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux,  have  joined  the  Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), an international organization aiming to establish  responsible  and  transparent  business  practices  in the  precious  metals  trade.  RJC  certification  attests  to  a company's  ethics,  respect  for  the  environment  and  working conditions in the jewelry and watchmaking sectors. It ensures supply  chain  transparency  for  diamonds,  gold,  platinum  and colored  gemstones,  from  the  mine  to  the  point  of  sale.  It  is rooted  in  ILO  and  Global  Compact  principles,  as  well  as  the OECD's  recommendations  on  due  diligence.  Pomellato  and DoDo,  Boucheron  and  Gucci  (which  is  also  RJC  CoC-certified) are  RJC-certified.  Boucheron's  RJC  CoP  certification  was renewed  in  2020.  Ulysse  Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux  are  in the  process  of  obtaining  certification.  For  example,  the emeralds  and  rubies  used  by  Pomellato  are  sourced  from  a responsible  gemstone  producer,  and  since  July  2021  it  has sourced  only  RJC  CoC  certified recycled silver. Lastly, Boucheron is also involved in mother-of-pearl supply projects with suppliers certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.\n\nThe  Houses  also  make  use  of  other  lower-impact  processes: Saint Laurent has been using physical vapor disposition (PVD) coating  on  stainless  steel  for  several  years  now,  for  certain metal parts on its leather goods. Brass is being phased out in favor  of  steel,  which  has  a  lower  environmental  impact.  And the  steel  is  stabilized  using  PVD,  a  vacuum  metallization process that deposits thin films of material in vapor form, and has  a  much  lower  environmental  impact  than  classic electrolytic plating processes.\n\nKering  was  one  of  the  founding  members  in  2015  of  the Coloured  Gemstones  Working  Group  (CGWG),  an  initiative bringing together prestigious Jewelry Houses with the aim of fostering greater transparency  and  positive  social  and environmental  impact  in  the  colored  gemstone  industry. Boucheron  also  supports  and  is  part  of  this  working  group. The  CGWG  develops  resources  and  tools  that  are  made available  free  of  charge  to  all  players  in  the  sector,  enabling them  to  identify,  avoid  and  manage  the  risks  and  impacts inherent  to  their  activities.  In  2020,  the  CGWG  posted  a common vision online and the first round of the new tools on the  community  platform.  Kering  and  its  Houses  worked actively on pilot projects for the tools developed by the CGWG and encourage suppliers to use the platform.\n\nFinally, in 2021, Kering and Cartier - mandated by Richemont -  launched  the  'Watch  and  Jewellery  Initiative  2030'  in partnership  with  the  Responsible  Jewellery  Council,  to  bring together watch and jewelry companies from around the world on the basis of a shared set of key sustainability targets, while also  focusing  on  three  main  priorities:  building  climate resilience,  preserving  resources,  and  fostering  inclusiveness. The initiative is firmly committed to supporting transparency with the requirement of regular reporting on progress made. It will also  help  members  to  respond  to  the  growing expectations  of  stakeholders,  in  particular  customers,  civil society and regulators, with regard to exemplary environmental, social and ethical practices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2.2.8 Plastics\n\nThe use of plastics in the Houses' products is governed by the Kering  Standards.  In  particular,  Kering  has  had  a  zero-PVC product  policy  in  place  since  2012.  In  addition,  the  Houses must  favor  plastics  with  recycled  content  or,  failing  that, certified  bio-based  content,  and  ensure  that  the  chemicals used comply with the Group's MRSL and PRSL. For the product end-of-life phase, the Kering Standards emphasize recyclability.\n\nBecause of the very many alternatives to plastic available, it is not easy to compare  environmental  performances  or understand  supplier  claims.  This  is  why  Kering  regularly organizes  working  sessions  on  these  subjects.  In  2021, particular  effort  was  made  to  review  existing  standards  and certifications  concerning  the  recycled  and  bio-based  content of plastics and their end-of-life phase (recyclability, biodegradability and compostability).\n\nBtoB packaging nevertheless remains the main use of plastic for the Group. Based on a map of plastic consumption plotted in 2017  for  ready-to-wear  packaging  and  logistics  to determine its level of compliance with the Kering Standards, the  Group  has  implemented several substitution projects for recycled plastics since 2018. At the end of 2019, Kering joined the  Circular  Polybag  Pilot,  the  first  Fashion  For  Good  pilot project on this issue, which aims to create a circular solution for  polybags in the fashion industry. In 2020, the centralized logistics  teams  worked  to  remove  any  plastic  that  could  be replaced with certified cardboard from e-commerce shipments. The impact of microfiber pollution on human health and the environment is a major concern for the textile industry. These impacts have not yet been fully quantified but it is clear that a high percentage of microfiber pollution in the oceans and in the air comes from clothing, not just synthetic fibers but also natural fibers. Kering is aware of these impacts and is working on eliminating use of toxic  chemical  products  and  removing microfibers and microplastics from its production processes.\n\nTo  do  this,  Kering  joined  forces  in  2021  with  The  Microfibre Consortium  as  part  of  a  collaborative  approach  between manufacturers and brands to highlight the growing need for better  understanding  of  microfiber  pollution  and  its  adverse effect on aquatic environments and air quality. The consortium  is  calling  for  the  sector  to  measure,  map,  guide and reduce levels of microfiber release.\n\nThe  Materials  Innovation  Lab  (MIL)  launched  a  pilot  project in 2021 to trial an industrial-scale microfiber filtration system in  Kering's  supply  chain.  The  results  and  feedback  from  this pilot  project  will  be  used  to  optimize  and  further  refine  the filtering  process  and  validate  the  effectiveness  of  microfiber capture. The results will also be made available to the rest of the industry.\n\nThe Group firmly believes that the best solution is to prevent microfiber  leakage  as  early  on  as  possible  in  the  product lifecycle, first of all by working on eco-design, for example using the  best  quality  material  and  more  sustainable  long-term fibers, with specific fabric structures, materials compositions, fibers, threads and  dyeing  processes  to  create  more sustainable products, as well as limiting microfiber release.\n\nThe approach to eliminating microfibers needs to be open and collective. Kering also requires its suppliers to comply with its Sustainability  Principles,  including  implementing  mitigation measures to reduce microfiber leakage during the manufacturing phases, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 prefer continuous and/or reinforced fibers;\n- \u00b7 use dyeing, finishing and cutting process that preserve fiber yarn strength and reduce fiber irregularities;\n\n- \u00b7 choose  washing  processes  that  reduce  microfiber  leakage (closed-loop or microfiber filters);\n- \u00b7 increase pre-washing and filtering of the finished product at the manufacturing plant.\n\nThe MIL also offers a range of plastic materials compliant with the  Kering  Standards  to  enable  the  Houses  to  incorporate more responsible plastic into their collections. The Houses are continuing  to  reduce  the  proportion  of  synthetic  materials used  and  gradually  incorporate  new  alternative  materials  as well as more responsible synthetic fibers into their collections, made from biomaterials or recycled:\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Brioni and Balenciaga collections are using a growing proportion of ECONYL\u00ae. In 2021, 26% of nylon used by Gucci was recycled. Gucci was the first of the Group's  Houses  to  use  ECONYL\u00ae  regenerated  nylon  in  its ready-to-wear collections. In support of a continuous loop approach,  ECONYL\u00ae  scraps  have  been  recovered  from  the production processes of Gucci's Off the Grid products and recycled  to  create  new  ECONYL\u00ae  materials  as  part  of  the Gucci-ECONYL\u00ae  Pre-Consumer  Fabric  Take  Back  Program since 2018. Since its Spring 2022 collection, Saint Laurent has  also  used  ECONYL\u00ae  for  its  carryover  backpacks,  while Balenciaga  uses  it  in  its  men's  ready-to-wear  collections and, like Alexander McQueen, in certain accessories such as umbrellas.\n- \u00b7 Meanwhile, Balenciaga is stepping up the development and incorporation  of  recycled  polyester  into  its  ready-to-wear and leather goods collections.\n- \u00b7 Since 2015, Gucci has been gradually replacing the plastic used  on  the  heels  of  its  shoes  with  recycled  ABS  plastic. In 2021, it made 558,000 pairs of shoes with soles made of 30% bio-based TPU. The House is involved in a number of projects to allow for the large-scale production of recycled or bio-based sustainable components in its shoe collections.  These  are  found  primarily  in  the  Gucci  Tennis 1977 and Ace sneakers, or in the heels of Marmont sandals.\n\n## 4.2.3 Animal welfare: the Kering Animal Welfare Standards\n\nKering  believes  that  the  products  developed  by  its  Houses must meet the highest standards of quality in all aspects of production, including those related to the welfare of animals supplying many of the materials used by the Houses.\n\nWith  this  in  mind,  Kering  published  its  Animal  Welfare Standards  in  2019,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  the  highest standards of animal welfare across the Group's supply chain. They  cover  all  the  species  featuring  in  the  Group's  supply chains  around  the  world,  namely  cattle  and  calves,  sheep, goats,  ostriches,  crocodiles  and  alligators,  pythons,  and mammals bred for their fur (decision made in 2021 to end this practice). For each  of  these  species,  the  open-source Standards  highlight  the  specific  challenges,  laying  down breeding,  transportation  and  slaughtering  requirements,  and provide the list of existing certifications serving as benchmarks.  In  addition  to  this  multi-species  document, Kering  has  published  more  detailed  individual  Standards  for cattle,  calves,  sheep  and  goats,  as  well  as  guidelines  for slaughterhouses.  In  2021,  these  Standards  were  updated  to reflect  changes  in  practices  and  experience  from  visits  and audits within our value chains.",

        "page_content": "Developed  with  input  from  animal  welfare  experts,  farmers and herders, scientists and NGOs, the Standards are based on the  latest  scientific  research,  as  well  as  prevailing  legislation and standards,  best  management practices  and  recommendations from a range of sectors. As such, they are based on external expertise,  including  an  external  review  by  several  specialized associations  such  as  the  Royal  Society  for  the  Prevention  of Cruelty  to  Animals  (RSPCA)  in  2017,  Compassion  in  World Farming (CIWF) and the Fondation Nicolas Hulot pour la Nature et l'Homme (FNH)  in  2018,  and  Welfarm  and Oeuvre d'Assistance aux B\u00eates d'Abattoirs (OABA) in 2021.\n\nThe  Kering  Animal  Welfare  Standards  lay  down  a  number  of requirements for animal management that would significantly improve the welfare of animals in countries around the world if  they  were  adopted  by  the  industry  more  broadly.  They  are structured  in  Bronze,  Silver  and  Gold  tiers  to  provide  clear guidance on critical compliance and with the expectation that the Group's suppliers will make continuous improvements:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Bronze  entry  level  reflects  minimum  requirements, which  equal,  and  in  some  cases  go  beyond,  European legislation.  The  Kering  Animal  Welfare  Standards  notably advocate  that  the  best  practices  put  in  place  by  the European Union are implemented on an international scale, which  would  already  be  a  substantial  improvement  in many  countries  that  have  little  or  no  animal  welfare regulations in place;\n- \u00b7 the Silver level reflects the best practices currently in place worldwide;\n- \u00b7 the  highest  Gold  level  sets  the  bar  for  'best-in-class' practices  that  can  fundamentally  transform  the  industry. Some  of  these  requirements  include:  prohibiting  feedlots and intensive farming in favor of pasture-rearing for better quality of life; promoting regenerative grazing and avoiding 'food competition' with sources of human nutrition, which is a growing  concern  given  the  world's  increasing population;  strict  limitations  on  transportation;  ensuring welfare for working farm animals; and prohibiting the use of sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatments, which avoids the unnecessary  contribution  to  the  rise  of  antimicrobial resistance that is threatening human health.\n\nSpecific audit protocols describing how Kering and its Houses can  measure  their  suppliers'  compliance  with  each  of  the Standards have been developed. The protocols naturally cover livestock rearing, transportation and slaughter conditions, but also  include  broader  criteria  such  as  farms'  environmental performance  and  their  impact  on  local  communities  and people.\n\nA country-by-country risk assessment approach is implemented, based  on  the  Animal  Protection  Index  of  NGO  World  Animal Protection.  It  assesses  the  risks  inherent  to  each  country  in terms  of  animal  welfare,  based  on  indicators  such  as  the prevailing legislation and the voluntary commitments existing in the various countries. The level of verification implemented\n\nto ensure compliance with Kering's Standards is then adapted to this level of risk by country, as well as other factors such as the type and volumes of raw materials concerned.\n\nIn  2021,  the  monitoring  and  verification  of  compliance  with animal welfare standards in the Group's various supply chains focused  particularly  on  the  leather  sector.  This  led  to  the establishment of a case-by-case action plan reflecting the risk presented  by  the  countries  of  operation  and  with  regard  to existing  animal  welfare  certifications  for  slaughterhouses. In 2021, a dozen audits were carried out to verify that Kering's animal  welfare  requirements  were  being  met,  primarily  in Italy, Serbia and Turkey.\n\nIn the absence of field visits, a bibliographical evaluation was carried  out  of  a  number  of  standards  and  suppliers  with regard to their approaches to animal welfare, particularly for the wool and leather supply chains.\n\nKering is also working with the sector to improve respect for animal  welfare  and  the  alignment  of  sector  standards. In  2021,  Kering  was  particularly  active  with  the  following groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Southeast  Asian  Reptile  Conservation  Alliance(SARCA)  for precious skins from reptiles from Southeast Asia;\n- \u00b7 International Crocodilian Farmers Association(ICFA) for the precious skins of crocodiles and alligators;\n- \u00b7 South African Ostrich Business Chamber ostrich leather;\n- \u00b7 Textile Exchange with regard to materials from cattle, sheep and goats;\n- \u00b7 Paris  Good  Fashion,  within  which  Kering  has  since  2019 co-led the National Leather Council (CNC), a working group on animal welfare bringing together several major players in  the  French  fashion  and  luxury  sector.  In  2021,  work concerned  primarily  research  into  assessing  the  link between animal welfare and skin quality.\n\nIn addition, in view of the fact that supply chains for many raw materials, including leather, intersect for the luxury and food industries,  Kering  continued  its  partnerships  with  players  in the meat industry in 2021, with a view ultimately to pooling verification efforts and, if necessary, improving practices.\n\nIn  the  fragrances  and  cosmetics  category,  Kering  engages through  licensing  agreements  between  its  main  brands  and leading industry players such as L'Or\u00e9al, Coty and Interparfums to  develop  and  sell  fragrances  and  cosmetics.  It  follows  that Kering and its Houses do not directly manufacture products or conduct  animal  testing  in  this  segment.  The  players  with which Kering and its Houses have signed licensing agreements have  developed  strict  policies  on  animal  testing,  compliant with internationally recognized standards and best practices. Their  approaches  and  requirements  are  set  out  in  their respective reporting documents. In particular, Kering has laid down  specific  requirements  for  fragrances  and  cosmetics  in its Sustainability Principles, available on its website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For Kering, the goal is to establish quality relationships built on trust with all  its  partners,  regardless  of  their  location,  with  a  view  to gaining a full appreciation of their concerns and expectations, and,  as  far  as  possible,  incorporating  these  aspects  into  its strategy.  This  entails  developing  a  policy  of  dialogue  and analysis  of  stakeholder  expectations  at  Group  level,  and encouraging  each  House  to  develop  its  own  platform  for dialogue at a more operational level.\n\n## 5.1.1 Approach at Group level and value chain\n\nThe Group's value  chain,  which  is  structured  around  five  key stages,  from  creation  to  the  customer  experience,  reflects Kering's work with all of its stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It takes part in  a  number  of  initiatives  involving  multiple  stakeholders, such as profession- and sector-specific associations. Kering's contributions to these associations are determined according to a set budget.\n\nThe Group allocated \u20ac1,503,318 to institutional affairs in 2021. The main items were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac70,000  contribution  to  the Association  fran\u00e7aise  des entreprises  priv\u00e9es (AFEP),  which  monitors  French  and European government policies on tax, legal, labor, financial and CSR matters;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac18,333  contribution  to Alliance  France  Tourisme ,  which focuses on tourism policies in France;\n- \u00b7 \u00a360,000 contribution to the British Fashion Council, which focuses  on  developing  sustainable  growth  in  the  fashion industry.\n\nKering's Houses also contributed to the main organizations for fashion and luxury, in France (Comit\u00e9 Colbert, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la haute  couture  et  de  la  mode) ,  Italy (Camera  Nazionale  della Moda Italiana, Altagamma) and the UK (Walpole), in accordance with  their  respective  budgets.  Amounts  were  either  fixed  or proportional to brand revenue.\n\nIn line with Kering's Code of Ethics, no financial contributions were made in 2021 in the name or on behalf of the Group to any political organization in exchange for any direct or indirect material, commercial or personal advantage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are designed and created from unique materials, and are subject  to  rigorous  quality  controls  to  ensure  their  longevity and  durability.  Some  of  the  Houses  offer  their  clients  repair services to maintain the quality of their products and ensure their  longevity.  For  example,  Brioni  offers  its  clients  a reconditioning service, which it promotes via its e-commerce site.\n\nAs part of its commitment, Kering has created specialist repair centers  for  its  customers  in  China  (one  in  Shanghai  and another  in  Hong  Kong)  and  in  the  United  States  (near  its headquarters in Wayne, New Jersey). The aim is to provide a local  service  and  an  immediate  solution  for  its  customers, offering  the  same  services  as  those  provided  by  brands  at their workshops,  thanks  to  qualified  craftspeople  who consider  repairs  to  be  part  of  the  art  of  creating  and  are specially  trained  by  qualified  Italian  technicians  to  carry  out these  repairs.  During  training  courses  run  by  Italian  brand workshops, they learn the techniques needed to make a bag or a pair of shoes. The workshops are also fully equipped with ultramodern machinery. The Group plans to open other repair centers in Dubai and Europe, where its qualified craftspeople will work, with additional support given to suppliers by means of  the  Trecate  logistics  hub  in  Italy.  Kering  already  offers  a resoling service for trainers, and several Houses have launched pilot  programs  for  shoe  cleaning  and  repairs.  Kering's  aftersales service helps to build brand loyalty and forms part of a system designed to extent the lifespan of shoes.\n\nIn addition, the ready-to-wear and leather goods Houses offer a  legal  warranty  as  well  as  a  repair  service  in  the  event  of defects  (a  refund  or  credit  note  may  be  offered  in  some countries).\n\n## 5.2.1.2 Build a business model that gives products a second lease of life\n\nExtending the useful  life  of  products  also  means  looking  for new business models that preserve the value of the product and keep it in the economy. As such, the sale of second-hand products is growing in importance and is a strategic focus for the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 creation  of  Kering  Ventures  whose  purpose  is  to  invest  in innovative new technologies, brands and business models for  the  future  of  the  luxury  sector:  financial  investment in 2021  in  Vestiaire  Collective  (worldwide  pre-owned fashion platform), Cocoon (luxury bag rental service), etc.;\n- \u00b7 Gucci has set up a dedicated department for creating new business  models  and  rolling  them  out  on  a  large  scale, particularly in connection  with  gaming,  vintage  and pre-owned fashion as well as rentals (subscription service), as part of a circular economy approach;\n- \u00b7 in  2021,  Balenciaga  prepared  to  step  up  its  partnership launched  in  2020  with  pre-owned  fashion  specialist Reflaunt  to  enhance  its  impact  and  offers  its  reselling service to more customers as of 2022;\n- \u00b7 Alexander McQueen launched a circularity-based collaboration with  Vestiaire  Collective  in  2021  to  extend  the  lifespan  of its products by making a commitment with its customers.\n\n## 5.2.1.3 Reuse, upcycle, recycle\n\nThe  Group's  products  stand  the  test  of  time  both  physically and emotionally, as a result of which they have a long lifespan and  sometimes  several  users,  as  demonstrated  by  Kering's 2020  study,  'Capturing  the  impacts  of  consumer  use  and product end of life in luxury'. This survey of 3,000 customers in  a  number  of  regions  (United  Kingdom,  Italy,  Japan,  United States)  shows  that  products  from  the  Group's  Houses  are usually resold or given to charity or friends.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  accelerated  its  movement  to  collect products that are no longer used by customers, collectively via Extended Producer Responsibility if the organizational structure  is  in  place  locally,  as  is  the  case  in  France  with Refashion,  or  through  partnerships  such  as  AMQ  x  Vestiaire Collective,  which  offer  a  practical  solution  for  collecting products  that  are  no  longer  used,  while  increasing  products' active lifespan.\n\nTo  limit  the  quantity  of  unsold  products  at  the  end  of  each season,  the  Group  is  investing  in  artificial  intelligence technologies  to  improve  sales  forecasts  and  therefore optimize  production  and  distribution.  The  machine  learning models  put  in  place  to  better  anticipate  seasonal  demand and  current  trends,  thereby  reducing  possible  prediction errors. Particular attention is paid to items likely to generate excess  stocks,  in  line  with  the  Group's  circular  economy approach.",

        "page_content": "In 2021, an 'End of life' chapter dedicated to management of unused materials and unsold or damaged products was added to  the  Kering  Standards.  In  accordance  with  the  hierarchy  of waste  treatment  methods,  this  chapter  states  that  products that are not sold in stores, particularly for quality returns, are then  offered  for  sale  through  channels  dedicated  to  past collections,  such  as  outlets  or  friends  and  family  sales  for employees and their families, or are donated. If products still remain  unsold,  pilot  projects  are  implemented  to  develop upcycling  or  recycling  of  those  items,  together  with  any damaged products. As the destruction of products or unsold items  is  prohibited  throughout  the  Group,  Kering  is  actively working  to  develop  operational  recycling  and  upcycling solutions.  A  procedure  and  a  dedicated  committee  for managing unsold items were set up at Bottega Veneta in 2019. These practices enabled the Group to anticipate France's new anti-waste law, published in 2020, whose Article 35 prohibits the destruction of unsold non-food items from 2022 onwards.\n\nTo  support  and  accelerate  the  development  of  industrial recycling infrastructure, Kering has joined Fashion for Good's 'Full  Circle  Textiles  Project:  Scaling  Innovations  in  Cellulosic Recycling'  initiative,  which  aims  to  test  and  eventually  scale up promising chemical recycling technologies.\n\nKering and its Houses have also launched numerous initiatives and entered into multiple partnerships with schools, associations and recycling organizations to collect waste and scraps  from  production  processes  and  fashion  shows  with  a view to recycling or reusing them:\n\n- \u00b7 Three  years  ago,  Kering  set  up  a  Group-level  partnership with La  R\u00e9serve  des  Arts ,  an  association  that  supports  the cultural  and  creative  sector  in  the  development  of  the circular  and  solidarity  economy.  It  collects  and  reuses materials  from  companies  and  cultural  institutions  in  the Greater  Paris  region  and,  since  September  2020,  in Marseille, and to make them available to its members, all of whom are professionals in the cultural and creative fields. In  2021, La  R\u00e9serve  des  Arts made  18  collections  for  the Group's  Houses  and  ensured  a  reuse  rate  of  87%.  While supporting the cultural and creative sector, the association extends  the  lifespan  of  the  materials  through  their  reuse and  helps  reduce  waste  from  the  sector.  Balenciaga  has also continued with its partnership, particularly within the framework of the relocation of a warehouse.\n- \u00b7 Saint  Laurent  -  for  shoes  -  and  Alexander  McQueen  have developed  pilot  projects  with  Revalorem,  which  offers solutions  for  reusing,  repurposing  and  recycling  unsold items  for  the  luxury  industry.  The  British  House  has  also launched a pilot project with FastFeet Grinded to take apart and  evaluate  the  recyclability  of  400  pairs  of  unsellable trainers.  Most of the materials obtained from this process can be reused as raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent also made several donations to NGOs and fashion schools  during  the  year,  and  organized  private  sales  for employees  to  give  a  second  life  to  stocks  of  fabrics  from previous collections, visual merchandising  tools  and\n\nbenches  used  during  fashion shows. Balenciaga is continuing its partnership with Le Relais ,  a  member of the Emma\u00fcs  network  that  works  to  promote  reintegration through the employment of vulnerable people, for collecting and  recycling  textiles.  More  than  20  tons  of  textiles  have been recycled since 2018 and transformed into ecological building  insulation  known  as M\u00e9tisse. Brioni  also  regularly donates  unused  fabrics  to  international  fashion  schools (including the London College of Fashion and Central Saint Martins)  and  students  at  the Scuola  di  Alta  Sartoria to recycle scraps from previous collections. Saint Laurent has developed  a  recycling  project  for  some  of  its  damaged handbags  through  a  project  with  Vestisolidale,  a  social cooperative  specializing  in  recycling.  The  House  has  also launched a training module on eco-design and upcycling in partnership with the Accademia Costume & Moda in Italy, to raise  students'  awareness  about  circularity  and  offer  a second life to damaged products.\n\n- \u00b7 With  support  from  the  MIL,  Gucci  has  established  an ambitious  collection  and  recycling  program  for  ECONYL\u00ae offcuts. Known as the 'ECONYL\u00ae-Gucci pre-consumer fabric take  back  program',  it  aims  to  maximize  the  benefits  of this innovative material in Gucci's ready-to-wear collections. ECONYL\u00ae is itself a recycled fiber made from plastic waste, much of it recovered from the oceans, and produced in a fully traceable supply chain in Italy. The program relies on the  cooperation  of  Gucci's  suppliers  to  collect  ECONYL\u00ae production  offcuts  and  re-inject  them  into  the  ECONYL\u00ae regeneration  process  in  order  to  re-create  a  high-quality yarn, which is reused in the production of Gucci ready-to-wear collections.\n- \u00b7 The  Scrap-less  project  initiated  by  Gucci  and  involving 13 tanneries, consists of cutting off parts of hides or skins that cannot be used in finished products due to their size or quality before tanning actually takes place. The outcome over the period from 2018 to 2021 was a greatly reduced environmental  impact,  achieved  by  reducing  the  surface needing  to  be  tanned  (50%  reduction  in  scrap  leather), which in turn meant lower carbon emissions (17,187 tCO2 avoided),  as  well  as  reduced  use  of  water  (reduction  of 26 million liters of water), chemicals (reduction of 359 tons, including 67 tons of chrome) and energy (2.1 million kW), and  a  lower  impact  from  transportation.  In  2021,  this proportion amounted to 25% for bovine leather.\n- \u00b7 In  a  similar  vein,  Gucci-Up  is  a  circular  economy  initiative aimed  at  promoting  the  upcycling  of  leather  and  textile offcuts generated during the production process, developed in  collaboration  with  social  NGOs  and  cooperatives.  The project  began  in  2018  and  saw  41  metric  tons  processed between 2018 and 2021. Within this framework, Gucci has also  set  up  a  textile  scraps  recycling  program  with  Green Line,  an  Italian  company  that  specializes  in  the  collection and  recycling  of  fabric  scraps.  Between  2018  and  2021, 445 metric tons of scraps were recycled under this project, in which Brioni also participates.\n- \u00b7 Several Houses  have  also  established  leather  scrap management systems (see section 4.2.2).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the MIL provides House design  teams  with  a  pool  of  sustainable  and  innovative materials  and  assists  them  in  the  selection  of  circular materials.  However,  brands  sometimes  face  technological challenges,  largely  due  to  the  physical  properties  of  recycled materials, which can be less efficient than virgin materials. For example,  recycled  cotton  fibers  are  shorter  and  therefore more  likely  to  fray,  creating  a  conflict  between  product durability and integration of recycled material.\n\nMoreover,  when  virgin  materials  are  required  to  ensure product quality, Kering devises projects to promote a supply of materials obtained through regenerative production practices that  have  no  environmental  impact  and  guarantee  the renewal of resources.\n\n## 5.2.1.5 Partnerships for the circular economy in fashion\n\nIn  the  firm  belief  that  the  transition  to  a  circular  economy requires extensive intra- and inter-sector cooperation, Kering continued  its  involvement  in  2021  in  the  following  three initiatives, which it joined in 2017:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Global  Fashion  Agenda:  in  2021,  Kering  remained  a strategic partner of this organization dedicated to promoting sustainability in the world of fashion. A veritable accelerator of good practices, this platform issued a call to speed up the transition to a circular economy in 2017, and in  2018  published  operational  guidelines  for  achieving circular  fashion.  In  2020,  the  Global  Fashion  Agenda coordinated  the  brands'  work  in  favor  of  new  European laws for more circular fashion;\n- \u00b7 The Ellen MacArthur Foundation: in 2017, Kering contributed  to  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation's  Circular Fibres  Initiative,  whose  major  report,  A  New  Textiles Economy:  Redesigning  Fashion's  Future,  was  published  in November 2017. In 2021, Kering continued to participate by lending  its  expertise  and  resources  to  promote  and co-construct a new vision of the textile industry.\n\n## 5.2.2 Sustainable innovation\n\nTo  significantly  reduce  its  environmental  footprint,  Kering aims  to  stimulate  disruptive  innovation,  transform  its traditional processes and encourage the widespread adoption of more  sustainable  practices. An  illustration of this determination is the Create pillar of its 2025 Strategy, which makes  innovation  one  of  the  drivers  of  the  Group's sustainability  approach.  Kering  is  driving  the  sustainable innovation  strategy  and  setting  up  internal  workshops  and structures,  while  the  Houses  are  developing  innovative initiatives  specific  to  their  businesses  and  priorities.  In addition,  the  Group  is  also  committed  to  an  ecosystem  of organizations spearheading innovation.\n\n## 5.2.2.1 Supporting innovation within the Group\n\n## Partnership with Fashion for Good\n\nKering  became  a  founding  partner  of  the  Fashion  for  Good accelerator in 2017. The aim of this platform is to accelerate innovation in the luxury and fashion industries by factoring in sustainability  criteria  and  supporting  the  development  of startups  through  an  intensive  accelerator  program.  This comprehensive industry-wide innovation ecosystem is expanding:  in  2021,  Fashion  for  Good  accounts  for  20 corporate partners, including fashion groups and brands such as Galeries  Lafayette ,  Target,  PVH  Corp.  and  Adidas,  suppliers and  financial  institutions,  which  take  part  in  pilot  programs, publish  industry  reports  and  provide  support  for  more  than 115 innovators.\n\nThe  program  helps  partners  identify  the  most  compelling innovative  startups  in  the  sector  and  support  them  in  their development. Candidate startups must take a 360\u00b0 approach to  innovation,  focusing  on  three  priority  areas:  the  supply  of raw  materials,  the  manufacture  of  fabrics,  garments  (dyeing, processing,  sewing)  and  accessories,  and  product  end-of-life (recycling, circular economy). The accent is placed on projects and technologies that can help players in the textile industry reduce  their  consumption  of  water  and  energy,  their  waste production  and  their  use  of  chemicals,  alternatives  to  fossil fuels, and help improve their working methods.\n\nOf the 83 pilot projects launched via the accelerator, 18 were coordinated with Kering Houses through the MIL and at Group level. In 2021, these included:\n\n- \u00b7 the  D\u00aeye  Factory  Project  to  trial  innovations  in  the pretreatment  and  dyeing  of  cotton  fibers  and  more specifically denim, wool, polyester and wool-cotton blends, in order to reduce water, energy and chemicals consumption during the dyeing process;\n- \u00b7 the Full Circle Textile Project, launched in 2020 and continued in 2021, involving a consortium of brands, suppliers and innovators working together on textile recycling technologies;",

Development of sustainable textiles\n\n## 2. Responsible supply chain management\n\nOne of the MIL's main activities is launching the development of sustainable special textiles to replace conventional raw materials with alternatives that meet the Kering Standards. To do this, the MIL provides operational mediation between the Houses and suppliers.\n\nThe MIL also supports research into sustainable fabrics and provides technical support.\n\nLastly, consolidation is carried out for each collection in collaboration with the Houses to monitor progress made in meeting the Kering Standards.\n\nThe MIL assists the Houses with sourcing sustainable raw materials (certified silk, organic cotton, wool, cashmere, viscose, etc.) by creating a link between raw materials suppliers (Tier 3 or 4 of the EP&L) and Tier 1 and 2 suppliers of the Group's Houses, mainly located in Italy. To do this, the MIL maps out the supply chains of suppliers and sub-suppliers going back to the primary raw materials, and sets up sustainable raw materials pre-reservation platforms in collaboration with Kering's purchasing teams. Finally, in order to ensure as much traceability as possible for its supply chains, the MIL supports the Houses with tracking certification at each stage of the supply chain.\n\nThe main MIL advances in 2021 were:\n\n- \u00b7 involvement  of  70  yarn  and  fabric  suppliers  using sustainable  materials  in  the  launch  and  follow-up  of 260  specific  developments  concerning  various  materials (cashmere,  wool,  silk,  cotton,  mohair,  nylon,  polyester, viscose, and acetate);\n- \u00b7 dedicated  financial  support  and  technical  training  for 45 key suppliers to support the introduction of sustainable materials into the Houses' collections and obtain certification (GOTS, RWS, GRS, etc.);\n- \u00b7 ongoing  updates  to  the  library  of  fabrics  and  other sustainable  solutions  for  ready-to-wear  and  accessories (textiles,  trims,  non-woven  fabrics,  technologies,  etc.),  and their assessment in light of internal and external standards. More than 300 textile manufacturers are monitored;\n- \u00b7 verification and monitoring of 210 supply chains (for some back  to  the  farm  for  organic  cotton)  related  to  products ordered (yarn, fabrics) in line with the Kering Standards;\n- \u00b7 organization  of  training  programs  for  employees  and suppliers  of  the  Group's  Houses.  For  suppliers,  emphasis has  been  placed  on  traceability,  monitoring  certifications and  certifications  aligned  with  the  Kering  Standards.  For the  Houses,  workshops  were  held  on  fur  alternatives, sustainable denim and 3D knitting with the development of ad hoc samples;\n- \u00b7 the  launch  of  five  main  research  priorities  concerning sustainable denim, fur alternatives, finishes without fluorinated  chemicals,  alternative  fibers  to  cotton  and bioplastics;\n\nThe  partnership  is  also  a  powerful  force  in  building commitment across Group and House teams and startups at the accelerator.\n\n## Materials Innovation Lab (MIL)\n\nKering's  Houses  have  access  to  the  Materials  Innovation  Lab (MIL), opened in 2013 at the heart of the Group's production operations  in  Italy.  It  consists  of  a  team  of  experts  and  a materials laboratory, with three main missions:\n\n## 3. Leading responsible innovation\n\nThe MIL detects, monitors and encourages the incorporation of sustainable textiles innovations by meeting with innovators and assessing their technologies with a view to their being applied by the Group's Houses. Operational pilot projects have been launched concerning new processes and materials in partnership with strategic suppliers to validate, implement and extend innovations within the Houses' supply chains and/or collections.\n\nThe MIL also supports pilot projects from the Fashion for Good accelerator, of which Kering is an active member.\n\n- \u00b7 leading innovation technologies in six areas: recycling and upcycling, materials and substances, finishes and coatings, dyes  and  printing,  production  and  transformation,  global solutions.  A  total  of  41  pilot  projects  were  under  way in 2021, and another 53 being studied and nine finalized.\n\n## Sustainable Innovation Lab (SIL) for watches and jewelry\n\nThe roadmap for the Sustainable Innovation Lab (SIL), set up in  Switzerland  in  early  2020,  is  centered  around  themes  for which  innovation  is  a  way  of  reducing  the  environmental impact associated with watchmarking and jewelry activities: a high  proportion  of  recycled  materials,  partly  bio-based materials,  more  ecological  transformation  processes,  and materials and processes allowing for longer product use. The SIL  also  promotes  the  creativity  generated  by  these  new materials and processes as a result of both their possibilities and their constraints.\n\nA collective approach, bringing together several brands around the  same  topic  and  involving  academic  and  industrial partners at the cutting edge in their field, is essential for the SIL.  This  is  an  effective  way  of  achieving  ambitions  such  as replacing certain metals with composite materials made from natural fibers, making hard materials using less energy-intensive processes,  and  developing  new  metal  alloys.  Research contracts have been entered into with organizations such as Politecnico di Milano and The CNRS Institutes.\n\nBy working as closely as possible with brands, with creatives, technicians  and  manufacturers,  the  SIL  ensures  that  the specifics  of  each  House  are  taken  into  account  in  this collective approach in order to facilitate the incorporation of these technologies into their products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  well  as identifying  innovators  in  sustainable  fashion  in  China,  this award  program  also  seeks  to  educate  the  Chinese  fashion ecosystem  on  the  importance  of  more  responsible  fashion. Following  the  first  program  in  2019,  the  second  in  2021 concerned  specifically  innovation  related  to  biodiversity  for fashion,  covering  four  sub-themes  concerning  water,  land, animal  welfare  and  raising  public  awareness.  The  selection process  included  the  evaluation  of  around  100  innovative projects  by  panels  of  experts,  an  entrepreneurial  capability improvement  workshop  jointly  organized  with  China  Europe International  Business  School  (CEIBS)  for  the  10  most promising  innovations,  and  then  the  selection  of  three winners  by  a  qualified  jury.  The  award  ceremony  was  held during Shanghai Fashion Week on December 6, 2021, and the winners were: Peelsphere, which has developed an innovative bio-based  and  biodegradable  material,  Otex,  which  has developed  an  organic  silk,  and  Zeno  Tech,  which  applies biotechnologies to innovative dyes for fashion. Peelsphere has access  to  a  \u20ac100,000  grant  and  the  three  winners  benefit from mentoring and the networks of the teams at Kering and its Houses, investors, production plants, experts, and steering with the MIL.\n\n## 5.2.2.2 Innovation-oriented initiatives from Kering's Houses\n\nIn addition to Group-level initiatives, the Houses also run their own  innovation-oriented  initiatives,  addressing  their  own activities  and  priorities,  in  line  with  the  objectives  of  the Group's 2025 strategy.\n\nBalenciaga's  Design  and  Development  teams  work  with  a number of startups through the Plug and Play accelerator, and with others identified directly by the House for their work on innovative sustainability solutions (alternative materials, innovative processes and tools, etc.). In response to the clear need  for  closer  cooperation  across  different  functions, Balenciaga  set  up  its  Materials  Innovation  Unit  (MIU)  to mobilize  designers,  developers  and  operations  specialists around common practices and processes. This platform is also useful  for  training  teams  and  putting  them  in  touch  with NGOs  and  experts  from  the  academic  world  on  responsible sourcing  matters  and  sharing  of  best  practices  in  2021,  or circular design in 2020.\n\nSimilarly, Gucci has set up a dedicated department for creating new business models and rolling  them  out  on  a  large  scale, particularly in connection with gaming, vintage and pre-owned fashion  as  well  as  rentals  (subscription  service),  as  part  of  a circular  economy  approach;  Saint  Laurent's  Sustainability Department  works  with  the  materials  research  and  product development  teams  for  its  various  ranges  to  increase  the proportion of sustainable materials in the House's collections.\n\nIn  jewelry,  Boucheron  initiates  highly  supportive  working relationships across its supplier network, forging partnerships with  new  suppliers  with  innovative  know-how  and  providing historic suppliers  with  effective  support  for  developing innovative  new  capabilities.  Pomellato  is  involved  in  a research  project  with  Politecnico  di  Milano  into  3D  printing using powdered gold.\n\nLastly,  Kering  Eyewear's  innovation  approach  comprises  a number  of  aspects  including  the  Virtus  project,  a  data exchange platform using blockchain technology developed to measure  the  environmental  impact  of  its  production  chain and check that each link in the chain meets Kering Eyewear's quality  standards  and  environmental,  social  and  ethical practices. Kering Eyewear also took part in the financing of a prototype  laboratory  initiated  by  Certottica,  the  Italian certification  institute  for  optical  products,  and  the  Treviso Belluno Dolomiti Chamber of Commerce.\n\n## 5.2.3 The Houses' Collections\n\n## 5.2.3.1 Making sustainable materials and processes integral to the product range\n\nTrue  to  the  principle  of  materiality  that  guides  their  actions, Kering  and  its  Houses  have  focused  primarily  on  materials deemed strategic by virtue of their volume, their environmental impacts or their importance in collections (see section 4.4.3). Raw  materials  aligned  with  the  Kering Standards are traced via the EP&L and now account for most of the materials used in products and collections sold by the Houses.\n\nCertain  Houses  are  taking  this  approach  further,  developing sustainable collections and capsule collections, increasing the positive impact of their flagship products and thereby raising client  awareness  of  the  issues  at  hand,  meeting  growing demand for responsible products, and involving clients in the endeavor.\n\n## Focus on: Demetra\n\nIn 2021, after two years of in-house R&D, Gucci launched a new non-animal material as an alternative to leather, produced in Italy. This imitation leather is made mainly from sustainable, renewable and biosourced raw materials of which 77% are derived from plants, such as viscose, cellulose and biosourced polyurethane, all from sustainably managed forests. Demetra production  scraps  will  be  recycled  and  reused  by  the  House  as  part  of  its  Gucci-Up  program.  In  line  with  the  Group's commitment, Demetra is open-source. Gucci launched three new sneakers featuring this material in 2021: Gucci Basket, Gucci New Ace and Gucci Rhyton.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In  2021,  Gucci  added  new  products  to  the  Off  the  Grid collection it launched in 2020. Off the Grid is the first Gucci Circular  Lines  collection,  and  uses  recycled  materials  and textiles  with  the  aim  of  combating  waste  and  minimizing the  use  of  new  resources.  It  comprises  five  product  lines covering  accessories,  ready-to-wear  and  travel  bags,  all made from recycled,  regenerated,  organic  and  biosourced materials from sustainable sources. The lead material in the collection is ECONYL\u00ae regenerated nylon, a 100%-recycled polyamide  material  made  from  fishing  nets,  carpets  and other plastic waste. Other materials are also used (organic cotton,  recycled  polyester,  regenerated  leather,  recycled and  RJC  CoC-certified  gold  and  palladium,  recycled  plastic for  accessories  and  certified  cellulose  fibers).  Leather scraps from the collection are also recovered and recycled under  the  Gucci-Up  program.  In  2021,  the  House  also presented  a  growing  number  of  collections  that  feature sustainable  products:  The  North  Face  x  Gucci,  Gucci  Aria Collection, Gucci 100 and Epilogue Collection.\n- \u00b7 Since its Spring 2022 collection, Saint Laurent has also been making all of its carryover backpacks from ECONYL\u00ae-based nylon.\n- \u00b7 At Alexander McQueen, around 30% of ready-to-wear pieces and  56%  of  accessories  feature  responsibly  sourced materials such as organic wool, silk and cotton, modal and ECONYL\u00ae.  The  House  has  also  launched  a  product  range based on Frumat, a material produced from apples in Italy.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga  is  continuing  to  strengthen  its  sustainable design approach. For example, the House is introducing an increasing  number  of  recycled  synthetic  fibers,  such  as ECONYL\u00ae  and  the cactus-based Desserto, into its collections. 93.5% of the plain materials used in its Summer 2021  collection  were  certified  as  sustainably  sourced  or upcycled,  and  100%  of  printed  materials  were  certified  as sustainably  sourced.  The  impact  of  this  work  on  recycled fibers can be seen in all product categories, and especially key lines such as sneakers: at the start of 2020, Balenciaga released its first 92%-recycled SPEED sneaker. The mesh in its  best-selling  Triple  S  and  Track  sneakers  is  made  from 100%-recycled  polyester.  The  EXPLORER  range  is  fully sustainable. Certain obsolete stock items were also used to make  reusable  tote  bags  as  part  of  the  House's  annual Friends & Family Sales and in the trims of some coats in the Fall 2022 collection. Balenciaga regularly produces capsule collections with non-profit associations and organizations, like  the  WFP  collection  and  the  collection  for  the  Trevor Project in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Following  the  successful  2020  launch  of  its  Puddle  rain boots, made from a biodegradable polymer, Bottega Veneta continued to integrate sustainable materials into its shoes, such  as  Lug  and  Tire.  The  Wardrobe  03  collection  also features recycled buttons and fasteners.\n- \u00b7 Brioni  inaugurated  an  upcycled  capsule  collection  for Spring/Summer  and  Fall/Winter  2022,  covering  several product  categories  (Formal,  Leisure,  Lounge,  knitwear  and accessories). The House also launched a range in Japanese selvedge  denim  made  from  GOTS-certified  organic  cotton and produced using artisanal methods, along with several shoes, tennis shoes and espadrilles made from sustainable materials.  Brioni  continued  to  use  GRS  recycled  fibers  in outerwear  garments  in  its  2022  collections,  for  example\n\nintroducing LUXEPAD upcycled padding made  from cashmere  scraps,  which  has  a  smaller  environmental footprint  in  terms  of  water  and  energy  consumption,  and CO2 and waste production. Information about sustainability is  now  provided  on  separate  labels  for  the  products concerned.\n\n- \u00b7 DoDo  sells  a  bracelet  in  recycled  plastic  as  part  of  its partnership with Tenaka, along with a turtle charm as part of a partnership with the WWF. The House also uses ethical silk produced by local communities in its Dodo Bazaar line.\n- \u00b7 Pomellato  launched  several  responsible  collections:  the Kintsugi upcycled collection, the La Gioia re-loved collection, which focuses on circularity, and the Nuvola ring, crafted  from  ethical  Fairmined  gold  and  set  with  a  fully traceable Greenland ruby to mark Earth Day 2021.\n- \u00b7 Since 2020, Ulysse Nardin has been selling two innovative products designed to have a limited environmental impact and  to  promote  the  House's  commitment  to  the  marine circular economy: the R-STRAP made from recycled fishing nets,  which  are  one  of  the  main  sources  of  ocean  plastic pollution,  and  DIVER  NET,  an  upcycled  concept  watch  in which  each  element  has  been  designed  to  be  as environmentally friendly as possible.\n\nKering's  Houses  are  increasingly  intent  on  measuring  and monitoring  the  performance  of  their  collections  in  terms  of sustainability. Saint Laurent, for example, has developed a set of indicators for tracking the performance of its ready-to-wear categories twice a year with its development teams.\n\n## 5.2.3.2 Raising awareness among our salesforce and informing our clients\n\nIn  addition  to  product  design  and  development,  and  the sourcing  of  raw  materials,  it  is  also  essential  to  take  action and  raise  awareness  of  sustainability  issues  concerning  our products at all stages in the value chain. With this in mind, the Group and its Houses are stepping up training and awarenessraising  operations  for  their  sales  and  merchandising  teams, and in their interactions with clients and consumers.\n\nExamples include the training provided by Alexander McQueen,  Boucheron  and  Bottega  Veneta  regarding  their sustainability strategies, the Group's actions and  their sustainable  product  ranges;  by  Brioni  around  its  Spring/ Summer  and  Fall/Winter  2021  collections  and  its  upcycled capsule  collections;  and  by  the  Gucci  Retail  Academy,  the House's  internal  training  platform  through  which  it  provides specific  training  modules  for  its  sales  personnel  worldwide. Gucci Retail Academy modules have been taken by over 90% of the staff members concerned. In particular, these modules explain  the  environmental  benefits  of  products  that  feature sustainable materials, along with the brand's People & Planet commitments. Over 100 modules were developed to cover the products  in  the  2021  Ouverture  and  Aria  collections.  Brioni introduced  an  online  training  module  in  2021,  as  well  as providing training to its showroom personnel and launching a competition for its sales teams on the theme of sustainability, called  the  Sustainability  Retail  Contest.  Some  Houses  also organized  Kering  Standards  training  sessions  for  their  sales teams in association with Corporate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The system allows the House to assess all ready-to-wear, leather goods and shoes collections across five criteria: traceability of materials, compliance with sustainability standards, environmental impact, social performance and the quality of suppliers' chemical management processes. Green Atelier uses a number of interfaces that allow results to be shared widely in-house, including an app installed on the phones of Bottega Veneta's employees, which shows each product's performance and strengths.\n\n- A  specific  EP&L  module  enables  the  Houses'  design  and development teams to visualize the environmental impact of alternative  design  options  (choice  of  materials,  sourcing countries,  production  processes,  etc.),  along  with  the  most environmentally  friendly  options  in  order  to  guide  design choices towards optimizing the EP&L footprint.\n\nKering's spirit of sharing and its desire to encourage the world of  fashion  to  adopt  more  sustainable  practices  permeate  all the  Group's  Houses,  and  is  expressed  through  initiatives targeting  their  clients  and  the  general  public,  as  well  as through their websites and social media accounts.\n\n- \u00b7 Since  2020,  Gucci  has  posted  sustainability  data  for 400  products  on  its  e-commerce  website  and  Gucci  App. Saint  Laurent  has  also  been  providing  this  information through  product  descriptions  on  its  e-commerce  website since the Fall/Winter 2021 collection.\n- \u00b7 Kering Eyewear, Ulysse Nardin, Girard-Perregaux and Pomellato  all  communicate  to  the  general  public  on sustainability via dedicated pages on their websites, while Brioni communicates via client newsletters. In 2021, Brioni and  Saint  Laurent  also  added  dedicated  sections  on  this topic on their websites, while Balenciaga and Saint Laurent developed dedicated content for their in-house retail apps. In 2021, Gucci published its first Gucci Equilibrium impact report and its Gender Report, complementing the enhanced content  available  on  its  dedicated  website  and  Instagram profile.  The  aim  was  to  highlight  its  ongoing  commitment to  instigating  positive  change  for  people  and  the  planet, and to sharing, engaging and uniting its community around these initiatives.\n\nKering also takes part in work and methodological discussions regarding environmental reporting to consumers, particularly via  work done by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la Haute Couture et de la Mode as  part  of  its  European  PEF  (Product  Environmental Footprint) project.\n\nThe  charter  on  working  relations  with  fashion  models  and their  well-being,  published  in  2017  by  Kering  and  LVMH  and applied  to  all  of  their  brands,  promotes  high  standards  of integrity, responsibility  and  respect  towards  the  people concerned.  As  well  as  paying  particular  attention  to  models' working  conditions,  this  charter  forms  part  of  the  Group's responsible  communication  efforts,  aiming  to  promote\n\nrespect for the dignity of all people and to convey a positive image  to  the  audiences  of  the  Group's  various  Houses, particularly among vulnerable groups.\n\n## 5.2.3.3 Sustainable fashion shows: rethinking fashion shows and managing event footprints\n\nFashion  shows  are  an  essential  part  of  the  operations  of Kering's  Houses,  enabling  them to share their creative vision and  present  new  collections.  They  also  provide  a  unique opportunity  to  raise  awareness  about  sustainability,  and  to mobilize  all  the  parties  involved  (brands,  model  agencies, event organizers, media, etc.) around this important quest.\n\nIn  2019,  all  of  the  Houses  took  up  the  Green  Fashion  Shows internal  guidelines  on  minimizing  the  environmental  impact of  fashion  shows,  while  allowing  the  creative  directors  to express  their  artistic  potential.  The  topics  covered  by  the guidelines  include  governance,  stakeholder  relations,  energy management,  waste  management,  elimination  of  single-use plastics, food and transportation. The procedure for verifying compliance with the guidelines was finalized in 2020.\n\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent, for example, favors materials and equipment that is rented or made from reused materials in its shows. This was particularly the case for the House's Spring 2022 menswear show, which featured Green Lens, an installation by  the  artist  Doug  Aitken  in  Venice,  Italy.  For  that  show, plants  used  in  the  installation  and  more  besides  were replanted  on  the  Isola  della  Certosa  as  part  of  the restoration  project  supported  by  the  House.  Saint  Laurent also  has  a  partnership  with La  R\u00e9serve  des  Arts ,  a  French non-profit  organization  that  collects  various  types  of materials  from  events  and  shows  and  offers  them  to  its affiliates,  artists  and  art  students,  in  accordance  with circularity  principles.  The  House  also  joined  forces  with Ecoact  in  2021  to  measure  the  CO2  footprint  of  its  media campaigns,  creating  a  dedicated  tool  that  helps  it  to identify areas for improvement.\n- \u00b7 2021  marked  Balenciaga's  return  to  Haute  Couture.  Its efforts to minimize the overall impact of its Summer 2022 fashion  show  included  initiatives  in  the  following  areas: waste reduction and sorting; measures to eliminate singleuse  plastics;  the  use  of  compostable  cups  and  plates;  the reuse or recovery of stage materials (wood, steel, synthetic materials, carpets, seating, etc.); the reduction and optimization  of  transportation  for  materials,  merchandise and employees; and carbon offsetting for the entire show via support for a reforestation project. Balenciaga has been working  with  specialist  NGO  Up2Green  Reforestation  and supporting a project based in the Indian province of Gujarat to  offset  the  carbon  emissions  of  its  shows.  More  than 4,000  fruit  trees  have  been  planted  with  a  local  NGO, VIKALP,  which  seeks  to  improve  living  conditions  for  local communities and women in particular.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Gucci  obtained  ISO  20121  certification  for  its  advertising campaigns  and  its  fashion  shows,  both  physical  (such  as Gucci  Love  Parade)  and  virtual.  The  ISO  20121  standard examines  environmental,  social  and  economic  factors  to determine whether an event can qualify as sustainable, and Gucci's  compliance was verified by Bureau Veritas. As well as the Group's charter for fashion shows, Gucci applies its own  standards  -  the  Gucci  Guidelines  for  Sustainable Events - to all  its  events.  In  line  with  Gucci's  approach  to carbon neutrality, all CO2 emissions generated by its shows and their digital broadcasts have been measured and offset as  part  of  the  Natural  Climate  Solutions  Portfolio.  For example, most of the equipment is rented or can be reused, and  Gucci  has  also  formed  a  partnership  with  EcoSet  to distribute  some  of  the  equipment  and  left-over  food  and drink to local communities.\n- \u00b7 The Alexander McQueen Spring/Summer 2022 show, which took place in London in October 2021, was designed with the aim of limiting its environmental impact. It involved a local  network  of  subcontractors  all  based  in  London  and the  surrounding  region,  waste  was  sorted  for  recycling on-site,  equipment  was  rented  or  will  be  reused  in subsequent  shows,  and  power  came  from  generators running on biofuel. Carbon emissions related to the show were measured and offset.\n\nKering also takes part in working groups on this topic, set up by  fashion  industry  associations  and  non-profit  organization Paris Good Fashion. In particular, Kering and its Houses have worked with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and all  the  parties  involved  in  putting  on  a  fashion  show  to develop a tool for measuring the various environmental, social and economic impacts of such events. This tool, a beta version of which was available in late 2020, is now in operation for all Houses holding shows in Paris. It factors in all the operations involved, including digital and media impact.\n\n## 5.2.4 Product quality control, and consumer health and safety\n\nKering is committed to helping raise awareness of sustainability issues among consumers, while ensuring that its products respect both their health and the environment.\n\nTo  enable  clients  to  enjoy  the  products  developed  by  the Houses  safely,  Kering  has  defined  a  set  of  quality  control procedures  that  comply  with  the  strictest  international consumer  health,  safety  and  environmental  standards  and regulations, such as REACH, US CPSIA, China GB Standards and Japan Industrial Standards (JIS). The Natural Climate Solutions Portfolio department aims to pool services, for the purpose of advising and supporting the Houses on product development and  the  various  stages  of  production,  including  product testing  protocols  to  ensure  that  products  comply  with  the local  characteristics  of  each  market.  The  Department  relies primarily on the Product Restricted Substance List (PRSL) and Product  Safety  Requirements,  an  internal  document  listing substances to be removed and thresholds not to be exceeded, as  well  as  requirements  in  terms  of  product  safety.  To  take into  account  the  pace  of  technological  development  and progress  in  chemical  research,  the  PRSL  is  updated  at  least once a year. In particular, it has specific modules for products intended  for  children  in  terms  of  managing  chemical substances  and  safety.  Specific  training  courses  have  been developed and will be provided in 2022.\n\n## Focus on: the Test & Innovation Lab (TIL)\n\nIn  2021,  Kering  strengthened  its  product  testing  system  by  opening  its  Test  &  Innovation  Lab  (TIL)  in  Italy,  an  in-house facility that can carry out all regulatory and other testing of products made by Kering's Houses. The TIL has ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation, awarded by Accredia, for more than 170 testing methods covering both raw materials and finished products. As well as quality control, the TIL also tests innovative materials and identifies solutions to potential problems that the Houses may encounter in the various stages of production.\n\nIn 2021,  the  Product  Compliance  Advisory  Department continued its activities in the following areas:\n\n- 1. Strengthen compliance controls: regular audits of product compliance were conducted at the warehouse level together with  the  Houses  to  detect  potential  non-compliance. Relations  with  laboratories  accredited  to  carry  out  tests and measurements were maintained to cover the growing number  of  material  and  product  categories,  including non-core products (food contact materials, toys, electrical/electronic  devices).  Since  March  2021,  the  TIL has  been  carrying  out  testing  activities  and  providing support for Houses to ensure product compliance.\n- 2. Improve knowledge-sharing on product compliance processes: training programs have been strengthened and extended  to  all  key  departments  (product  development, production, quality and purchasing), from raw materials to production  (leather,  fabric  and  metal  accessories).  In 2020, some 20 training sessions were held (online, due to the  health  crisis),  involving  more  than  400  employees.\n\nThey  addressed  the  key  issues  of  production  processes, compliance requirements and the related controls. Due to the  increasing  complexity  of  the  Houses'  products  and new  environmental  regulations  on  packaging,  there  is  a joint  effort  to  ensure  maximum  accuracy  in  labeling.  To this  end,  the  Product  Compliance  Advisory  Department has created guides and specific training modules, and has rolled out a dedicated IT tool.\n\n- 3. Support  the  Houses'  product  development  teams:  in collaboration with the Chinese authorities, company-specific product  standards  have  been  established  for  Kering's Houses.  These  standards  already  existed  for  handbags, wallets, shoes and belts. They make it possible to develop pieces  that  meet  all  requirements  in  terms  of  health, safety and compliance, while leaving the Houses' creative teams  significant  scope  to  follow  their  inspiration.  In 2021, Kering took the initiative to develop a draft standard for unregulated product categories in China.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This activity consists mainly of analyzing requirements and  laws  relating  to  customs  and  compliance  in  destination countries  for  new  products  and  projects,  working  with  local logistics  teams  and  external  experts  as  required.  By  working with  the  Customs  &  Trade  Compliance  Department  from  the early  stages  of  development,  Houses  can  prevent  risks, penalties and delays, and ensure that the distribution chain is fully  compliant.  Once  requirements  have  been  defined,  the Customs  &  Trade  Compliance  Department  is  tasked  with pulling together and sharing product-related information and documents with regional logistics teams, brokers and clients, checking the consistency of product Master Data managed by the  Houses'  production  departments  and  taking  steps  to correct  potential  errors,  managing  product  certifications  and supplier  audits  by  following  the  standards  established  by international certification authorities, and  implementing appropriate  compliance  procedures,  often  by  directing  other Group  entities.  In  2021,  the  department  dealt  with  almost 30,000 internal requests.\n\nThe  Group  also  has  a  Multi  Brand  After  Sales  Department, dealing  with  quality  assurance  for  products  after  they  have been  sold,  in  accordance  with  House  standards  as  regards value-added services (VASs). Activities include repair management, product checks, on-demand audits, re-labeling and the hallmarking process for jewelry. The department is a single point of contact for the Houses, regardless of where the product is located in the world.\n\nSome Houses also carry out specific work related to regulatory compliance  in  respect  of  hazardous  substances  and  the implementation of the PRSL and MRSL (see section 4.1.4.2). In the same vein, Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin continued to  work  with  the Association  pour  l'Assurance  Qualit\u00e9  des Fabricants  de  Bracelets  Cuir (Swiss  association  of  quality assurance for leather bracelets manufacturers - AQC) on the chemical compliance of leather used in watch straps, with the aim  of  creating  a  certification  label.  Lastly,  Kering  Eyewear uses accredited laboratories with specific expertise in eyewear for its compliance checks.\n\n## 5.3 Involving our ecosystem in creating tomorrow's Luxury\n\n## 5.3.1 Community impact and preservation of know-how\n\nConscious of its responsibility to future generations, Kering is continuing  its  policy  of  academic  partnerships  with  design schools,  business  schools  and  universities  worldwide.  The aims of this policy include raising awareness among designers and future fashion industry leaders regarding the major social and  environmental  challenges  in  store.  Details  of  the  main partnerships are provided in section 3.1.1.2.\n\nIn addition, and in order to ensure that top-level expertise is maintained  and  promoted  within  their  business  activities, certain Houses are developing dedicated training centers and local  partnerships.  These  professional  organizations  help  to ensure the survival of some very demanding and unique skills, and  support  long-term  employment  in  the  regions  where these crafts originated. To date, more than 1,500 people have taken part in these programs and training courses delivered by the Group and its Houses.\n\n- \u00b7 In  2006,  Bottega  Veneta  created  the Scuola  dei  Maestri Pellettieri with  the  aim  of  training  a  new  generation  of leather  craftspeople  to  guarantee  the  continuity  of  its cultural  heritage  and  excellent  craftsmanship.  Located  in the Montebello Vicentino workshop, the school serves as a permanent  training  center  for  Bottega  Veneta  employees and apprentices alike, allowing them to immerse themselves in the craftsmanship and values of the brand. In 2021, sessions related to materials, working techniques, team  management  and  individual  coaching.  They  were provided both virtually and in-person for technical teams. Because of constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic, only  15  people  were  able  to  enroll  in  the  program.  Major efforts  have  taken  place  to  develop  the Scuola dei Maestri Pellettieri , and  Bottega  Veneta  intends  to  offer  more in-person technical sessions in 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 In  order  to  preserve  and  pass  on  Saint  Laurent's  unique expertise and generate new ideas for the future, the House continued the Saint  Laurent  Couture  Institute  program,  in partnership with the Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode (IFM). This 6-month  high-end  training  program  consists  of  several modules in the ready-to-wear category, combining academic  learning,  a  core  syllabus  exploring  the  House's iconic  pieces,  and  on-the-job  learning  with  the  focus  on creativity  and  craftsmanship.  It  gives  around  10  students the chance to develop their skills and learn about fashion. Saint Laurent staff members also take part in this program, in  which  innovation  and  sustainability  play  a  central  role. Overall,  more  than  350  people  have  received  training through the program since 2018.\n- \u00b7 The  Gucci  ArtLab  center  of  excellence,  which  opened in  2018,  brings  together  Gucci's  leather  goods  and  shoes operations  at  an  ultra-modern  site  in  Italy.  The  center's purpose is to preserve the unique know-how developed by Gucci  and  to  instill  technological  innovation  in  order  to optimize production, a key factor underpinning the House's growth.  The  Gucci  ArtLab  also  now  houses  the \u00c9cole  de l'Amour education program, which includes a craftsmanship school (Scuola  dei  Mestieri) ,  offering  a  six-month  program to train students to professional standards; a factory school (Scuola  di  Fabbrica) , which  has  been  training  technical production  operators  for  a  year  now;  and  the  Artlab academy  and  factory (Accademia  Artlab  e  Fabbriche), an ongoing in-house training program that aims to meet the specific  training  needs  of  people  in  various  roles  and working in various production units within Gucci.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In  March 2021, a group of 11 young design students were selected by the Gucci Design Fellowship and enrolled in a program based in Rome, home to Gucci's Creative Director Alessandro  Michele,  consisting  of  12  months  of  cultural discovery and exchange. Inclusivity, diversity, education and cultural  enrichment  lie  at  the  heart  of  this  multicultural program,  which  was  launched  in  2019.  It  forms  part  of the Gucci's Diversity & Inclusion initiative, aiming to develop opportunities  for  under-represented  groups  by  helping budding  designers  in  their  quest  to  gain  professional experience,  raise  their  profile  within  the  world  of  Luxury design and secure their career pathway.\n- \u00b7 Since  2017,  Pomellato  in  partnership  with  the  Galdus Goldsmith Academy has offered a program named Virtuosi, offering a full professional training curriculum over three to seven  years.  Pomellato's  support  takes  the  form  of program  sponsorship,  the  involvement  of  its  experts  in classes  and  seminars,  and  apprenticeships  and  in  some cases internships at Pomellato. The House is also in contact with  a  new  school  for  goldsmiths  in  Gallarate,  Milan province.\n- \u00b7 Between 1985 and 2020, Brioni supported the Scuola di Alta Sartoria ,  offering  a  three-year  course  followed  by  a  oneyear  apprenticeship  at  its  workshops  to  teach  the  Brioni method. More than a hundred tailors graduated from this school  and  are  now  working  for  Brioni,  either  in  its workshops or its boutiques. The House has also formed a partnership  with  the Istituto  Istruzione  Superiore  Vincenzo Moretti di Roseto degli Abruzzi as part of Altagamma's Adopt a  School  program,  of  which  Brioni  is  a  member,  and supported by the Italian ministry for education, in order to encourage  technical  teaching  related  to  the  luxury  and fashion industry among secondary-school students.\n- \u00b7 The  Ulysse  Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux  academic  center opened  in  2002  and  trains  apprentices,  who  can  gain qualifications  such  as  (CFC  watchmaking  or  watch  repair diplomas)  and  immerse  themselves  in  the  universe  and craftsmanship of the two Houses.\n\nThe  Group's  Houses  also  support  craft  guilds  and  undertake local initiatives. Finally, in 2018,  Brioni  integrated  the Arazzeria  Pennese historic  tapestry  production  site  -  one  of Italy's  most  important  tapestry  centers  -  with  its  Montebello workshops  in  order  to  preserve  this  highly  specific  form  of craftsmanship.\n\n## 5.3.2 Conveying our vision for future generations to our international and external stakeholders\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  organize  communication  campaigns around  the  year's  main  announcements  and  commitments: in  2021,  they  included  the  decision  to  stop  using  fur,  the  K Generation  Award,  the  presentation  of  Kering's  Circularity Ambition during the changeNOW summit, the creation of the Watch & Jewellery Initiative 2030 with the RJC, and the launch of the  Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature  followed  by  the announcement  of  the  first  grant  recipients  during  the  IUCN World  Conservation  Congress  in  Marseille.  Kering  and  its Houses also actively support and take part in numerous events and forums focused on sustainability. Through its actions and words  in  this  area,  the  Group  shares  its  vision  of  Kering  for future  generations,  helps  to  raise  public  awareness  about sustainability  issues  and  aims  to  mobilize  the  whole  of  civil society to address these themes.\n\n## \u00b7 Earth Day\n\nTo mark Earth Day on April 22, 2021, Kering launched a unique digital  campaign  putting  the  spotlight  on  the  work  and projects  of  its  Materials  Innovation  Lab  (MIL).  The  Group worked  with  WeTransfer  to  design  an  interactive  screen background based on the idea of a memory game. The game was adapted for WeChat, whose users were invited to play it in order to learn more about the MIL. A social media campaign was  also  devised  to  tell  the  story  of  the  Group's  various materials.\n\n## \u00b7 World Environment Day\n\nOn  June  5,  2021,  to  mark  World  Environment  Day,  Kering initiated  a  social  media  campaign  to  raise  public  awareness about  responsible  gold,  sharing  a  documentary  filmed  in Guyana  about  Kering's  responsible  gold  program,  which addresses both human and environmental issues.\n\n## \u00b7 Prospect 100\n\nKering  supported  Prospect  100,  a  platform  that  organizes competitions  for  project  leaders  aged  under  25  throughout the  world.  In  2021,  Kering  supported  the  sustainable  design challenge,  which  took  place  between  September  7  and  14. Marie-Claire  Daveu,  Chief  Sustainability  and  Institutional Affairs  Officer,  was  part  of  the  expert  jury  tasked  with assessing  the  projects  and  innovations  put  forward.  To promote  the  challenge,  a  live  conversation  took  place  on Instagram with Amber Valletta, model, actor and sustainability activist.\n\n## \u00b7 Kering: partner-founder of La Caserne\n\nLa Caserne opened its doors after two years of building work in September  2021.  It  is  intended  to  become  Europe's  largest accelerator of ecological transition focused on the fashion and luxury industry. Since collective efforts by all industry players are vital if  real  change is to take place within the sector, the Group decided to support this innovative center as partner-founder.  In  particular,  it  will  help  organize  events  to raise  awareness  of  key  industry  issues  among  fashion professionals and the general public.\n\n## \u00b7 Conscious Festival, a fun and educational environmental event\n\nOn  September  24-26, La  Caserne hosted  Europe's  first Conscious Festival, organized by Green Is The New Black. The line-up featured talks about ecoresponsibility and the planet, workshops about how to live more responsibly, art and music. Two  experts  from  Kering's  sustainability  team  spoke  about fashion and biodiversity in round-table discussions, the Group had a Materials  Innovation  Lab  stand  at  the  entrance  to  the festival,  and  an  exhibition  developed  with  The  Sustainable Angle shed light on materials that have a positive impact on nature.\n\n## \u00b7 Biodiversity event in Japan\n\nAn  exhibition  about  fashion  and  biodiversity  took  place  at Kering's  premises  in  Japan  on  November  26-28,  2021. 769  people  visited  the  exhibition,  finding  out  about  the environmental issues facing the fashion industry and Kering's solutions across the whole supply chain, from collecting raw materials to finished products in stores.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  part  of  the  summit's 2021  innovation  hub,  the  Group  presented  a  selection  of startups working on new circular and sustainable materials via the  MIL.  Marie-Claire  Daveu  opened  the  summit  with  a conversation  with  Lorenzo  Albrighi,  co-CEO  and  founder  of Lablaco.\n\n## \u00b7 Kering Circularity Challenge\n\nIn  December  2021,  Kering  organized  a  competition  to  raise public  awareness  about  circular  economy  issues.  For  two weeks,  the  Group  invited  people  to  visit  craftingtomorrows luxurychallenge.com  for  a  chance  to  win  Gucci  and  DoDo prizes.  For  this  first  challenge,  which  related  to  circularity, Kering helped participants learn more about the life cycle of a product and how to make it part of a circular economy: from producing raw materials to giving products a second life, via employing sustainable design and using green energy.\n\n## \u00b7 Revamped sustainability section on kering.com\n\nTo increase transparency and to align Kering's words with its actions regarding sustainability, the Group completely overhauled the sustainability  section  of  its  website,  focusing on the key issues on which its strategy and efforts are based, including  limiting  climate  change,  preserving  the  planet, putting people at the heart of the value chain, and innovating for tomorrow.\n\n## Involvement in targeted events\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's Caring Day has taken place on June 5 for the past six years to celebrate World Environment Day. The event raises employee awareness and is supplemented by various actions within the Houses.\n\nIn-house awarenessraising and training at the Group's Houses\n\n- \u00b7 Communication initiatives (videos, training resources and quizzes) took place around Earth Day in April to raise awareness among Alexander McQueen staff members about issues related to biodiversity and the circular economy.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga 's  Sustainability  Days  and  masterclasses  feature  high-level  guest  speakers,  with  a  flexible format.

The Novara production site also has four beehives on its rooftop.\n- \u00b7 A  partnership  was  established  with  the  No\u00e9  association  regarding  participatory  science  initiatives  to protect butterflies at the Laennec site.\n- \u00b7 Gucci  Education  is  an  e-learning  platform  launched  by Gucci for  its  corporate  employees,  covering topics such as diversity, inclusion and the environment.\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent offers all its employees sustainability training comprising three modules on its in-house E-University platform. A training challenge took place in 2021, to which 1,200 people signed up. A new module to address the most common sustainability questions is  currently  being  prepared.  Reusable water bottles are distributed to all staff members in partnership with the Charity: water NGO.\n- \u00b7 Salespeople and employees with key roles (design, retail and merchandising) receive training to inform them about the Group's sustainability actions, the sustainable products and collections it sells and the Kering Standards, and to share best practice to ensure efficient store management (Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga Brioni, Boucheron, Saint Laurent and Gucci).\n\n## \u00b7 Talking about sustainability\n\nThroughout  the  year,  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  and  the  Kering sustainability team, led by the Group Chief Sustainability and Institutional  Affairs  Officer,  shared  the  Group's  vision,  2025 strategy  and  initiatives  with  various  audiences,  mainly  at virtual events owing to the global health context.\n\nThe  main  venues  for  this  were  the  One  Planet  Summit,  the World  Economic  Forum,  the  Vogue  Business  Sustainability Summit,  ChangeNOW,  the  World  Conservation  Congress  in Marseille, the Circular Fashion Summit, the Ocean Summit and the Women's Forum.

        "page_content": "## 5.4 Initiatives carried out by the Kering Foundation and sponsorship programs\n\n## 5.4.1 The Kering Corporate Foundation is increasing its commitment to combating violence against women through ambitious projects in France and abroad\n\nFormed  in  2008,  the  Kering  Foundation  combats  violence against  women,  across  all  cultures  and  all  social  classes. Worldwide,  one  in  three  woman  is  or  will  be  a  victim  of violence  in  her  life.  The  Foundation  operates  according  to  a five-year program, with Kering providing funding of \u20ac10 million (\u20ac2 million per year).\n\nCombating violence against women is a key issue for Kering, consistent  with  the  operations  and  customer  base  of  its Houses.  Alongside  public  authorities  and  NGOs,  Kering  has  a vital  role  to  play  here,  and  its  commitment  to  this  cause  is channeled  through  the  Kering  Foundation.  The  Foundation has put together an impact-focused strategy, working closely with local partners in six specific countries: China, the United States, France, Italy, Mexico and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn each country, the Foundation supports a limited number of local  organizations  helping  women  who  are  victims  of violence  and  working  on  ways  to  change  behavior  and mindsets  in  order  to  promote  equality  between  men  and women. Support is provided at three levels:\n\n- \u00b7 to specialist associations providing support and accommodation  for  women  who  have  suffered  domestic violence, at a national level;\n- \u00b7 to  pilot  initiatives  run  by  non-profit  organizations  and social enterprises that address otherwise unmet needs and test the impact of new models with a view to rolling them out;\n- \u00b7 to grassroots associations, via funds for women, to increase awareness among young women and to help women who are  the  victims  of  violence  find  work  or  develop  their careers.\n\nThe Foundation also aims to create a working environment in which  women  who  have  suffered  violence  feel  safe,  and  to encourage other companies to make efforts in this area.\n\n## 5.4.1.1 Comprehensive, appropriate support for women who are victims of violence\n\nThe  Kering  Foundation  has  always  worked  with  local  and national  organizations,  helping  them  broaden  and  improve the impact of their actions to support women who are victims of violence.\n\nIn the United States, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, the Foundation continues to work hand in hand with a number of specialist organizations: the National Network  to  End Domestic Violence (NNEDV), the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale Solidarit\u00e9 Femmes (FNSF), Donne in Rete contro la violenza (D.i.Re),  and Women's  Aid.  Support  for  these  associations  comes  in  the form of non-earmarked financing, enabling them to strengthen their means of action efficiently and optimally.\n\nIn  addition,  in  each  of  the  six  countries  it  covers,  the Foundation  backs  pilot  initiatives  such  as La  Maison  des Femmes  de  Saint-Denis in  France,  alongside  other  corporate foundations  such  as  Raja  and  Sanofi  Espoir.  Under  a partnership  with  the  Foundation  dating  back  to  2014, La Maison des Femmes de Saint-Denis opened in 2016. A team of gynecologists,  midwives,  nurses,  psychologists,  sexologists, osteopaths,  police  officers  and  lawyers  offer  comprehensive attention, care, support and guidance addressing the medical,\n\npsychological,  emotional  and  material  needs  of  victims. In  2021,  4,174  women  benefited  from  shelter  and  support, and 15,041 consultations took place.\n\nThis  innovative  model  has  a  proven  track  record  in  terms  of impact  and  value  added.  The  Kering  Foundation  is  taking action,  alongside  the  public  authorities  and  other  relevant partners,  to  roll  out  similar  structures  across  the  whole  of France.\n\nIn  March  2021,  the Maison  des  Femmes  de  Saint-Denis announced  the  creation  of  the  Collective  Re#start,  which brings  together  organizations  that  care  for  and  support women  who  are  victims  of  violence  in  France,  Belgium  and Mexico. The collective's patrons are \u00c9lisabeth Moreno, French Minister  Delegate  for  Gender  Equality,  Diversity  and  Equal Opportunities, and Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer  of  Kering  and  Chairman  of  the  Kering Foundation. An initial  group  of  sponsors  -  Axa,  L'Or\u00e9al,  Raja, Sanofi-Espoir and Superga-Beaut\u00e9 - was set up alongside the Kering  Foundation  to  provide  financial  support  to  new organizations  eligible  for  funding  from  the  French  Health Ministry's general interest mission focusing on violence.\n\nIn  June  2021,  Kering,  via  the  Foundation,  took  part  in  the Generation  Equality  Forum  co-organized  by  UN  Women, Mexico  and  France.  As  a  Champion  of  the  gender-based violence  action  coalition,  and  on  behalf  of  the  One  in  Three Women  network  that  the  Foundation  co-founded  in  2018, Kering was invited to speak at the Forum's opening ceremony in  late  June  2021,  in  the  presence  of  President  Emmanuel Macron.  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  announced  that  the  Group would  provide  total  funding  of  \u20ac5  million  over  five  years  to fund,  alongside  the  French  government,  the  opening  of 15 centers in France modeled on the Maison des Femmes de Saint-Denis.\n\nSince  it  was  set  up,  and  in  line  with  its  support  for  pilot projects,  the  Kering  Foundation  has  been  working  with innovative  social  entrepreneurs  to  combat  violence  against women.\n\nFor example, it has set up the International Social Entrepreneur  Community,  which  aims  to  develop  synergies between these entrepreneurs and encourage the adoption of innovative alternative models in new sectors and countries, in order  to  increase  their  impact.  Members  of  the  Community receive  financial  support  from  the  Kering  Foundation,  follow an  incubation  program  and  take  part  in  annual  workshops. The  Community  currently  has  10  members,  including Colori Vivi, Chayn, Gendes, Las Panas and du Pain & des Roses .\n\nIn Italy, the Kering Foundation partnered the social enterprise Colori  Vivi  -  which  supports  female  refugees  and  provides them with training in its Made in Italy creative workshop - for the  fourth  year  running.  The  women  receive  guidance  from qualified  volunteer  tailors  and  stylists,  who  show  them  the basics  behind  making  quality  clothes  and  accessories.  Colori Vivi has so far provided jobs to four vulnerable women as well as seven on-the-job training courses.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, social enterprise Chayn - a Foundation partner  since  2018  -  supports  women  who  are  victims  of violence by providing easy-to-access interactive online resources  in  several  languages.  In  the  last  eight  years, 500,000  women and users have accessed Chayn's  resources, with 1.5 million page views.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  new  grant will  help  Las  Panas  open  a  social  bakery  to  sell  what  the women make;\n- \u00b7 Du Pain & des Roses (DPDR), which trains vulnerable women in  the  practice  of  floristry  through  professional  courses, helping  them  develop  their  skills  and  create  social connections.  The  Foundation's  new  grant  will  help  DPDR extend its operations to Nantes.\n\nOther pilot projects got underway in 2021 in Italy and the UK. In  November,  the  Foundation  joined  forces  with  La  Casa  di Accoglienza  delle  Donne  Maltrattate  (CADMI)  in  Milan,  to support  its  Work  and  Freedom  project  over  the  next  three years.  When  CADMI  opened  in  1986,  it  was  Italy's  first anti-violence  center.  It  supports  women  who  are  victims  of domestic  violence  through  various  services:  psychological consultations, emergency accommodation, free legal support, and help accessing training and getting jobs. The aim of the project is to help 1,000 women who have suffered violence to return to work and develop their careers, in order to help them recover  more  quickly  and  become  self-sufficient,  both economically and personally.\n\nThe  Foundation  also  started  a  new  partnership  with  the London  Black  Women's  Project  (LBWP)  to  set  up  The  Safe Haven  Project.  This  initiative  aims  firstly  to  understand  and document more effectively the impact of sexual harassment in the workplace on women from ethnic minorities and migrant women, and secondly to give them better support. The project will  share  best  practice  in  this  area,  improve  the  women's access to legal and administrative advice, and ensure that they are closely involved in making use of the services available to them.\n\nThe Kering Foundation also supports grassroots associations, working with funds for women.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Foundation  continued  four  other  partnerships with  such  funds:  Rosa  Fund  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the Mediterranean  Women's  Fund  in  France  and  Italy,  Fondo Semillas in Mexico, and the Women Foundation of California in the United States.\n\nVia the  Women's  Foundation  of  California,  the  Kering Foundation  supports  FreeFrom,  a  non-profit  based  in  Los Angeles that focuses on the financial security and long-term protection  of  victims  of  domestic  violence.  In  the  United States, 99% of domestic violence survivors are also victims of financial  abuse,  which  prevents  them  from  leaving  their partners.\n\nIn particular, thanks  to  the  support  provided  by  the Foundation since 2016, HER Fund in Hong Kong is bolstering the financial resources and capacity of three small grassroots non-profits  led  by  marginalized  women  who  have  suffered violence: two of these organizations work to prevent and raise awareness of cyberbullying among young girls and boys, and the  other,  The  Corner,  focuses  on  the  LGBTQI+  community, working  with  lesbian  women  who  have  suffered  domestic violence. Over the past three years, this organization, founded by  eight  young  Hong  Kong  volunteers,  has  been  running awareness-raising  courses  on  domestic  violence,  and  has been  able  to  establish  a  dialogue  with  local  authorities  and the  police  on  procedures  in  tackling  matters  that  affect  this community in particular.\n\n## 5.4.1.2 Changing behaviors and mindsets by engaging with young people to promote gender equality\n\nAs  well  as  providing  support  for  victims,  it  is  essential  to address  the  origins  of  violence  with  a  view  to  preventing  it occurring  in  the  first  place.  In  2021,  the  Kering  Foundation stepped up its support for young people, and young boys in particular, in order to break the cycle of violence.\n\nIn New York, the Foundation has renewed its commitment for the  next  three  years  to  the  New  York  City  Alliance  Against Sexual  Assault  (NYCAASA)  and  its  Project  Dream-Own-Tell (DOT),  an  innovative  program  that  helps  young  people  from underprivileged  communities  defend  themselves  against sexual  violence.  Project  DOT  offers  these  young  people,  who are often overlooked by traditional sex education campaigns, a  platform  for  creating  and  sharing  positive  messages  with their communities. In the last three years, 373 young people have  taken  part  in  the  program.  In  2021,  its  workshops attracted  64  young  participants  including  young  women  of color,  people  from  the  LGBTQI+  community,  immigrants, people  whose  mothers  have  been  or  are  incarcerated,  and people in difficult socio-economic circumstances.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  between  2018  and  2021,  the  Foundation supported the US non-profit Promundo and its Manhood 2.0 program. The program aims to change mindsets among young men  aged  between  15  and  24,  encouraging  them  to  take  a closer  look  at  the  unequal  value  system  in  which  they  have been raised, at what it really means 'to be a man', and at the consequences  for  their  physical  and  mental  health  and relationships.  Over  the  course  of  the  project,  45  facilitators received training, and the results were positive, since 90% of them said they felt more capable of supporting the young men taking part in the Manhood 2.0 program.\n\nIn 2021, the Kering Foundation and Promundo continued the Global Boyhood Initiative to provide younger boys aged 4-13 (and the adults around them) with educational tools to help them grow up with a view of masculinity that is healthy and respectful  of  gender  equality.  Drawing  input  from  interviews with  boys  and  their  parents,  this  initiative  focuses  on  four fundamental  ways  of  developing  positive  masculinity:  share emotions  in  healthy  ways,  accept  and  connect  with  others, break  free  from  stereotypes,  and  stand  up  and  speak  out against bullying and inequality. After initiating this project in the  United  States  in  2020,  the  Foundation  and  Promundo in 2021 carried out quantitative and qualitative research into the  subject  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  France  among  boys aged  4-13  and  their  parents,  asking  them  about  education, violence,  ethnic  disparities,  youth  justice,  and  attitudes  to gender and sexuality.\n\nGendes is a non-profit in Mexico that runs weekly men's group sessions to encourage a shift in mindsets with regard to the definition of masculinity. Since it was founded, it has helped 700 men to explore how every person is responsible for their actions. Three out of four women whose partners have taken part in Gendes' programs have reported a reduction in violence and  feel  increasingly  safe  in  their  relationships.  Given  the problems raised by the health crisis in 2020, Gendes opened a hotline  to  offer  individual  support  to  men  about  to  commit violence. In 2020, 610 men contacted the hotline, and in 2021, 1,208 men were able to receive telephone-based assistance.",

        "page_content": "In 2021, the Kering Foundation continued its commitment to work on breaking the intergenerational cycle of violence and the  climate  of  silence  that  surrounds  the  subject  of  incest. According  to  the  World  Health  Organization,  20%  of  women and between 5% and 10% of men say that they suffered sexual abuse  during  childhood,  with  incest  cited  in  80%  of  these cases.\n\nTo  help  address  this  unacceptable  situation,  in  2019  the Foundation supported a campaign to support victims of incest by providing consultations at La Maison des Femmes de SaintDenis .  In  2021,  57  women  who  had  suffered  incest  received support, and 229 consultations took place.\n\nThe  Foundation  also  supported  Make.org  and  the Grande Cause pour la Protection de l'Enfance ,  in  partnership  with  the French  Secretary  of  State  for  Children  and  Families,  Adrien Taquet,  in  taking  action  alongside  a  network  of  specialist associations to put an end to this violence. In September 2021, Make.org unveiled an action plan in the presence of Edouard Durand, the judge in charge of France's Committee on Sexual Violence  and  Incest.  The  plan  focuses  on  four  key  areas: awareness-raising  and  prevention;  detection  and  reporting; judicial procedures and punishments; and care.\n\n## 5.4.1.3 Working together for a greater impact\n\nThrough the efforts of its networks and collective action, the Kering Foundation wants to achieve a lasting shift in behavior patterns and greater awareness of violence against women.\n\nIn January  2021,  for  its  internal  purposes,  the  Kering Foundation published a global policy on domestic violence in coordination with the Group's Human Resources Department. The policy guarantees confidential and appropriate support to any person employed by Kering or its brands who has suffered violence.  Support  measures  include  flexible  working  hours, special  leave  and  financial  help,  and  victims  are  also  put  in touch with specialist associations.\n\nKering's  global  policy  on  domestic  violence  forms  part  of  a broader  program  developed  by  the  Foundation  since  2011, intended to create a caring and safe working environment for all victims of violence. The  Kering  Foundation  trains employees from the Group and its Houses on understanding, listening  to  and  helping  victims  of  domestic  violence,  in partnership  with  leading  associations  in  this  area:  the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale Solidarit\u00e9 Femmes (FNSF, France), Donne in  Rete  contro  la  violenza (D.i.Re,  Italy),  Women's  Aid  (United Kingdom) and the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV,  United  States).  A  total  of  1,685  employees  have received this training, including all members of the Executive Committee.  Since  2021,  all  Group  staff  members  have  been able to access a 30-minute e-learning session made available by the Foundation, available in English, French and Italian.\n\nExternally, the Foundation strives to encourage others to join this  fight.  In  2018,  the  Kering  Foundation  and  FACE  jointly founded One In Three Women, the first European network of companies committed to combating violence against women. The  network  currently  has  10  members  alongside  FACE  and the Kering Foundation: L'Or\u00e9al, Korian, BNP Paribas, Carrefour,\n\nle Fonds de solidarit\u00e9 OuiCare ,  SNCF, Publicis, PwC, Epnak and Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement (AFD).  In  2021,  to  mark International  Day  for  the  Elimination  of  Violence  against Women, the One In Three Women network released its second podcast,  highlighting  the  key  role  that  business  can  play  in combating  domestic  violence.  To  date,  the  podcast  has  had more than 1,200 plays.\n\nThe Foundation also supported the \" H24, 24H dans la vie d'une femme \"  series  broadcast  on  European  cultural  TV  network Arte. H24 highlights  the  various  forms  of  abuse  that  women can suffer at any time of the day or night, through a collection of  24  shorts  inspired  by  real-life  events  and  starring  24 internationally  renowned  female  actors.  The  Foundation's support  included  compiling  a  list  of  associations  that  help survivors,  which  is  available  on  the  websites  of  Arte  and  the Foundation  itself.  Also  in  connection  with  International  Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women,  the Foundation organized two Instagram Live events featuring the women  who  directed H24 and  the  women  taking  action against  this  everyday  abuse  via  the  Kering  Foundation's partner  associations En  Avant  Toute(s) and  the Maison  des Femmes de Saint-Denis.\n\nTo  shed  light  on  the  stories  of  women  who  have  survived abuse, and the professionals who help them, a series of videos entitled \"Kering Foundation's portraits\" was launched in 2021. Nine  episodes  are  available  on  the  Kering  Foundation's website and on the Group's YouTube channel.\n\nThe  Kering  Foundation  encourages  Group  employees  to  use their  professional  and  personal  skills  to  support  partner associations  and  social  enterprises.  The  COVID-19  pandemic meant  that  the  Foundation's  International  Volunteering Program  was  put  on  hold  in  2020  and  2021.  However,  at  a more  local level, Kering started offering volunteering opportunities on the new Giving Back platform launched by its HR  department  in  2021.  Staff  members  in  France,  Italy  and the United Kingdom can spend one hour per week, a half-day every three months or a full day every six months helping local associations, depending on their needs.\n\n## 5.4.2 Philanthropic actions by Kering's Houses\n\nAlongside the initiatives undertaken by the Kering Foundation, each  House  supports  causes  of  its  own  choice  by  donating products, running special sales, taking part in charity dinners, seconding personnel, or forming partnerships with non-profit organizations.  In  2021,  support  from  Kering's  Houses  for various  causes  such  as  integration  and  the  fight  against discrimination, healthcare and  disease  prevention,  and environmental  protection  -  for  which  the  House's  initiatives are  detailed  below  -  totaled  more  than  \u20ac8,330,000.  There were also many other initiatives in the fields of education and the preservation of cultural, artistic and historical heritage.\n\nSeveral  of  these  -  in  fields  such  as  healthcare  and  the environment  -  are  specifically  for  the  benefit  of  women, consistent with the Group's priorities, and children. In 2021, of the  aforementioned  support  figure  of  \u20ac8,330,000,  they accounted for more than \u20ac2,170,000.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The project is managed by the women's  rights  organization Unione  Donne  Italiane (UDI)  in Pescara.  It  supports  employees  with  a  specific  focus  on women,  and  provides  them  with  the  tools  they  need  to manage and defuse conflicts and stressful situations. In 2020, assistance  was  extended  to  cover  all  production  sites, including Curno, in addition to Penne, Civitella and Montebello, and this arrangement was maintained in 2021.\n\nAgain  in  Italy,  the  Houses  maintained  their  commitment  to associations  focusing  on  combating  domestic  violence. Examples are Pomellato, which continued to support the Casa di  Accoglienza  delle  Donne  Maltrattate  di  Milano (CADMI)  in Milan,  and  Kering  Eyewear,  which  made  a  donation  to  the Centro  Veneto  Progetti  Donna in  the  Veneto  region.  Both  of these  associations  are  members  of  D.i.Re,  the  nationwide network  of  organizations  offering  psychological,  emotional and legal assistance to women who have suffered violence.\n\nThe  Houses  also  showed  their  commitment  by  donating products and taking part in fundraising events. For example, Bottega  Veneta,  Boucheron  and  Saint  Laurent  supported  Un Avenir  pour  les  Enfants  du  Monde (AEM)  and  its  \"dinner  in Rwanda\" event, raising \u20ac28,900.\n\nBoucheron gave \u20ac49,000 of support to the Partage association and its Cantines  du  Monde project,  funding  a  school  canteen for  around  1,100  children  at  the \u00c9cole  des  Salines in Madagascar for one year.\n\nSaint  Laurent  donated  10%  of  the  proceeds  from  a  special sales event to Solidarit\u00e9 Femmes (FNSF) and SOS Femmes 49, associations that specialize in providing help and accommodation to women who are victims of violence, raising a total of \u20ac160,000.\n\nSaint Laurent also renewed its support for the Charity: water non-profit, which works with local associations worldwide to bring safe supplies of drinking water to people who lack it. In particular,  this  project  gives  greater  freedom  to  the  women and girls who are usually responsible for collecting water every day,  giving  them  more  time  to  pursue  their  education  and work.  Over  the  last  four  years,  projects  financed  by  Saint Laurent  in  Ethiopia,  Rwanda,  Malawi  and  India  have  brought drinking water to more than 8,000 people.\n\nIn England, Alexander McQueen donated more than \u20ac150,000 to  A  Team  Arts  Education,  a  community  arts  education organization that works with young people, encouraging their aspirations to pursue arts and design careers.\n\nWith  its  Chime  for  Change  campaign,  Gucci  continued supporting organizations such as UNHCR, Women for Afghan Women,  BEAWARENOW,  Promundo  and  D.i.Re,  with  total funding of \u20ac820,000. These associations work to ensure that the  safety,  health  and  rights  of  women  are  respected  regardless of whether they are transgender, indigenous or of color,  or  whether  they  belong  to  ethnic  minorities  or  have disabilities  -  all  around  the  world.  Among  its  partnerships, Gucci  increased  its  commitment  to  Mothers  to  Mothers  by donating \u20ac175,000 to support health services for women and children in Ghana, and particularly to give HIV-positive women the  knowledge  and  tools  needed  to  eliminate  mother-child transmission of HIV.\n\n## Promoting integration and combating discrimination\n\nIn  2021,  Kering  spent  around  \u20ac2,150,000  on  initiatives  to promote integration and combat discrimination.\n\nBalenciaga made a commitment to Share Africa - a non-profit that  is  a  forum  for  young  people,  creativity,  innovation  and resilience  -  to  have  Executive  Committee  members  mentor five  creative  young  Africans,  as  well  as  providing  financial support of \u20ac50,000.\n\nBrioni  supported Colori  Vivi  Sartoria ,  a  creative  workshop  in which  female  refugees  learn  the  principles  of  garment production,  allowing  them  to  gain  qualifications  but  also obtain a stable income and become financially independent. It did  so  by  donating  material  and  establishing  an  ongoing collaboration  around  the  launch  of  the  Intensee  fragrance. Gucci  was  also  involved  in  several  initiatives  to  promote integration and combat discrimination. Through its \"Gucci-up\" circular  economy  program,  the  House  continued  to  help deprived  women  by  donating  over  \u20ac80,000  of  fabric  to  NGO and social cooperatives in Italy such as Progetto Quid, Colori Vivi  Sartoria  and  WeWorld.  These  associations,  which  recycle and upcycle donated fabrics, work with marginalized groups, and particularly women, by offering them training programs to help them reintegrate return to the workforce.\n\nPomellato  supported  the  San  Patrignano  Onlus  non-profit, which  works  with  dependent,  marginalized  groups,  with  a donation of \u20ac10,000.\n\nStill  in  Italy,  Bottega  Veneta  provided  support  to  the  Adecco Foundation in 2021 by employing refugees in its production facilities in the Veneto region. Two people have been hired so far,  one  on  a  permanent  contract  and  the  other  on  an internship.\n\nIn  the  United Kingdom, Bottega Veneta made a commitment to  the  Metallic  Fund,  a  non-profit  that  provides  grants  and mentoring,  aiming  to  elevate  talents  and  ideas,  addressing inequality in the creative industries and inspiring others to rise.",

Ulysse  Nardin  donated  almost \u20ac10,000  to  healthcare  and  disease-prevention  projects, supporting non-profits such as Les Petits Doudous , Cansearch, Association  Intervall  and  Leman  Hope.  Boucheron  donated almost  \u20ac20,000  to  associations  like Stars  Solidaires ,  to  help fund research into rare genetic neuromuscular diseases, and Rotary Club to support the Hopital Lariboisi\u00e8re in France. Saint Laurent,  meanwhile,  donated  more  than  \u20ac36,000  to  Fashion for Sidaction, amfAR and AIDES. Alexander McQueen also gave \u20ac45,000  to  amfAR  to  help  fund  medical  research  into  AIDS. Balenciaga made commitments to several non-profits aiming to raise awareness of and fund research into breast cancer, such as Korea Breast Cancer Fund and Hudson Valley Making Strides.\n\nBottega  Veneta  continued  to  support  scientific  research  in Italy, making grants for researchers at the University of Padua, along  with  grants  for  the  virology  laboratory  at  the  Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome and the microbiology and virology laboratory at the Domenico Cotugno  Hospital  in  Naples.  Its  second  round  of  grants amounted to  \u20ac150,000  in  2021,  making  a  total  of  \u20ac300,000 over two years.\n\nGucci  made  significant  contributions  to  various  healthcare and  disease  prevention  initiatives  by  supporting  non-profits such  as  Susan  G.  Komen  in  the  United  States,  the  AIRC Foundation for Cancer Research and the European Institute of Oncology  in  Italy,  Great  Ormond  Street  Hospital  and  the National  AIDS  Trust  in  the  United  Kingdom.  Gucci  also continued working with UNICEF to support the fair distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn  2021  and  in  line  with  the  Group's  strategy,  the  various Houses  contributed  around  \u20ac660,000  to  sustainability  and environment initiatives.\n\nBalenciaga  continued  its  reforestation  project  in  the  Gujarat province  of  India, in partnership  with  NGO  Up2Green Reforestation,  providing  more  than  \u20ac35,000  of  financial support.  The  project  aims  to  improve  community  resilience, with a particular focus on women.\n\nIn  China,  Qeelin  continued  its  support  for  the  World  Wildlife Fund (WWF) with donations of more than \u20ac60,000 to restore and  protect  ravaged  bamboo  forests,  which  constitute  the natural habitat of pandas.\n\nGucci  continued  its  three-year  partnership  with  the  Lion's Share,  a  United  Nations  Development  Programme  MultiPartner Trust Fund launched in 2020 whose aims are wildlife conservation  and  animal  welfare.  Gucci  donated  more  than \u20ac127,000 to this fund in 2021.\n\nBoucheron,  meanwhile,  provided  more  than  \u20ac24,000  of support  to  environmental  protection  initiatives,  donating products to Birdlife International Tokyo and money to C\u0153ur de For\u00eat in Madagascar, which is fighting deforestation alongside local communities.\n\nFinally, Ulysse Nardin  made  a  commitment  to  ocean conservation by supporting Water Family and The Ocean Race Summits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\n## To the Shareholders' Meeting,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Kering SA (hereinafter the 'Company'), appointed as independent third party ('third party') and  accredited  by  the  French  Accreditation  Committee  (Cofrac),  under  number  3-1048  (Cofrac  Inspection  Accreditation, no. 3-1048, scope available at www.cofrac.fr) and currently adapting our management system as required by the Cofrac for this accreditation (from ISO17020 to ISO 17029), we have conducted procedures to express a limited assurance conclusion on the historical  information  (observed  or  extrapolated)  in  the  consolidated  non-financial  performance  statement,  prepared  in accordance with the Company's procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), for the year ended December 31, 2021 (hereinafter the 'Information' and the 'Statement', respectively), presented in the Group management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225-102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) .\n\nIt is also our responsibility to express, at the request of the Company and outside the scope of our accreditation, a reasonable assurance conclusion on the fact that some information selected by the Company and presented in the Statement has been prepared,  in  all  material  aspects,  fairly  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines.  These  information  are  the  following:  energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions, Renewable electricity proportion at Group level, Emissions associated with 'B to B' transport, tons of CO2 offset.\n\n## Conclusion of limited assurance on the consolidated non-financial performance statement in accordance with Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (ode de commerce)\n\nBased on our procedures as described in the section 'Nature and scope of procedures' and the evidence we have obtained, no material misstatements have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the non-financial performance statement does not  comply  with  the  applicable  regulatory  provisions  and  that  the  Information,  taken  as  a  whole,  is  not  fairly  presented  in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Conclusion of reasonable assurance on selected information included in the Statement\n\nIn our opinion, the information selected by the Company has been prepared fairly, in all material aspects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Preparation of the consolidated non-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used reference framework or established practices on which to base the assessment and measurement of the Information enables the use of different but acceptable measurement techniques that may impact comparability between entities and over time.\n\nAccordingly, the Information must be read and interpreted with reference to the Guidelines, summarised in the Statement and available on the Company's website.\n\n## Limits inherent in the preparation of the information relating to the Statement\n\nThe Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Executive Management,\n\nPursuant to your request and in our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Kering SA (hereinafter the 'Company'), we performed a review with the aim of providing limited assurance on information concerning the Environmental Profit & Loss Account ('EP&L') selected by the Company (hereinafter 'the Information (1) ') prepared in conformity with procedures used by the Company (hereinafter the 'Guidelines') and presented within section 3.2.2.2 of the Universal Reference Document  for financial year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased  on  the  procedures  we  have  performed  as  described  under  the  paragraph  'Nature  and  scope  of  procedures',  and  the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Preparation of the Information\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used reference framework or established practices on which to base the assessment and measurement of the Information enables the use of different but acceptable measurement techniques that may impact comparability between entities and over time.\n\nAccordingly,  the  Information  must  be  read  and  interpreted  with  reference  to  the  Guidelines,  summarised  in  the  Universal Reference Document and available on the Company's website or on request from its headquarters.\n\n## Limits inherent in the preparation of the Information\n\nThe Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external  data  used,  notably  regarding  environmental  impact  factors  ('multipliers')  and  monetisation  factors  used.  Some information is sensitive to the choices of methodologies and the assumptions and/or estimates used for its preparation.\n\n## Responsibility of the Company\n\nThe Company is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 Selecting or establishing suitable criteria and procedures for preparing the Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 Preparing the Information in accordance with the Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 Implementing internal control relevant to the preparation of the Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor\n\nThe conclusion presented in this assurance report only covers the Information and does not extend to other information and data concerning the environmental profit & loss account (EP&L) included in the Universal Reference Document.\n\n- (1) Total amount for environmental impact estimated in \u20ac for 2021, Intensity (\u20acEP&L/1,000\u20ac of revenue) for 2021, % change in total amount and intensity in relation to 2020 (comparable scope), Mapping of 2021 impacts per environmental impact (6 impacts for Tiers 0 to 4 and for the use and end of life phases), Distribution of impacts per raw material (Tiers 3 & 4) for 2021.",

In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, professional ethical requirements, and French professional standards applicable for this assignment.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe planned and performed our work in order to express a reasonable assurance regarding the following Information:\n\n- \u00b7 Total amount for environmental impact estimated in \u20ac for 2021;\n- \u00b7 Intensity (\u20acEP&L/1,000\u20ac of revenue) for 2021;\n- \u00b7 % change in total amount and intensity in relation to 2020 (comparable scope);\n- \u00b7 Mapping of 2021 impacts per environmental impact (6 impacts for Tiers 0 to 4 and for the use and end of life phases);\n- \u00b7 Distribution of impacts per raw material (Tiers 3 & 4) for 2021.\n\nThe nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on professional judgment, including the assessment of risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in the Information. We took into account relevant internal controls for the preparation of the Information by the Company during our risk assessment.\n\n## We also:\n\n- \u00b7 assessed  the  suitability  of  the  Guidelines  with  respect  to  their  relevance,  completeness,  reliability,  neutrality  and understandability;\n- \u00b7 verified the set-up of a process to collect, compile, process, and check the completeness and consistency of the Information;\n- \u00b7 interviewed the relevant staff from the Company's Departments at its headquarters and for a selection of contributing entities in order to analyse the deployment and application of the Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 performed analytical procedures on the Information and verified, the calculations as well as the consolidation of the data and the consistency of its evolution;\n- \u00b7 carried out substantive tests using sampling techniques, for a representative selection of entities that we selected (1) to verify the correct application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile data with supporting evidence.\n\nWe consider that the sampling techniques and sample sizes we have used in exercising our professional judgement enable us to express  our  conclusion.  The  procedures  conducted  in  a  limited  assurance  review  are  substantially  less  in  scope  than  those required to issue a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes) ; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, March 4, 2022 One of the Statutory Auditors,\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also takes account of the requirements set out in Article 173 of French law no. 2015-992 of August 17, 2015 on energy transition for sustainable development.\n\nThe AMF's framework is based not only on the aforementioned French and EU legislation and regulations, but also on internal control and risk management best practices and international standards,  in  particular  ISO  31000  and  COSO ( Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations ) , which were analyzed in depth when the risk management policy was drafted. This policy is set out in the section entitled 'Components of risk management'.\n\nIn accordance  with  ordinance  order  no.  2017-1180  of July 19, 2017 on non-financial reporting and its implementing decree  no.  2017-1265  of  August  9,  2017,  the  Kering  group presents  the  Non-Financial  Information  Statement  (NFIS) for 2021 in Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document. The following sections include references to the NFIS.\n\n## 1.1 Scope and principles of organization\n\nKering  is  the  parent  company  of  the  Kering  group,  whose entities  operate  in  the  luxury  industry.  The  following  report aims to describe the internal control procedures in the Group and  especially  those  procedures  relating  to  the  preparation and processing  of  financial  and  accounting  information.  The scope  of  the  Group  covered  by  the  report  includes  all  fully consolidated subsidiaries, i.e., the companies over which the Group directly or indirectly exercises exclusive control.\n\nAs  a  holding  company,  Kering's  own  operations  consist  of (i)  defining  and  implementing its strategy, (ii) organizing and managing its holdings, (iii) stimulating the development of its activities  and  coordinating  their  financing,  (iv)  providing support  and  communication  functions,  and  (v)  defining  and implementing the insurance coverage policy.\n\nThe internal control function follows the general organization of the Group. It is both:\n\n- \u00b7 decentralized  at  the  level  of  the  activities:  Executive Management of the operating and legal entities is responsible for managing and coordinating the internal control process;\n- \u00b7 unified around a common methodology and a single set of standards.  The  Kering  holding  company  coordinates  its deployment across the Group, supported by teams at Kering Asia-Pacific and Kering Americas.\n\n## 1.2 General principles of risk management\n\nAccording to the AMF definition, risks represent the possibility that an event may occur and could have an impact on people, assets,  the  environment,  the  Company's  objectives  and  its reputation.\n\nRisk management covers areas that are much wider than just financial risks: for example, operational, labor-related, environmental and compliance risk. Risk management is a key management tool that helps to:\n\n- \u00b7 create and preserve the value, assets and reputation of the Company;\n\n- \u00b7 tighten  up  the  security  of  the  Company's  decision-making and  other  processes  to  support  the  achievement  of  its objectives;\n- \u00b7 mitigate  the  risk  of  unexpected  outcomes  and  operating losses;\n- \u00b7 ensure  that  initiatives  are  consistent  with  the  Company's values;\n- \u00b7 bring  Company  employees  together  to  develop  a  shared view of the main risks.",

In 2021, the Group pressed ahead with the changes to its risk management methodology initiated in 2011 and to the resources used  for its risk management  system. The Group's system provides for an organizational framework, a three-step  risk  management  process  and  continuous monitoring.\n\n## 1.3.1 Organizational framework\n\nThis organizational framework includes:\n\n- \u00b7 an organization that sets out the roles and responsibilities of the various persons involved and lays down procedures, as well as consistent and clear standards, for the system;\n- \u00b7 a  risk  management  policy  that  sets  out  the  objectives  of the system in line with the Company's culture, the shared language used, and the process to identify, analyze and deal with risks;\n- \u00b7 an  IT  system  that  makes  it  possible  to  enter  information about risks;\n- \u00b7 planned  reporting  of  risk  information  to  stakeholders identified within the Group, as well as an annual presentation to the Board of Directors.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nWithin the scope of the Group's risk management policy and in accordance  with  Kering's  corporate  governance,  Kering's Executive Management created a 'Kering group Risk Committee' in  2011. It  comprises the Group Managing Director, the Chief Financial  Officer,  the  General  Counsel,  the  Chief  Audit Executive,  the  Head  of  the  Security  Department,  the  Chief Information  Security  Officer  and  the  Risk  Manager.  As  the Group's  operations  and  activities  expand,  and  become  more complex  and  more  international,  the  Risk  Committee  helps identify and rank the main risks that could have an impact on the Group's business operations. Internal rules determine how the Committee is managed, and how it operates.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews (i) the validation and monitoring process  for  the  Group's  risk  management  policy;  (ii)  the monitoring  of  the  latest  developments  and  relevance  of analysis relating to operational, labor-related, environmental, financial and compliance risks; (iii) the analysis summaries of general and specific risks; and (iv) the validation and monitoring of  action  plans  rolled  out  with  the  aim  of  controlling identified risks.\n\nThe Risk Committee's work is brought to the attention of the Audit  Committee,  which  is  informed  of  the  Committee's internal rules and has access to the minutes of its meetings.\n\n## Risk Manager\n\nThe Risk Manager function was created within the Company to coordinate this more robust risk management system, ensure that the  Executive  Management  teams  of  the  Group's activities  analyze  the  main  risks  within  their  scope  of business,  and  provide  the  members  of  the  Risk  Committee, prior  to  each  meeting,  with  the  information  and  documents necessary for their work and their discussions.\n\n## Risk management policy\n\nAfter  reviewing  the  COSO  internal  control  frameworks  in particular, the Group implemented a risk management policy that  was  sent  to  the  Executive  Management  teams  of  the activities  and  Houses. This document describes the methods used by the Group for its risk analysis work.\n\n## 1.3.2 A three-step risk management process involving:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying risks: in this step, the main risks are identified and centralized. A risk is characterized by an event, one or more  internal  or  external  sources,  and  one  or  more consequences. Within the Group, the identification of risks is  part  of  an  ongoing  process  that  takes  the  Houses' perspective  into  account,  as  well  as  the  Group's  broader vision. During  this  stage, interviews with the main stakeholders  (the  recommended  and  most  widely  used technique)  are  conducted  to  identify  the  risks  liable  to affect  the  Group's  ability  to  achieve  its  objectives.  Kering relies  on  the  prior  year's  risk  registers,  as  well  as  various sources, both external (e.g., surveys) and internal (e.g., reporting of information);\n- \u00b7 assessing risks : this step involves evaluating the main risks identified  on  the  basis  of  three  criteria:  their  impact, their  probability  of  occurrence  and  their  level  of  control. This  is  also  a  continuous  effort,  and  assessments  are conducted  once  a  year  during  work  sessions  with  key managers  from  the  Houses,  Kering's  divisions  in  the Americas  and  Asia-Pacific,  and  the  Group.  The  risk management  policy  describes  in  detail  the  criteria  and procedures for these assessments;\n- \u00b7 prioritizing risks: during this last step, risks are ranked by priority  and  the  most  appropriate  action  plan(s)  for  the Company is(are) identified.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  addition,  risk  information  is  also  shared  with  each  of  the  Houses  during  feedback meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.3.3 Oversight of the risk management system\n\nThe risk management system is monitored and reviewed on a regular  basis  to  help  continuously  improve  the  system.  The objective is to identify and analyze the main risks and to learn from risks that have materialized.\n\nThe Risk Committee meets in principle at least twice a year to review  the  risk  maps  drawn  up  by  the  Group  Internal  Audit Department, and to monitor the progress of the specific action plans.\n\nThe Risk  Committee met three times in 2021, and the Audit Committee and Board of Directors were apprised of its work at their meetings held in June and October 2021, respectively.\n\n## 1.4 Link between risk management and internal control\n\nThe  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are complementary, and together help control the Group's activities:\n\n- \u00b7 the  risk  management  system  is  designed  to  identify  and analyze the main risks. Risks are dealt with and addressed in  action  plans  that  can  be  adapted  to  the  organization, may  include  project  management,  and  may  also  involve implementing controls. The controls to be implemented are part  of  the  internal  control  system  and  may  be  reviewed based on the risk maps;\n\n- \u00b7 the  internal  control  system  uses  the  risk  management system to identify the main risks to be controlled;\n- \u00b7 the  audit  plan  uses  the  risk  map  to  test  the  assessment of the level of control of the risks identified.\n\nThe interaction between and the combined balance of the two systems depend on the control environment, which provides a  common  underpinning,  particularly  the  risk  and  control culture of the Company and the ethical values of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## 1.5 General principles of internal control\n\n## 1.5.1 Definition of internal control\n\nThe  internal  control  procedures  applicable  within  the  Kering group rely on a set of resources, policies, conduct, procedures and  appropriate  actions  to  ensure  that  the  necessary measures are taken in order to control:\n\n- \u00b7 activities, operational effectiveness and the efficient use of resources;\n- \u00b7 operational, labor-related, environmental,  financial or compliance  risks  that  could  have  a  significant  impact  on the Company's assets or the achievement of its objectives.\n\nInternal  control  is  defined  as  a  process  conducted  by Executive Management, under the supervision of the Board of Directors,  and  implemented  by  senior  executives  and  all employees.  Regardless  of  its  quality  and  its  degree  of application,  it  cannot  provide  absolute  assurance  that  the goals falling within the following categories will be met:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations in force;\n- \u00b7 application  of  guidelines  and  directions  set  by  Executive Management;\n- \u00b7 smooth operation of internal processes, particularly those contributing to the safeguarding of assets;\n- \u00b7 reliability of financial and accounting information.\n\n## 1.6 Components of internal control\n\nThe  quality  of  the  internal  control  system  is  based  on  the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 the  control  environment  based  on  rules  of  conduct  and integrity supported by management and communicated to all employees;\n- \u00b7 an organization that clearly defines responsibilities and has adequate resources and skills;\n- \u00b7 a system to identify, analyze and manage the main risks;\n- \u00b7 ongoing oversight of the internal control system and regular review of the functioning of the system.\n\n## 1.6.1 Internal control environment\n\nThe Group's internal control system is based on a decentralized organization that clearly defines responsibilities through  the  Group  Charter.  It  includes  principles  and  values governing  the  conduct  and  ethics  of  all  its  employees, presented  in  the  Code  of  Ethics.  It  also  includes  an  Internal Control  Charter.  Moreover,  it  relies  on  human  resources management  that  ensures  the  competency,  ethical  conduct and involvement of its employees.\n\n## The Group Charter\n\nThe Kering group adopted a Charter several years ago, which was  updated  in  2012  and  provides  the  framework  for  the decentralization of the organization and the responsibility of senior  executives.  The  Charter  defines  the  guiding  principles governing  the  relations  between  Kering  and  its  activities.  It also defines, within each functional area: (i) the matters that fall within  the  delegated  responsibility  of  the  activities; (ii) those  that  must  be  communicated  to  Kering  within appropriate time frames; and (iii) those requiring Kering's prior authorization.\n\n## Group principles and values\n\nThe  ethical  principles  of  the  Kering  group  are  set  out  in  the Code of Ethics, first circulated in 2005 and then again in 2009, 2013  and  2019,  following  its  update  in  2018.  It  is  now available to all Group employees in 14 languages.\n\nThe latest update focused chiefly on strengthening commitments regarding  personnel  and  the  behavior  expected  of  everyone, and on Group measures and policies brought in following the introduction  of  new  legislation  and  regulations,  such  as France's Sapin II law. The update was also an opportunity to strengthen  the  Suppliers'  Charter  included  in  the  Code  of Ethics, with regard to human rights in particular. In addition, the  Code  of  Ethics  now  extends  to  the  commitments  of members of the Executive Committee as well as the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and,  for  the  first  time,  was presented to and reviewed by the Kering Board of Directors.\n\n## 1.5.2 Limitations of internal control\n\nThe probability of meeting these objectives is subject to the limitations inherent in any internal control system, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 human  errors  or  malfunctions  occurring  when  decisions are made or applied;\n- \u00b7 deliberate  collusion  among  multiple  individuals,  enabling them to elude the control system;\n- \u00b7 situations in which implementing or maintaining a control would be more expensive than the risk that it is intended to remedy.\n\nFurthermore, in pursuing the objectives indicated above, it is understood  that  companies  are  faced  with  events  and uncertainties beyond their control (unexpected changes in the markets, competitive environment or geopolitical situation, or error  in  forecasting  or  assessing  the  effects  of  such  changes on the organization, etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  presents  the  Group's  ethics  organization  (regional Ethics  Committees,  the  Group  Ethics  Committee,  the  ethics hotline  and  the  steps  to  take  in  cases  of  suspected non-compliance  with  Kering's  ethics  commitments)  and contains  the  Group's  commitments  and  rules  of  conduct towards its main stakeholders:\n\n- \u00b7 employees;\n- \u00b7 customers and consumers;\n- \u00b7 shareholders and financial markets;\n- \u00b7 business partners and competitors;\n- \u00b7 the environment;\n- \u00b7 civil society.\n\nAs part of its revitalized commitment to the promotion of and respect for ethics within the Group, an annual online training program in ethics and Code compliance was rolled out for all Kering  employees  worldwide  in  2014.  It  is  based  on  case studies that show ethics in the light of daily professional life and is updated annually.\n\nThe  Ethics  Committees  are  composed  of  representatives  of the  Group's  Houses  and  Kering  staff.  This  entire  structure  is managed  by  Kering's  Chief  Sustainability  and  Institutional Affairs Officer.\n\nThe Ethics Committees have three main functions:\n\n- \u00b7 supervising  the  circulation  and  application  of  the  Code  of Ethics and the principles that it establishes;\n- \u00b7 responding to any issues raised by a Group employee, be it a  simple  request  for  clarification  or  a  question  relating  to the  interpretation  of  the  Code  and  its  application,  or  a complaint  submitted  to  the  Committee  due  to  alleged non-compliance with one of the Group's ethical principles, a procedure  now  open  to  third  parties  in  certain circumstances;\n- \u00b7 generating initiatives for developing the Group's sustainability and ethics policy and activities.\n\nThe changes made to the Code and the organization of ethics within the Group are examined in detail in section 2 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business' of Chapter 4 'Sustainability' of this Document.\n\n## The Internal Control Charter\n\nThe Kering group adopted an Internal Control Charter in 2010. In  order  to  adapt  the  Charter  to  changes  within  the  Group since  its  initial  publication,  a  new  edition  was  published  in 2015.  The  Charter  defines  internal  control  and  sets  out  its objectives  as  presented  in  the  AMF's  reference  framework.  It also specifies the limitations of internal control, which cannot under any circumstances provide absolute assurance that the Company's  objectives  will  be  achieved.  The  Charter  specifies that the  holding  company  acts  as  the  fulcrum  point coordinating  the  various  entities.  It  also  sets  out  the responsibilities  of  each  of  the  activities  and  Houses  in implementing  an  internal  control  system  that  fits  their operations.\n\nThe  Charter  defines  the  role  of  each  person  involved  in  the internal  control  system  and  the  bodies  responsible  for oversight and assessment.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Charter  specifies  the  existing  tools  for assessing  internal  control  and  risks,  namely  self-assessment of  internal  control  and  mapping  of  major  risks,  and  sets  out the basic principles for creating new procedures.\n\n## Human resources policy\n\nThe quality of Human resources and management cohesiveness are key success factors for the Group.\n\nKering  makes  sure  that  the  various  Houses  apply  human resources policies aligned with their situation and challenges, and meeting the highest local standards.\n\nThe  Houses  lead  and  engage  in  dialogue  and  employee involvement  at  local  level  concerning  labor  policy,  while  the Group  manages  dialogue  within  the  Group's  employee representative  bodies  namely  the  Group  Works  Council  and the European Works Council.\n\nThe Group also supports the Houses with spotting talent for key positions and succession planning, while keeping a close eye on the market to enrich the pool of internal applicants.\n\nKering  supports  the  Houses  by  handling  transactional  HR activities  (payroll,  absence  management,  employee  benefit management) and provides a shared framework for developing  Group-wide  projects:  digital  platforms,  HRIS  and internal  social  media  network,  talent  and  performance management, internal communication for key issues linked to Kering's  values,  global  remuneration  and  employee  benefits policies,  etc.  This  framework  is  constantly  evolving  so  the Houses can meet the new challenges they are faced with.\n\n## 1.6.2 Organization and resources\n\nThe  organization  of  internal  control  depends  on  persons involved  at  every  level  in  the  chain  of  responsibility,  from Executive Management to all employees, as well as the bodies responsible  for  oversight  and  assessment:  the  Board  of Directors,  the  Audit  Committee,  the  Internal  Audit  and  Risk Management Department, and the Statutory Auditors.\n\n## Executive Committee\n\nThe Kering group Executive Committee, which is an Executive Management  body,  comprises  12  members,  as  described  in section 3 of Chapter 1 of this Document.\n\nThe Executive Committee meets regularly in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 draw up and coordinate the Group's operating strategy;\n- \u00b7 define  the  priorities  through  objectives  assigned  to  the activities and the main functional projects;\n- \u00b7 develop synergies between the Houses;\n- \u00b7 propose  acquisitions  and  disposals  to  the  Board  of Directors;\n- \u00b7 ensure proper implementation of the policies and projects defined within the framework of the Group's commitments to sustainability.\n\nKering group strategies and goals are discussed each year via the medium-term plans and the budgets of the business units of each of its activities.",

The  Executive  Management  teams'  involvement  is of  key  importance  to  the  internal  control  system,  given  the Kering group's organization.\n\n## Management and employees\n\nManagement  plays  a  leading  operational  role  in  internal control; it relies on internal control to perform its duties and reach its objectives. In this respect, management implements the  internal  control  operations  related  to  its  area  of responsibility and ensures that the internal control system fits its activities.\n\nEmployees  must  have  the  knowledge  and  information necessary to set up, operate and oversee the internal control system in order to meet the objectives assigned to them. In their day-to-day activities, they follow the principles and rules of  control  and  can  suggest  ways  to  improve  and  detect malfunctions.\n\nThe bodies responsible for oversight and assessment are:\n\n## The Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  contributes  to  the  overall  control environment  through  its  members'  skills  and  expertise.  The Board is regularly informed about the methodologies used for internal control and the management of major risks, which it presents in its Board report.\n\nThe duties of the Board of Directors are presented in section 2.2.1 of Chapter 3 of this Document.\n\n## The Audit Committee\n\nUnder the responsibility of the Board of Directors, to which it regularly reports on these matters, the Kering Audit Committee  comprises  six  members,  four  of  whom  are independent. It is in charge of monitoring:\n\n- \u00b7 the procedures for preparing financial information;\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems;\n- \u00b7 the statutory audits of annual financial statements and, if need  be,  consolidated  financial  statements  performed  by the Statutory Auditors;\n- \u00b7 the independence of the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Kering Audit Committee also:\n\n- \u00b7 verifies  that  the  Group  has  an  Internal  Audit  Department that is structured and well-suited to the tasks of identifying, detecting  and  preventing  risks,  anomalies  or  irregularities in the management of the Group's affairs;\n- \u00b7 assesses  the  relevance  and  quality  of  the  methods  and procedures used;\n- \u00b7 reviews the Internal Audit reports and the recommendations issued;\n- \u00b7 approves the annual Internal Audit plan;\n- \u00b7 reviews the work conducted by the Risk Committee and has access to the minutes of its meetings.\n\nKering's  Audit  Committee  meets  at  least  four  times  a  year. A  growing  number  of  issues  have  to  be  brought  to  its attention.  Accordingly,  the  Audit  Committee  met  five  times during the year to discuss all of the matters in depth.\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  its  duties  are presented in section 2.3.3 of Chapter 3 of this Document.\n\n## The Internal Audit and Risk Management Department\n\nKering group's Internal Audit Department ensures full coverage of the Group.\n\nThrough its work, the Internal Audit Department helps assess the internal control system and recommends improvements.\n\nIt  is  also  in  charge  of  coordinating  risk  management,  in particular  through  risk  mapping  and  action  plan  monitoring. The Chief Audit Executive informs Executive Management and reports  the  main  results  of  his  assessments  to  the  Audit Committee.\n\nIt  coordinates,  harmonizes  and  optimizes  working  methods and tools, as well as providing services (regulatory intelligence, expertise,  resources,  etc.)  and  conducting  audit  assignments within the scope of the annual audit plan.\n\nThe  Group  Internal  Audit  Department  centrally  administers and  analyzes  internal  control  and  risk  management  in accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  applicable  in  this area, as described above.\n\nThe Internal Audit Department also performs active intelligence  monitoring  with  regard  to  best  internal  control practices.  It  checks  the  control  procedures  implemented  by other  Departments  and  conducts  operational  and  financial audits within its remit. In 2021, in light of the pandemic, the Internal Audit Department conducted thirty-five audit assignments, excluding audits in stores.\n\nThe Internal Audit Department draws up the audit plan based, in  particular,  on  the  Group's  process  guidelines  and  on  the major  risks  identified  for  the  Houses.  It  takes  account  of special requests from senior management  and  other operational  departments.  These  projects  are  discussed  with the  main  persons  in  charge.  The  Audit  Committee  reviews and approves the final audit plan.\n\nThe  main  issues  identified  by  the  Internal  Audit  Department are  reported  to  the  Audit  Committee.  In  this  way,  the  Audit Committee is informed of the issues identified and the action plans set up by the entities concerned.\n\nApart  from  these  assignments,  all  of  the  Internal  Audit resources  in  the  Kering  group  are  dedicated  to  promoting internal control across all business processes and activities, be they  operational  or  financial,  related  to  stores,  warehouses or headquarters, distribution or manufacturing activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Their  rules  of conduct  are  described  in  their  Audit  Charter,  to  which  they refer.  A  new  version  of  the  Audit  Charter  was  published  in 2018. The Charter stipulates that:\n\n- \u00b7 at the end of each audit, the findings and recommendations are  presented  to  the  managers  of  the  area  or  areas concerned;\n- \u00b7 any  agreements  or  disagreements  made  known  by  the audited parties concerning the proposed recommendations are included in the final report, which specifies any action plan,  as  well  as  responsibilities  and  the  deadlines  for implementation;\n- \u00b7 the  operational  staff  members  concerned  are  responsible for implementing recommendations;\n- \u00b7 the Internal Audit Department is in charge of verifying their implementation.\n\nInternal Audit activities are performed in conjunction with the work  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  results  of  the  work performed by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Internal Audit Department updates the Audit Committee on progress made on the audit plan and the follow-up of the action plans at least once a year.\n\nIn  2013,  Kering's  Internal  Audit  Department  published  the following  referential  frameworks  that  establish  a  common methodology:  the  audit  manual  and  the  audit  approach.  In 2020, the approach to auditing stores was updated.\n\nIn December  2021,  Kering's  Internal  Audit  Department obtained  professional  certification  from  the  IFACI  (French Institute  of  Audit  and  Internal  Control)  that  it  conducts  its activities  in  accordance  with  the  mandatory  requirements  of the  International  Professional  Practices  Framework  of  the Institute  of  Internal  Auditors  (IIA).  This  seal  of  quality demonstrates that the Internal Audit Department adds value for  the  Group,  improves  its  operations  and  helps  it  to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach  to  evaluate  and  improve  the  effectiveness  of  risk management, control, and governance processes.\n\n## The Statutory Auditors\n\nThe Statutory Auditors review the internal control systems in order  to  certify  the  financial  statements.  They  do  so  by identifying  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  those  systems, assessing  the  risk  of  material  misstatement,  and,  where applicable, making recommendations. Under no circumstances do the Statutory Auditors take the place of the Company in implementing the internal control system.\n\nThe  role of the Statutory Auditors is to certify the completeness,  accuracy  and  fair  presentation  of  the  parent company and consolidated financial statements on an annual basis  and  issue  a  review  report  on  the  Group's  interim consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  audit  engagements  are  allocated  between  the  joint Statutory Auditors: Deloitte and KPMG.\n\nThe  main  matters  covered  by  the  Statutory  Auditors  are  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying  risk  areas  and  performing  tests  by  sampling  in order  to  validate  the  completeness,  accuracy  and  fair presentation  of  the  financial  statements  with  regard  to their individual or consolidated materiality threshold;\n- \u00b7 validating  the  main  types  of  accounting  treatment  and options  throughout  the  year,  in  coordination  with  the management of the activities and Kering;\n- \u00b7 applying the accounting standards defined by Kering for its activities;\n- \u00b7 preparing an audit report for each House, in order to certify Kering's  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  any comments on internal control;\n- \u00b7 presenting  a  general  overview  of  the  Kering  group  to Kering's Management and to the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 preparing  the  Statutory  Auditors'  reports  for  Kering's shareholders. These reports are presented in Chapter 6 of this Document.\n\n## 1.6.3 Risk management\n\nThe  Group's  risk  map  is  defined  based  on  various  sources  (see  diagram  below).  The  risk  factors  identified  are  subject  to  the mitigation measures presented in section 2 of this chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  the  annual  self-assessments  carried  out within the activities for each process identified, the managers in  charge  are  asked  to  assess  the  level  of  internal  control through key controls for their operations, in order to identify any weaknesses and implement corrective measures.\n\nSelf-assessment is not simply a reporting tool intended for the Internal Audit Department or the Audit Committee; it is also a system  that  allows  the  Executive  Management  teams  of  the activities to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the strength  of  the  internal  control  system.  Self-assessment makes  it  possible  to  strengthen  the  level  of  internal  control through operational action plans.\n\nThe approach used to analyze internal control is based on the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 a  self-assessment,  using  questionnaires,  conducted  with the key operational staff members in each of the activities following the breakdown of operations into key processes. In 2015, all of the questionnaires were reviewed in the light of  participants'  responses  during  the  previous  annual assessment  and  comments  from  those  conducting  the assessments.  Key  controls,  as  well  as  fraud  risk  controls, were also identified and added to these questionnaires in order  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  the  action  plans. The  self-assessment  campaign  now  covers  all  of  Kering's operations. The overhaul of the self-assessment questionnaires  continued  in  2019  in  order  to  make  them more effective and a better fit for the business operations. In  2021, the financial process questionnaires were revised to  reflect  the  changes  introduced  within  the  Group.  The entire  contents  of  the  self-assessment  questionnaires  are currently being reviewed. The work began in the second half of 2021 and will continue into 2022. The goal is to assess internal  control  through  updated  questionnaires  for  the 2022  self-assessment  questionnaire  campaign  featuring more  operational,  clearer and  more  concise  points reflecting  the  changes  in  the  Group's  processes  that  have undergone major transformations;\n- \u00b7 these  questionnaires  provide  operational  staff  with  an additional indicator for assessing the quality of the internal control procedures of which they are in charge. They make it possible  to  harmonize  the  level  of  internal  control applied  throughout  the  Group  and  for  all  activities  to benefit  from  best  practices,  in  particular  newly  acquired entities.  They  allow  action  plans  to  be  launched  based  on the results of these self-assessments;\n- \u00b7 the finance, accounting and management process questionnaire  takes  into  account  the  AMF's  reference framework  and,  in  particular,  its  application  guide.  It includes some 60 questions on the Group's mandatory key controls.  It  is  circulated  among  the  largest  subsidiaries  in the Group's activities. There was no change in the scope of processes covered in 2021.\n\nSince  2013,  the  Internal  Audit  Department  has  extended  its self-assessment procedures to stores throughout the Group's Houses.  These  self-assessments  give  the  sales  network managers an idea of the effectiveness of their internal control and  represent  a  teaching  aid  to  help  store  managers  meet their internal control obligations. The self-assessment questionnaire for the Group's stores was extensively revised in the  first  half  of  2020  to  (i)  take  into  account  changes  in  all store activities, (ii) clarify and simplify the questions and make them more relevant, and (iii) simplify the connection with the control  points  verified  during  in-store  audits  for  comparison purposes.  In  addition,  to  facilitate  the  use  of  the  results,  the frequency  of  self-assessment  campaigns  in  stores  was reduced  from  half-yearly  to  yearly.  This  approach  was presented and approved by the Kering Audit Committee.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group's  Finance  Department  continued  to implement the tool for continuously monitoring the transactional  activities  managed  by  the  Group,  within  the financial Shared Services Centers. It was deployed more widely across  financial  processes  in  accordance  with  the  Group's financial transformation project.\n\n## 1.7 Description of internal control procedures relating to the preparation of financial and accounting information\n\nFinancial and accounting information is prepared by the Group Finance  Department.  At  the  level  of  Kering,  this  department supervises  the  Financial  Control  Department  (which  includes the accounting, consolidation and management control teams), the  Financial  Communications  Department,  the  Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department and the Tax Department.\n\n## 1.7.1 Financial Control Department\n\nThe  production  and  analysis  of  financial  information  is  based on a set of financial management procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 medium-term plans, which measure the impact of strategic priorities  on  the  Group's  key  financial  and  management indicators. They are also used for the annual assessment by the  Group  of  the  value  in  use  of  assets  allocated  to  the various cash-generating units;\n- \u00b7 budgets,  which  are  drawn  up  on  the  basis  of  discussions between  the  operating  departments  and  the  members  of the  Group's  Executive  Management.  The  first  phase  takes place  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  fiscal  year  when  a preliminary budget sets out the main financial indicators and operating action plans. The second stage, which finalizes the budget, takes place in the first quarter of the following year and builds in any significant events that may have occurred in the meantime;\n- \u00b7 monthly  reporting  that  monitors  the  performance  of  the Group's  activities  throughout  the  fiscal  year  via  specific indicators whose consistency and reliability are reviewed by the  Financial  Control  Department.  This  department  also oversees  the  consistency  of  the  accounting  treatment applied  by  the  activities  with  Group  rules  and  carries  out, together  with  their  financial  controllers,  an  analytical review  by  comparison  with  the  budget  and  the  previous year;\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  control  is  carried  out,  in particular,  as  part  of  the  statutory  consolidation  process insofar  as  the  activities  are  required  to  provide  an exhaustive list of their commercial or financial commitments and to monitor them from year to year.\n\nThe  statutory  consolidation  of  the  financial  statements  is carried  out  at  the  end  of  June  and  December  using  the  Group consolidation  tool.  It  enables  financial  information  to  be transferred  from  the  activities  in  real  time  after  full  validation of  the  consolidation  reporting  packages  by  the  activities' Statutory Auditors and by the Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial  Officers  of  the  Houses,  who  commit  themselves  via a  signed  representation  letter,  thus  strengthening  the  quality of the financial information transferred.\n\nConsolidation levels within the activities provide a first level of control and consistency.\n\nKering's Financial Control Department coordinates the process and  is  in  charge  of  producing  the  Group's  consolidated financial statements. For this purpose, the Department sends instructions to the activities specifying the reports to be sent, the  common  assumptions  to  be  applied  and  the  specific points to be taken into account.\n\n## 1.7.2 Financial Communications Department\n\nThe  Financial  Communications  Department's  role  is  to produce and release the permanent and periodic information that makes up the regulatory information.\n\nIt conducts this role in line with a precise regulatory framework and in compliance with the key general principles applicable to financial reporting. The Financial Communications Department thereby upholds the principle of equal access to information for investors,  the  principle  of  consistent,  accurate,  precise  and fairly presented information and the full and effective release of regulated information.\n\nFinancial Communications forms a key component of market transparency  and  represents  a  core  pillar  of  investor confidence.  It  is  intended  for  a  diverse  range  of  audiences, mainly  consisting  of  institutional  investors,  retail  investors, (financial and non-financial) analysts and employees. Executive  Management,  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  the Financial  Communications  Department  are  the  contacts  for investment  analysts  and  investors.  The  Human  Resources Department  manages  information  about  employees,  in conjunction with the Financial Communications Department.\n\nThe  role  of  the  Financial  Communications  Department  also extends  to  non-financial  (CSR)  topics  in  its  dealings  with analysts and investors.\n\n## 1.7.3 Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department\n\nThe  Financing,  Treasury  and  Insurance  Department  manages liquidity, counterparty,  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate financial risks. It also coordinates the Group's cash management. It manages the Group's banking policy, establishes guidelines for the allocation of activity by bank, and coordinates Group calls for tender.  It  ensures  consistency  between  published  financial information  and  policies  governing  interest  rate,  foreign exchange  and  liquidity  risk  management.  Almost  all  of  the financing is set up by Kering or Kering Finance. Exceptions are analyzed  on  a  case-by-case  basis  according  to  specific opportunities or constraints and require Kering's agreement.\n\nThe Insurance Department, an integral part of the Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department, establishes and manages the  Group's  policy  on  insurance.  It  is  responsible  for identifying, quantifying and  handling  risks (prevention, self-insurance or transfer to insurers or reinsurers).\n\n## 1.7.4 Other Departments\n\nInternal  control  is  also  strengthened  by  the  centralization  of certain functions within Kering.\n\n## Legal Department\n\nApart  from  its  specific  function  at  Company  level,  the  Legal Department  assists  the  entire  Group  with  important  legal matters and coordinates analyses or studies common to the activities  or  of  significant  interest  for  the  Group.  It  also formulates  Group  policy  and  oversees  its  application.  It provides  the  Houses  with  a  methodology  for  identifying standard  risks  enabling  them  to  anticipate  such  risks  and inform the Legal Department.\n\n## Tax Department\n\nThe  Tax  Department  coordinates  the  Group's  tax  policy  and advises  and  assists  the  activities  on  all  issues  related  to  tax law, as well as on the implementation of tax consolidation in France.\n\n## Communications Department\n\nThe  Communications  Department  is  involved  in  the  Group's development  by  enhancing  its  image  and  reputation  both internally and externally.\n\n## Information Systems Department\n\nThe  Information  Systems  Department  is  responsible  for providing optimal operational performance, controlling IT risk and improving the Group's information systems.",

Kering's Houses do not operate any stores in Ukraine.\n\nNonetheless, Kering's direct exposure to the crisis currently remains limited as its combined sales in Ukraine and Russia amounted to around 1% of its annual revenue in 2021. The net value of its assets in those countries is not material.\n\nOver the longer term, the conflict, depending on its duration and extent, could affect global economic growth and therefore the luxury market.\n\nThe main risk arising from the current crisis situation is thus to growth -and first and foremost to the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and, to a lesser extent, to Kering's image and supply chain.\n\nGiven  the  current  instability,  cybersecurity  risks,  plus  financial  and  legal  risks,  have  increased,  but  Kering  believes  it  has taken the requisite measures to reduce as far as possible the likelihood of risks occurring and their impact.",

Continuous  interaction between  the  House  CEOs  and  Group  Management  promotes  dynamic  management  of  the  Houses  and  improved responsiveness. Furthermore, the Chief Executive Officers of the main Houses sit on Kering's Executive Committee, which gives the  Group  a  better  understanding  of  its  Houses'  needs  and  enables  it  to  maintain  permanent  dialogue  with  the  Creative Directors and support their creative process.\n\nRegular interaction between the Chief Executive Officer and the Creative Director of each House preserves its value and respect for its identity over time.

Even so, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic again affected the Group's operations in 2021, as a result of various lockdowns, restrictions on movement and a substantial, enduring drop in tourism during the year. The risks of new variants emerging could indeed pose a threat to business trends in 2022.\n\nThe ongoing health crisis  is  a  typical  and  unprecedented  example  of  a  major  crisis  significantly  and  persistently  affecting the global economy and having a material impact on the Group's revenue growth and profitability.\n\nEvents of this magnitude, whether they relate to a political crisis or instability, an industrial or natural disaster, or a public health issue, are rare. Moreover, as illustrated by the performance of the Group's brands by region, they affect the regions in which the Group operates unevenly.\n\nPast years have shown that, apart from major systemic or health crises, macro-economic and geopolitical instability can partly explain trends by region, but without significantly affecting the Group's overall performance.\n\nThe diversity of the brands' geographic footprints helps limit the Group's exposure to uncertainties or even to deterioration in a given country's economic or security environment. The Group's distribution network remains balanced across the regions: sales are made through a network of close to 1,600 directly operated stores, split almost evenly between mature markets and emerging  countries.  Direct  sales  (around  80%  of  revenue)  are  supplemented  by  sales  to  third  party  distributors,  and  the Group's broad spectrum of products makes it less dependent on any single category.\n\nBoth the Group's market positioning and strategy (see section 5 \"Our strategy\" of Chapter 1 'Presentation of the Group and Integrated Report' for more details) help limit the impacts of macro-economic cycles and uncertainty on its activities.\n\nAs  explained  in  the  overview  of  the  personal  luxury  goods  market  and  the  eyewear  market  (see  section  6  'Our  markets' of Chapter 1 'Presentation of the Group and Integrated Report'), besides cyclical factors or the COVID-19 crisis, which could end  in  the  short  or  medium  term,  the  Group  is  also  exposed  to  structural  medium-term  growth  patterns  related  to  the increase  in  the  world's  population  and  changes  in  the  population  mix.  Over  the  next  few  decades,  the  number  of  people belonging to the 'global middle class' is set to almost double, with Asia accounting for the bulk of this growth.\n\nLastly, the Group has demonstrated in the past its ability to adapt its organization, operating methods and strategic priorities in response to changes in the macro-economic and technological environment. Its level of profitability and of cash generation allows it to invest for the long term and to weather the sector's recessionary phases, even though the downward adjustment of cost bases remains a long and complex process in an industry where the proportion of fixed operating expenses is high.",

As restrictions began to ease, economic activity bounced back in spring 2020 in Asia and then during the summer for the world's mature economies. The recovery was more gradual during the second half in countries where the virus was circulating rapidly, especially in Western Europe.\n\nIn  the  first  few  months  of  2021,  although  the  public  health  situation  during  the  winter  resulted  in  general  or  targeted restrictions  on  movement  and  activities,  the  economic  rebound  gained  pace,  and  a  V-shaped  recovery  seemed  to  be occurring. Developments in the pandemic in the second half of the year, particularly the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, do not appear to have affected global growth very materially.\n\nDomestic consumer spending was strong, and the level of consumer confidence clearly drove growth in the global personal Luxury  goods  market  in  2021.  Low  tourist  numbers  continue  to  have  a  negative  impact,  without  eliminating  the  market upswing altogether. As a result, the rebound benefiting all luxury brands could be as high as 31% at constant exchange rates compared to 2020 (1) .\n\nOverall,  the  pandemic  had  a  limited  impact  on  Kering's  performance  in  2021.  However,  the  Group's  operations  were  still directly and indirectly impacted by the pandemic and its effects during the year.\n\n## Actions taken\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  had  implemented  a  number  of  measures  to  deal  with  the  consequences  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic focused on different aspects and at different levels.\n\nThe  rebound  in  the  luxury  goods  industry  in  2021,  and  more  broadly  a  slow,  but  gradual  improvement  in  the  pandemic situation, paved the way for the Group's Houses to get back closer to 'business as usual'.\n\nThe main actions taken in 2021 to manage the risks arising from the pandemic are as follows:\n\n## Design, manufacture, sourcing and logistics\n\n- \u00b7 Further investments to digitalize product design and marketing to a greater extent.\n- \u00b7 Systematic introduction of virtual sales campaigns.\n- \u00b7 Adjustment of collections and merchandising to spread the launch of new introductions over the course of the season more effectively, together with communication and event campaigns across the store network.\n- \u00b7 Acceleration  of  the  pace  of  transformation  of  the  logistics  activities  to  shorten  delivery  times,  achieve  greater  agility and bolster logistics capabilities across the regions.\n\n## Distribution and Customers\n\n- \u00b7 Growth in distance selling capacities and increased number of clienteling campaigns.\n- \u00b7 Steady  growth  in  online  sales  supported  by  the  Group's  investments  in  digital  platforms  and  the  development  of e-concessions (e-commerce penetration up to around 15% of retail channel sales by the Group's Luxury Houses in 2021 versus 13% in 2020).\n- \u00b7 Roll-out  of  the  strategy  to  enhance  the  exclusivity  of  the  distribution  network  and  streamline  sales  to  third-party distributors (3% decline in wholesale sales at constant exchange rates for the Group's Luxury Houses over 2 years, with a 39% decline for Gucci).\n\n## Stakeholders\n\n- \u00b7 Strict measures maintained to protect the health and safety of employees, suppliers and customers.\n- \u00b7 Introduction of sustainable homeworking agreements.\n- \u00b7 Establishment of procedures enabling employees to return on-site in line with the applicable health restrictions.\n- \u00b7 Strengthening of IT infrastructure and its security to facilitate the widespread take-up of remote working.\n- \u00b7 Help and support unit for employees kept in place.\n- \u00b7 Constant attention paid to protecting jobs and maintaining salary levels.\n- \u00b7 Further initiatives to support suppliers.\n\n## Financials\n\n- \u00b7 Delays to store openings or refurbishments given difficulties in conducting negotiations with property owners or launching building works as a result of the ongoing pandemic situation in certain regions during the first half of 2021.\n- \u00b7 Cost  base  adjustments:  mainly  linked  to  lease  renegotiations  and  a  review  of  administrative  expenses.  Conversely, the  Houses reinvested in communication, marketing and store operations to fully harness the opportunities created by the business rebound.\n- \u00b7 Reduction in credit risk, greater liquidity across the Group.\n- (1) Source: Bain - Altagamma Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study (report published in November 2021 and supplemented by a detailed report published in December 2021).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Transformation Office's role is to coordinate and align the Group's stakeholders, identify and anticipate risks, and help to embed and entrench the methodological aspects, where necessary.\n\nThe coordination and alignment of the Group's various projects depend on gaining an overarching view of:\n\n- 1. regularly reviewed business priorities presented in sufficient detail to reflect the constraints and opportunities, to make it actionable;\n- 2. all significant transformation projects conducted by the Group or the Houses covering all regions and all functional areas, to ensure that the projects are consistent and in line with the Group's strategic vision;\n- 3. need for methodological adjustments to ensure the more secure delivery of projects.\n\nIn addition to its consolidation work, the Transformation Office drafted or recommended various revisions to the Transformation Initiatives Leads, to make sure they achieve the objectives of the programs in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 the risks arising from interdependencies between programs;\n- \u00b7 the  methodological  aspects  with  areas  for  improvement  (e.g.,  change  management  framework,  risk  management framework, post-start-up feedback and tracking of take-up).",

Forecasting  systems have been introduced for purchasing and launching production according to the needs of various collections.\n\nCritical  points  in  production  management  can  be  detected  early  on  in  the  process  thanks  to  continuous  interaction  with suppliers.\n\nEnsuring the quality of goods and compliance with stringent safety standards is among the Group's main priorities. To protect the  Group's  reputation,  the  products  sold  by  its  Houses  must  combine  distinctive  appeal  with  flawless  quality,  while  also guaranteeing absolute safety for customers. In order to bring high quality products to market that are compliant with these standards, the Group implements quality control processes covering all of the stages in the product lifecycle, from design to marketing. Products are classified using quality and safety standards, while suppliers are listed on the basis of technical audits and  adherence  to  the  Group  Suppliers'  Charter.  Product  quality  and  safety  controls  are  carried  out  at  all  stages  of  the production process by quality engineers and accredited laboratories.\n\nThe  Product  Compliance  teams  support  the  Houses  in  developing  and  distributing  products  that  comply  with  legal requirements  in  each  market  and  with  the  Group's  Product  Restricted  Substance  List  (PRSL),  which  specifically  lists  the substances to be removed or thresholds not to be exceeded, as well as the highest existing standards for the disposal of hazardous  chemicals.  In  2021,  the  organization  was  strengthened  by  the  addition  of  the  Test  &  Innovation  Lab  (TIL),  a dedicated ISO/IEC 17025 (Accredia) lab performing over 170 test protocols, capable of testing all raw materials and finished products to underpin innovation and quality control.\n\nAll Kering businesses have a 'product' crisis management unit. In the event of a known risk, they follow procedures ensuring that immediate and transparent information is provided to the public, and that defective products are recalled.\n\nLastly, the Group has also taken out civil liability insurance to cover bodily harm or property damage to third parties caused by products considered defective (see section 2.7 'Insurance and risk treatment' of this chapter).\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to product quality and safety are presented in detail in section 5.2.4 'Product quality control, and consumer health and safety' of Chapter 4 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault is involved personally in developing and implementing the anti-corruption program within Kering and its Houses, both internally and externally. He is supported by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus in his capacity as Group Managing Director and by the Board of Directors, particularly within the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee, and is supported by the House CEOs, who are also personally involved in the development and implementation of the compliance program. Their collective commitment forms the 'Tone at the top' approach of Kering and its Houses. Locally, the structure of the compliance function described below allows for a 'Tone from the middle' approach implemented personally at Region and House levels by the Compliance Officers, who  are  mostly  local  managers  selected  in  large  part  so  that  they  can  use  their  position  within  the  Group  to  relay management's commitment across all levels of the organization.\n\nIn  2015,  the  Group  set  up  a  dedicated  function  responsible  for  developing  and  supervising  the  implementation  of  a compliance program meeting the requirements of France's Sapin II law, among other aspects. It is headed by the Group Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Audit Committee. To ensure the day-to-day monitoring and effectiveness of the compliance program, the Group Chief Compliance Officer is supported by (i) a team of five compliance law experts working in Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo, (ii) a network of Brand Compliance Officers appointed by the House CEOs, and (iii) a network of Regional and Local Compliance Officers. In some Houses, there are compliance managers in addition to the Brand and Local Compliance Officers.\n\nThe  anti-corruption  compliance  program  in  place  within  Kering  and  its  Houses  meets  the  requirements  of  international standards, and more particularly the eight pillars required under Article 17 of the Sapin II law. The Group Chief Compliance Officer  attends  at  least  one  meeting  of  the  Audit  Committee  each  year  to  report  to  its  members  on  the  status  of  the compliance program and its implementation. The Audit Committee ensures that compliance risks are sufficiently mitigated and  that  the  Compliance  Officers  have  the  appropriate  resources.  The  Committee  also  discusses  the  annual  compliance objectives  to  be  assigned  by  the  Remuneration  Committee  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group Managing Director. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director also meet regularly with the Group Chief Compliance Officer.\n\n## Risk map:\n\nFollowing an initial assessment of corruption risks used to draw up a risk map in 2016-2017, which was updated in 2018, the Group performed an in-depth assessment of corruption and influence peddling risks in its operations and in the operations of each of  its  Houses  around  the  world  in  2019.  This  assessment  was  run  over  a  period  of  nine  months  by  an  independent specialist  law  firm  working  with  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  and  her  teams,  and  involved  more  than  242  Group employees across all regions, functions and management levels, identified by process and sub-process. To ensure that the risk assessment  was  comprehensive,  each  potential  corruption  and  influence  peddling  scenario  relevant  to  the  Group  was identified and assessed after analyzing first, second and third levels of control included non-compliant hiring, cash payments, gifts,  hospitality  and  entertainment,  sponsorship  and  donations,  relations  with  third  parties  (including  real  estate transactions), discounts, CRM program, inventory, and mergers and acquisitions. The risks with these potential corruption and influence peddling scenarios were then rated and ranked in a preliminary risk map. The action plan adopted following this risk mapping exercise was rolled out in 2021.\n\nMoreover, the corruption and influence peddling risk map was updated during 2021 to take into account the stricter controls introduced in 2020, as well as the findings of a compliance reviews and internal audits undertaken in 2020 and 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management:\n\n## \u00b7 Prevention:\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  have  a  Code  of  Ethics  prefaced  by  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Executive Committee, supplemented by a specific anti-corruption policy. The Code of Ethics, the anti-corruption policy and the internal control  procedures  and  dedicated  compliance  procedures  of  the  Group  and  the  Houses  were  revised  following  the  2019 update of the corruption risk map. Guidelines have also been issued to assist Group employees with applying them in the situations identified as being most at risk.\n\nDue  diligence procedures  for  all  direct  and  indirect  suppliers,  acquisition  targets,  joint  venture  and  consortium  partners, retailers, as well as beneficiaries of sponsorships and donations, have also been tightened so as to better prevent the risks of corruption, fraud, money laundering and violation of economic sanctions. These procedures round out the Hercules project.\n\nIn  addition,  employees  identified  as  being  most  exposed  to  corruption  and  influence  peddling  risk  are  given  customized training  to  enhance  first-level  control  over  the  new  procedures.  These  in-person  training  sessions,  which  were  delivered to  2,000  employees  in  2021,  complement  the  mandatory  Ethics  and  Compliance  e-learning  courses  for  all  the  Group's employees, which are presented in greater detail in Chapter 4, section 2, 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business'.\n\n## \u00b7 Detection:\n\nA  procedure  is  in  place  for  reporting  concerns,  and  as  such  to  detect  potential  corruption  risks.  The  management  of  this system is described in greater detail in Chapter 4, section 2, 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business'.\n\nSecond-level compliance audits to ensure the proper implementation of the compliance program and detect corruption risks are carried out on and off site by the Group Compliance Department, with the support of an international law firm to reinforce the independence and expertise of the analysis in the most at-risk jurisdictions identified in the risk map. Compliance reviews were  carried  out  in  China,  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  India,  Thailand,  Vietnam,  Singapore,  Malaysia,  Guam,  Australia  and New Zealand. They gave rise to the development of local plans to remedy the shortcomings identified. The results are also taken into account in the rating of the implementation of anti-corruption controls assessed in the regularly updated risk map.\n\nThe Internal Audit Department also regularly performs third-level audits to determine whether Group procedures, including compliance procedures, are applied.\n\n## \u00b7 Remediation:\n\nCorruption risk map updates, compliance reviews and internal audits are conducted to identify potential shortcomings to a greater extent, which Kering and its Houses then remedy, with the aim of continuously improving the compliance program. For example, the corruption risk identified as being the most material for the Group when the risk map was updated in 2019 relates  to  relationships  with  third  parties,  particularly  business  partners  or  in  the  context  of  real  estate  transactions. Accordingly, the Group updated in late 2019 its third-party due diligence procedure to strengthen controls over distributors, lessors and service providers involved in the creation and renovation of stores.\n\nLastly,  the  whistleblowing  system  set  up  by  the  Group  also  helps  the  Group  identify  and  take  action  to  deal  with  any misconduct.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each  House  is  implementing  a refurbishment program to make sure its stores remain eye-catching and productive.\n\nA profitability study and an assessment of the strategic and operational benefits are carried out prior to every investment decision related to the network. One-off studies may be carried out two or three years after the investment to ensure the business plan has been executed properly.\n\nIn addition, Houses track their main retail indicators closely and regularly to anticipate any store optimization decisions, such as, for example, increased staffing levels in the stores, extensions or overhaul of the retail space.\n\nWithin the framework of the wholesale distribution network, contracts are regularly reviewed by the Houses' teams with the support of the Group's Legal Department to ensure each House's distribution network is optimal and efficient. In addition, a team from Kering's  Finance  Department  tracks  the  solvency  of  all  the  Group's  wholesale  accounts  and  monitors  payment collection.\n\nSince late 2019, the Group has been streamlining the wholesale channel. This has resulted in a decline in revenue and, in certain cases, especially for the e-tailers, a switchover to a concession format.\n\nThe Group prevents sales of its products by parallel distribution networks by ensuring the traceability of its goods, prohibiting direct sales to these networks (grey market) and implementing specific measures to tighten control over these distribution channels.",

This training also aims to instill a culture of equality and inclusion, for example by combating stereotyping and unconscious biases that could be at odds with the Group's values and thus harm its image.\n\nThe Houses are also in regular discussions with the Group to anticipate risks  arising  from  the  use  of  potentially  sensitive images and messages in their communication.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also develops  synergies  within  the  production  chain  by  means  of  acquisitions  or  strategic  business  partnerships  in  the subcontracting market.\n\nThe Group also ensures that its suppliers and subcontractors comply with its standards in terms of ethics and responsible business conduct and in particular with its Group Suppliers' Charter, which is included in the Kering Code of Ethics. The Group ensures that its suppliers abide by the applicable laws and regulations and that its supplies meet international standards.\n\nIn  addition, the Group has defined standards for the supply of all its key raw materials, published in 2018 and updated in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The standards focus on five areas: social impact, environmental impact, traceability, use of chemicals and animal welfare. They serve as a guide for assessing the compliance of raw materials suppliers and present two levels of expectations:  minimum  requirements  and  best  practices  to  be  achieved  by  2025  at  the  latest,  in  line  with  the  Group's sustainability strategy and its 2025 targets.\n\nTo align its practices with its commitments and drive industry-wide progress towards treatment of animals that is safer, more just and more humane, Kering believes that it has a duty to apply the highest standards in the area of animal welfare. In the sustainability  strategy  adopted  by  the  Group,  the  welfare  of  animals,  and  particularly  of  livestock,  is  associated  with environmental stewardship, safer working conditions and, more generally, a higher level of supplier performance.\n\nIn this vein, in 2019 the Group published specific standards on animal welfare to ensure that animals are treated as humanely as possible throughout the Group's supply chains.\n\nThe quality, safety and stability of the Group's supplies of animal and plant-based raw materials depend on strict compliance with the standards in this regard, and first and foremost with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and on the sustained equilibrium of ecosystems, some of which are already under threat. To meet  the  crucial  challenges  related  to  biodiversity,  its  preservation  and  restoration,  the  Group  published  its  biodiversity strategy in 2020, setting new specific and ambitious objectives aimed at achieving a 'net positive impact'* on biodiversity by 2025.  Measures  taken  include  the  launch  of  the  Kering  Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature  created  by  Keirng  and  Conservation International to support the fashion industry's transition to regenerative agriculture.\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to the Group's raw materials and the protection of biodiversity are presented in detail in sections 3.2.5 'Environmental impact of  our  operations'  and  4.2  'Preserving  natural  capital  across  our  entire  supply  chain'  of  Chapter  4  'Sustainability'  of  this Universal Registration Document.",

These teams manage the following tasks: (i) providing assistance to the Houses in connection with site openings, relocations and outlets, (ii) acquiring real estate, (iii) defining and developing projects, (iv) managing work in stores, warehouses and offices, and (v) managing owned or leased sites for Kering Corporate.\n\nThe  Group  implements  various  measures  to  limit  real  estate-related  risk,  including  (i)  systematic  reviews  of  contracts, (ii) separate invoicing, and (iii) steering committees for projects perceived as significant.\n\nThe Group has put in place a strategy to limit construction-related risk, including (i) the implementation of a procedure for executing and monitoring construction projects, (ii) the use of standard contracts across regions, and (iii) calls for tender that include verification of the financial and technical viability of the contractors consulted. Furthermore, Kering seeks to obtain environmental performance labels (e.g., BREEAM, LEED) for the majority of its properties.\n\nTo  ensure  that  new  partners  comply  with  the  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  the  Compliance  Department  carries  out compliance audits.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  up  a  network  of  real  estate  experts,  present  in  key  countries,  so  that  it  can  leverage  the  expertise  of employees  who  know  the  market's  specific  characteristics  plus  local  laws  and  regulations,  and  also  have  the  necessary negotiating skills.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business continuity and recovery plans are regularly updated, and their efficacy closely monitored.\n\nWith the support of the Houses' security departments, the Group is introducing data protection and business continuity plans.\n\nAs  part  of  the  introduction  of  data  protection  governance  in  compliance  with  the  GDPR,  the  Group  Data  Privacy  Officer  is involved in these initiatives.\n\nThe following actions are implemented every year to assess the level of compliance of the Group's information systems:\n\n- \u00b7 penetration testing ( pentests ) on applications and simulated logical/physical attacks ( Red Team );\n- \u00b7 network vulnerability scans and applications;\n- \u00b7 continuous cloud infrastructure audits;\n- \u00b7 review of patch management procedures and obsolescence management;\n- \u00b7 review of backup procedures.\n\nThe Group has increased IT security, notably through a transformation plan, and stepped up employee awareness initiatives by  implementing  a  large  number  of  control  and  protection  measures,  including  establishing  procedures,  and  developing targeted IT security systems. All employees have been trained to detect malicious emails, including via phishing simulation exercises conducted throughout the year. Moreover, the Group has developed e-learning modules on cybersecurity and data confidentiality, in addition to one on security and remote working. Best security practices in various areas ( phishing , malware , passwords, etc.) were also circulated via the Group's various internal communication channels during 2021.\n\nThe Group has taken significant steps to protect customer data:\n\n- \u00b7 customer data used outside the production environment is anonymized;\n- \u00b7 access to customer data is restricted to authorized persons;\n- \u00b7 risk assessments are carried out on all projects implemented by the Group, in order to identify requirements in terms of data security, confidentiality, integrity, traceability and availability, and thereby define the appropriate security measures;\n- \u00b7 non-disclosure  agreements  are  signed  with  external  service  providers  and  security  clauses  are  included  in  the  Group's contracts with suppliers;\n- \u00b7 a customer identity management platform has been acquired in order to secure the authentication process.\n\nTo manage security incidents that could have an impact on personal data or more broadly on operations, the Group has set up a  Security Operating Center on hand 24/7 and responsible for detecting and resolving security threats and events, such as identity fraud, malware and information leaks.\n\nIn  addition,  the  information  systems  department  (Kering  Technologies)  regularly  conducts  audits  on  key  applications  and information systems.",

Accordingly, it uses derivatives either to hedge foreign currency trade receivables and payables, or to hedge highly probable forecast exposures and/or firm commitments.\n\nHedging periods are aligned with each House's business cycle and only marginally exceed one year at each reporting date.\n\nThe Group also hedges foreign exchange risk on financial assets and liabilities issued in foreign currencies by using currency swaps for refinancing purposes or by investing cash in euros or local currency.\n\nNote 22.2 to the annual consolidated financial statements sets out the nature of the hedging instruments held by the Group and its exposure to foreign exchange risk (\"Exposure and sensitivity to foreign exchange risk\").\n\nKering Finance SNC processes, controls and provides administrative support for foreign exchange transactions on behalf of Group  companies.  Tasks  are  properly  segregated  to  ensure  proper  transactions  security  (Front-,  middle-,  back-office  and accounting  tasks).  Treasury  Department  organsiation  ensure  that  derivatives  contracted  internally  are  unwound  on  the market. Kering Finance SNC uses market-standard techniques and information systems to price currency instruments.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nThe  Group  trades  in  its  own  securities  either  directly  or  through  derivatives  as  part  of  its  stock  repurchase  program  in accordance with applicable regulations. Kering has also entered into an agreement with a financial intermediary to foster the liquidity of its shares and ensure share price quotation compliance. This agreement complies with the Professional Code of Conduct drawn up by the French association of financial and investment firms (Association fran\u00e7aise des march\u00e9s financiers AMAFI) and approved by the French financial markets authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF).\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Kering held 624,211 treasury shares, representing just 0.5% of its share capital and confirming its low level of exposure in this regard. Kering also retained a 3.96% interest in PUMA, after selling 5.91% of its shares in 2021, further reducing its exposure in this respect.\n\nAdditional information on equity risk is provided in Note 22.3 to the annual consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nKering may need to use derivatives such as swaps or purchases of options to guard against changes in interest rates. Kering Finance  SNC  processes,  controls  and  provides  administrative  support  for  interest  rate  transactions  on  behalf  of  Group companies. Front-, middle,  back-office  and  accounting  tasks  are  separated  for  security  reasons.  Kering  Finance  SNC  uses market-standard techniques and information systems to price interest rate instruments.\n\nNote 22.1 to the annual consolidated financial statements sets out the Group's exposure to interest rate risk (\"Exposure and sensitivity to interest rate risk\").",

According to the Group entities' experts and advisors, no litigation currently in progress concerning Group companies presents a risk for the normal course of the Group's business or its future development. Provisions have been set aside in the Group's 2021 consolidated financial statements to cover all of the above-mentioned legal risks, including the impact of commitments given on the disposal of controlling interests (see Note 25). None of these risks have been qualified as arising outside the scope of the normal course of business for Group companies.\n\nThe Group considers that the effective methods and procedures for identifying and managing its industrial and environmental risks  within  each  of  the  entities  concerned,  which  rely  chiefly  on  the  advice  of  duly  authorized  external  organizations  and advisors, meet, in terms of relevance and proportion, customary technical and professional standards under the prevailing regulatory framework. An active prevention and safety policy are an integral part of these methods and procedures.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Group  has  granted  various  vendor  representations  and  warranties  in  connection  with  disposals  of controlling interests in subsidiaries made over the last ten years (see Note 31 to the 2021 consolidated financial statements).\n\nAs regards the laws and regulations applicable to the Group's activities (excluding possible international sanctions that may be imposed against certain countries but have no impact on the Group's activities), Kering's businesses are subject to the same constraints and obligations as those directly applicable to its competitors on its different markets. None of the businesses are subject to specific rules or exemptions in any of the relevant territories.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any foreseeable regulatory or legislative changes in contradiction with the foregoing.\n\nTo  the  Company's  knowledge,  during  the  last  12  months  or  more,  there  have  been  no  governmental,  legal,  or  arbitration proceedings (including any pending or threatened proceedings of which the issuer is aware) that have had in the recent past, or are likely to have in the future, a significant impact on the financial position or earnings of the issuer or the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Contract management\n\nThe  Group  is  not  significantly  dependent  on  any  patents,  licenses  or  third-party  supply  sources.  The  Group  owns  or  has licensed rights to the trademarks, patents and intellectual property rights that it exploits, free of any restrictions on the right of priority or use (and of rights likely to restrict such exploitation) in all relevant markets. The same applies to the corporate names and domain names of the subsidiaries or entities, to the names of the Group's stores and points of sale (see above, risk factor 'Real estate management') and to the trademarks and signs of the goods and services manufactured or marketed by the various Group entities. This situation does not preclude any of the trademarks belonging to the Group being licensed to third parties for the sale of goods or services under its trademark enhancement policy, as has been the case in fragrances and cosmetics. In all cases, any such licensing agreements have been entered into under fair commercial and financial terms and conditions and have no impact on the ownership of the trademarks and signs belonging to the Group.\n\nFurther  information  on  contractual  obligations  and  other  commitments  is  provided  in  Notes  21  and  31  to  the  2021 consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group has strengthened its teams, particularly in the Legal Department and the shared services centers, to ensure that contracts  have  been  properly  set  up  with  the  Group's  suppliers.  Since  2015,  the  Hercules  program  has  strengthened  the shared, standardized approach to supply chain management between the Houses.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nThe  Kering  group  regards  intellectual  property  used  in  the  creative  and  innovation  processes  of  its  Houses  as  crucially important and has established a master intellectual property protection and defense policy adhered to by the Group's Houses.\n\nFor  this  purpose,  the  Group  has  formed  and  retains  legal  organizations  at  regional  (Asia,  the  Americas  and  Europe),  local (Houses and subsidiaries) and central levels specialized in intellectual property management.\n\nIn  line  with  the  general  directives  introduced  by  Kering,  the  Legal  departments  of  the  Group's  Houses  take  steps  to  make  sure products do not infringe the rights of third parties and determine which elements need protecting. The intellectual property rights portfolio is reviewed and updated on a regular basis to reflect and protect the activities of the Group's Houses.\n\nLastly, Kering works to protect its rights and is active in the campaign against counterfeiting in all its markets, as this can have an impact on revenue and damage the reputation of the Group and its products.\n\nThe Group takes steps to combat the various breaches of its rights, the sale and trafficking of counterfeit goods or copied goods, as well as imitations that devalue the creative work of the Houses.\n\nIn physical markets, this policy is implemented through customs seizures, police raids and legal action and on the internet by withdrawals of advertising and investigations followed by litigation.\n\nLitigation  is  overseen  by  the  Houses'  Legal  departments,  according  to  the  general  policy  principles  recommended  by  the Group with the help of the Group's legal units and external advisors, in conjunction with the competent authorities at local level (subsidiaries).\n\nThe cost of protecting rights is borne by the legal functions and aligned with the Group's scale and size.\n\n## Compliance with the statutory framework protecting personal data\n\nAs a Luxury group, the Kering group collects customer data that could potentially have a higher market value than similar data in other  industries.  Aware  of  the  risk  of  inappropriate  use  of  this  data  and  the  development  of  legislation  in  this  regard,  Kering  is working on developing a single compliance program to ensure that all of its Houses treat these issues in a structured and consistent manner, while strengthening its sales and IT and digital strategy.\n\nKering laid down its official position in this area in March 2021 with a formal commitment by management to the values it intends to uphold in the protection of personal data. The same formal undertakings were made by each of the Group's Houses to ensure they are effective.\n\nIn addition, Kering and all the Houses pay scrupulous attention to privacy issues with all international data transfers of personal data,  with  knowledge  about  data  flows  increasingly  crucial.  The  Group  and  its  Houses  have  pledged  to  embark  on  a comprehensive review of all their contractual ties with their essential partners to ensure these can provide sufficient evidence that they can provide appropriate technical and organizational safeguards and, more generally, that all cross-border data flows are afforded a level of protection substantively equivalent to that required in the European Union. In parallel, studies are being carried out to align this approach, principally focused on the situation in Europe, in the future with other relevant legislation, such as the recent Chinese data protection law ('Personal Information Protection Law' or 'PIPL').\n\nAs part of a more cross-disciplinary approach, Kering has drawn up plans to overhaul certain of its processes to address the increasing  complexity  of  the  data  protection  legislation.  For  example,  a  number  of  data  protection  authorities  have  clamped down  on  cookies  and  other  tracing  techniques,  requiring  websites  to  pay  greater  attention  to  their  legal  and  operational compliance issues. Accordingly, existing processes are reviewed and integrated to better accommodate local legislation and the latest digital challenges through an internal transformation program supported by legal, digital and IT specialists.\n\nLastly,  Kering  has  introduced mandatory training to nurture an internal culture that places value on privacy and genuinely accommodates the IT security priorities. Thanks to the major effort made by each House, 90.41% of employees worldwide attended this preliminary training in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering is also committed to ensuring that all Group entities pay all of the taxes due in each of the countries where they operate.\n\nTo  that  end,  the  Kering  group  can  rely  on  a  competent  team  of  tax  specialists  in  each  of  its  regions  as  well  as  at  its headquarters, all highly skilled and benefiting from ongoing training.\n\nTo understand the various tax-related issues that may arise, the Kering group Tax Department is tasked notably with:\n\n- \u00b7 consolidating tax information from all Group companies;\n- \u00b7 understanding  and  monitoring  tax  issues  that  arise  at  national  or  international  level  and  coordinating  responses  in compliance with the applicable laws and standards;\n- \u00b7 ensuring that intra-group transactions are documented as required;\n- \u00b7 providing technical support on tax-related matters during the preparation of consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Tax Department has therefore implemented a number of verification and control tools to help identify and resolve any tax issues  that  may  arise  within  the  Group  and  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  applicable  national  tax  laws  and  international standards. These tools include: regular analyses of comparable information to ensure that intra-group transactions are carried out  on  an  arm's  length  basis;  annual  reviews  of  Group  entities;  and  close,  detailed  monitoring  of  any  tax  audits  to  which Group entities are subject.\n\nIn addition, the Tax Department actively ensures that all Group entities:\n\n- \u00b7 allocate the human and financial resources necessary to conduct their business;\n- \u00b7 only have a presence in countries where they actually conduct business;\n- \u00b7 comply  with  the  applicable  national  laws  and  international  standards  on  transfer  pricing.  To  this  end,  it  develops  and updates  all  of  the  necessary  documentation  in  this  regard  and  provides  the  relevant  resources,  such  as  analyses  of comparable transactions and functional analyses;\n- \u00b7 cooperate fully with local tax authorities and government agencies and, where relevant, share their experience and expertise.",

Potential loss of know-how among the Group's teams or among the craftspeople and manufacturers within the supply chain or the communities from which the Group sources key and/or specific raw materials.\n\n## Example case(s)\n\n- \u00b7 Departure of senior executives:  inability  to  find,  in  a  timely  manner,  a  suitable  successor  for  an  Executive  Management position  (Chairman/Chief  Executive  Officer,  Group  Managing  Director,  Executive  Committee  member),  as  the  result  of departure or incapacity.\n- \u00b7 Unexpected departure of a Creative Director, leading to a period of uncertainty that could have a significant impact on the brand (particularly in terms of image and reputation, asset write-downs, etc.). However, any luxury goods company may have to face and manage this risk at some time.\n- \u00b7 Dilution of technical craftsmanship in transformation, cutting and assembly. Extinction of traditional crafts.\n- \u00b7 Diffciulty to keep talent: loss of key employees to competitors.\n- \u00b7 The luxury industry is supported by numerous manufacturing communities worldwide. They are subject to the risk of social, economic and operational tensions, such as community problems, disruptions to production and a shrinking talent pool.\n\n## Actions taken\n\nKering's Human resources policy aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 establish a long-term hiring strategy through international partnerships with schools and training organizations, and thus attract the best talent;\n- \u00b7 create a work environment that is motivating, collaborative, inclusive and respectful of each individual;\n- \u00b7 encourage commitment to the Group and its values through training programs, talent management and an appropriate remuneration policy;\n- \u00b7 promote inclusion, diversity and gender equality;\n- \u00b7 pay constant attention to working conditions, employee well-being and work-life balance;\n- \u00b7 develop internal mobility and opportunities for personal and professional growth.\n\nKering  has  set  itself  the  priority  of  developing  talent,  and  has  therefore  put  in  place  tools  and  processes  geared  towards helping  employees  constantly  expand  their  career  prospects  and  strengthen  their  skills  through  mobility  and  career opportunities.\n\nSince 2018, Kering has developed a single digital platform for all employees worldwide, enabling it to standardize management processes and simplify and speed up the data sharing required to manage talent globally, in a more transparent way.\n\nSince 2019, weekly updates have been made available on the communication platform for all employees giving them a clear picture  of  the  vacancies  within  the  various  Houses.  A  new  communication  campaign  encouraging  internal  mobility  was launched in 2021.\n\nAn employee survey was conducted in April 2021 covering the entire workforce to measure staff engagement and build a Group-wide  action  plan,  which  was  unveiled  in  September  2021.  Each  House  then  adapted  it  to  fit  its  own  specific environment, including the countries in which it operates.\n\nThese measures included strengthening the well-being policies (already being piloted within the Houses) and ongoing efforts to support employees with mental health issues.\n\nThe  Baby  Leave policy  launched  in  2020  entitles  all  employees  worldwide  to  14  weeks'  leave  on  full  pay  upon  becoming parents, including fathers and partners, and is now an integral part of the employee experience.\n\nTo maintain the know-how of its luxury businesses over the long term, Kering runs personnel training and skills preservation initiatives,  and  has  internalized  a  number  of  functions  that  were  previously  subcontracted.  Talent  development  is  a cornerstone  of  Kering's  HR  policy,  and  training  is  one  of  its  key  levers.  With  Kering  Learning,  the  Group  now  has  a  digital training  platform  for  all  employees  providing  a  shared  foundation  for  all  Houses.  Training  is  accessible  in  multi-channel formats, thereby making content more accessible via mobile.\n\nA talent review is also carried out each year by the Executive Committee - the starting point for the succession plan for key positions within the Group, as set out in section 2.2.6 of Chapter 3.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There is a close relationship between a luxury brand and its Creative Director, whose attitude has to reflect the values of the brand and respect the Group's own values. The departure of a Creative Director gives rise to a period of uncertainty that could have a significant impact on the brand (particularly in terms of image and reputation, asset write-downs, etc.). However, any luxury goods company may have to face and manage this risk at some time. Kering's brand portfolio nevertheless helps limit the impact of this risk at Group level.\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to  talent  management  are  presented  in  detail  in  sections  3.1  'Supporting  our  employees'  and  5.3.1  'Community  impact and preservation of know-how' of Chapter 4 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.",

By working in partnership with its suppliers and stakeholders to curb these risks and by sharing best practices, Kering protects the reputation of the Group and its Houses and maintains the appeal of their creations.\n\nThis vital undertaking is set out in the Group's Code of Ethics, in particular the aspects relating to fundamental freedoms and human rights in the Group's Suppliers' Charter, which is included in the Code, and in the Sustainability Principles for suppliers. These documents are part of the contractual framework governing relationships with suppliers.\n\nA Human Rights policy has also been drafted at Group level and covers both Kering's operations and its supply chains.\n\nIn  2017, Kering mapped the risks specific to its own activities and those of its value chain for the luxury business, as well as conducting  a  gap  analysis  pinpointing  differences  between  the  Group's  internal  practices  and  the  United  Nations  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In 2020, Kering also carried out an internal risk assessment to identify and evaluate risks  related  to  human  rights  in  connection  with  the  sourcing  of  certain  key  raw  materials.  This  analysis  factored  in  aspects regarding the countries from which suppliers operate. In 2021, to fulfill its duty of care, Kering carried out a second, more indepth assessment of the risks related to human rights and fundamental freedoms concerning its activities and its supply chain. The  assessments  were  also  incorporated  in  the  Group's  overall  map,  and  an  action  plan  was  drawn  up  to  address  areas  for improvement detected during this exercise.\n\nIn addition, the whistleblowing system is open to everyone working for the Group: employees and interns of Kering and its Houses, as well as external and temporary personnel working for external partners or service providers under contract with the Group. It can be used to report any suspected violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms within the Group and its supply chains. An information  and  communication  campaign  was  rolled  out  in  2020  and  repeated  in  2021  to  provide  the  direct  suppliers  of  the Group's Houses and their employees with a reminder of the Group's key ethical principles, particularly with respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms, and of the existence of the Group's ethics whistleblowing system, which is at their disposal.\n\nLastly, work began in 2020 on rolling out a collaborative portal with a view to optimizing communication between Kering and its suppliers. The aim is to provide suppliers with easy access to training and key Kering documents - including on human rights but also greater transparency on supply chains. The supplier integration and training drive continued actively in 2021, with the system now covering several hundred suppliers of Kering and its Houses.\n\nIn addition, the Group has adopted a stringent control strategy in the area of human rights, which includes but is not limited to the social audits conducted each year across thousands of Group suppliers and service providers.\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms are presented in section 3 'Duty of care plan' in this Chapter and in section 2.5 'Protection of human rights' of Chapter 4 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Lack  of  foresight,  resilience  or  Group initiatives in response to the effects of climate change.\n\n## Example case(s)\n\n- \u00b7 Supply chain: the growing frequency of extreme weather events (drought, flooding, etc.) could have a direct impact on the availability and quality of key raw materials such as cotton, leather, cashmere and silk, which would translate into greater price volatility, and thus affect the production and distribution of finished products.\n- \u00b7 Economic environment and even the social stability of certain regions (such as coastal regions in Asia) could be severely impacted by the effects of climate change, which would further increase pressure on the Group's supply chain.\n- \u00b7 Manufacturing disruptions caused by the unavailability or decreased quality of raw materials, due to climate change and its impact on biodiversity and on the destruction of land and ecosystems.\n- \u00b7 Stricter  environmental  regulations  and  standards  to  meet  the  challenges  associated  with  climate  change,  carbon  tax potentially having an impact on the Group's activities by increasing production costs and reducing operational flexibility.\n- \u00b7 Inaccurate forecasting of consumer demand for responsible products.\n\n## Actions taken\n\nIn the global economic and political outlook, climate change has become a key issue that demands an effective response.\n\nThe  physical  effects  of  climate  change  could  impact  the  Group's  operations.  While  its  own  activities  (production  and distribution) are relatively unexposed due to their low carbon footprint (Kering's activities are not subject to carbon emissions quota  regulations),  this  is  not  the  case  for  the  supply  chain.  A  2015  report  entitled  'Climate  change:  implications  and strategies for the fashion and luxury sector' jointly authored with BSR analyzed exposure to climate risk, focusing on existing and future climate risks threatening cotton, cashmere, vicu\u00f1a wool, silk as well as cow, calf, sheep and lambskin leather.\n\nIn 2021, Kering published its Climate strategy setting out in detail the commitments, objectives and actions implemented by the Group to make its supply chains more resilient, starting with the introduction of the Environmental Profit and Loss (EP&L) statement.  This  tool  first  introduced  in  2012  allows  Kering  to  measure  its  environmental  impacts,  including  its  carbon footprint, throughout the value chain and to monetize them. Beyond the risk management dimension, the EP&L is also used as a management tool to orient the Group towards sustainable sourcing solutions and to assess the raw materials used in product design.\n\nThe Group has set very ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint by 2025. Kering was the first Luxury group to be verified and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its carbon footprint reduction targets back in 2017. These  were  revised  in  2020  and  validated  in  2021  to  align  them  with  the  1.5\u00b0C  scenario  by  2030,  in  keeping  with  the commitments made as part of the Fashion Pact in 2019.\n\nFurthermore, Kering has abided by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), of which it has been a member since 2017. In 2020, it included in its NFIS for the first time a cross-reference table with the TCFD recommendations. In 2021, Kering took its assessment of the climate risks affecting its business activities to a whole new  level  by  incorporating  scenario-based  analysis,  and  making  preliminary  estimates  of  their  financial  impact.  This double-materiality approach is part of the Group's drive to help combat climate change and enhance its foresight and ability to adapt so that it can mitigate the impact of physical and transition risks on its business (changing consumer expectations, physical risks to its installations, impact on sourcing of its raw materials, etc.).\n\nIn addition to its efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the Group has offset all residual emissions in Scopes 1 and 2 since 2012. In  2019,  it  went  a  step  further  by  committing  to  also  offset  all  residual  emissions  in  Scope  3  (including  supply  chain emissions) through carbon credits with certified REDD+ projects. In 2021, the Group has offset 100% of its overall carbon footprint  (Scopes  1,  2  and  3  calculated  via  the  EP&L  tool  -  excluding  product  use  and  end  of  life)  for  2020.  The  policies, projects  and  actions  implemented,  the  outcomes  achieved  and  the  associated  performance  indicators  relating  to  climate change and the Group's climate strategy are presented in detail in sections 3.2 'Respecting and protecting the environment in our  operations'  and  4.2  'Preserving  natural  capital  across  our  entire  supply  chain'  of  Chapter  4  'Sustainability'  of  this Universal Registration Document.",

To this end, each of Kering's Houses has a crisis management policy and unit that liaises with headquarters.\n\nThe  Group  also  monitors  adherence  by  personnel  to  the  Kering  group  Charter,  which  defines  the  framework  for  the decentralization of the organization, and to the Code of Ethics, which is available in 14 languages and was last circulated to all employees in 2019 after being updated in 2018. A Group Ethics Committee has been established and is supported by two regional counterparts, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) Ethics Committee and the Americas Ethics Committee. Together, they ensure compliance with the Code of Ethics and respond to all inquiries, from simple ethics-related questions to the management of complaints about potential non-compliance with the Code. The Compliance team also assists and guides employees to ensure compliance with prevailing legal requirements, including those relating to corruption and competition law. The three Ethics Committees, the Compliance team and the ethics hotline form Kering's whistleblowing framework. All the Group's employees worldwide, as well as employees of the suppliers and partners under contract with the Group and/or its Houses, may use the whistleblowing system.\n\nEach year, a mandatory Ethics & Compliance e-learning program is provided for all Group employees around the world to remind them about the fundamentals of ethics and their obligations in this regard. It presents real-world examples of ethical dilemmas,  enabling  employees  to  test  their  ability  to  question,  discern  and  judge  different  situations.  It  also  provides  an opportunity to remind employees about the Group's whistleblowing system.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  Group  ensures  that  its  suppliers  adhere  to  the  Group  Suppliers'  Charter,  which  they  are  required  to promote within their production units and among their own subcontractors. Compliance is further measured by means of social audits at production sites. The Charter is included in the Code of Ethics and was therefore also updated and circulated among  suppliers  again  in  2019.  A  further  step  was  taken  in  2020  and  repeated  in  2021  with  the  introduction  of  a communication campaign specifically dedicated to the direct suppliers of the Group, its Houses and their various employees. Available in 15 languages, it is designed to ensure that suppliers' employees are aware of the Group's key commitments and ethical  principles,  enshrined  in  the  Kering  Code  of  Ethics,  as  well  as  of  the  existence  of  the  Kering  whistleblowing  system, which is at their disposal, as well as why, when and how to use it.\n\nAll  of  the  Group's  Houses  implement  appropriate  methods  and  steps  to  ensure  their  activities  comply  with  the  Group's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) standards: SA8000 and RJC certification, social audits and supplier training programs are examples of the actions and programs that the Houses have put in place in their day-to-day operations.\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to ethics  and  global  governance  are  presented  in  detail  in  section  2  'Ethics,  the  cornerstone  of  our  business'  of  Chapter  4 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This assessment  takes  account  of  the  analyses  of  the  insurers underwriting the Group's risks.\n\nThe  insurance  programs  now  in  force  in  the  Group,  which centralize  most  purchases  of  insurance  policies  such  as property  and  casualty  risks  for  subsidiaries,  were  taken  out with  the  assistance  of  internationally  recognized  insurance brokers  specialized  in  covering  major  risks,  with  reputable insurers in the industrial risk insurance sector.\n\nMain existing insurance programs:\n\n- \u00b7 property  damage  from  fire,  explosion,  floods,  machine breakage,  natural  disasters  affecting  its  own  property: property, furnishings, equipment, merchandise, IT installations,  and  property  for  which  it  is  responsible,  as well  as  any  resulting  operating  losses,  for  any  period deemed necessary for normal business activities to resume;\n- \u00b7 damage and loss of equipment, merchandise and/or goods in transit;\n- \u00b7 damage resulting from theft, fraud, embezzlement, or acts of malice to valuable assets, data and/or property;\n- \u00b7 bodily  harm  or  property  damage  following  construction work  carried  out  as  project  owner  (new  buildings, renovations, refurbishments, etc.);\n- \u00b7 liability  for  bodily  or  property  damage  to  third  parties  by motorized vehicles belonging to the different Houses;\n- \u00b7 general  and  environmental  liability  for  'operating  risk',  'postdelivery  risk'  and  'risk  after  services  rendered',  due  to\n\ndamage caused to third parties in the course of the Group's business;\n\n- \u00b7 non-payment  of  receivables by third-party retailers, particularly in the event of default or insolvency;\n- \u00b7 cyberattacks targeting the Group's data and/or other assets.\n\nOther insurance contracts are taken out by Group companies to cover specific risks or to comply with local regulations.\n\nUninsured risks are exposures for which there is no insurance coverage  offered  on  the  insurance  market,  or  for  which  the cost  of  available  insurance  is  disproportionate  compared  to the potential benefits of the coverage.\n\nThe Kering group handles known and manageable risks given the current scientific and medical understanding in a manner consistent  with  other  French  and  international  industrial groups  with  similar  types  of  exposures.  This  is  one  of  the reasons why the Group is able to place its risks with insurers prepared  to  deal  with  the  unforeseeable  and  uncertain consequences of accidents.\n\nInsurance coverage concerns all Group companies.\n\nThe  levels  of  coverage  in  place  for  the  main  potential  risks facing  the  Group  as  a  whole  as  of  January  1,  2021,  were  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 damage, fire, explosions or water damage and the ensuing operating losses: \u20ac300 million increased to \u20ac500 million for the Group's major sites;\n- \u00b7 third party liability: \u20ac145 million;\n- \u00b7 damage to or loss of goods in transit: \u20ac15 million;\n- \u00b7 fraud and acts of malice to goods and valuables: \u20ac15 million.\n\nThe  total  risk  financing  cost  for  Kering  includes  three  main items  (in  addition  to  'physical'  protection  and  prevention expenditure) and breaks down as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 cost of deductibles and non-insured losses retained or selfinsured by the subsidiaries in 2021: \u20ac964,000;\n- \u00b7 claims covered by the Group itself through its reinsurance company  in  2021:  \u20ac931,000  (total  estimated  at  year-end 2021).\n- Self-insurance by the Group's reinsurance  subsidiary reduces insurance costs and enhances performance because (i)  frequently occurring risks are pooled within the Group and insured  for  an  amount  that  is  fixed  per  claim  and  (ii) exceptionally  frequent  claims  made  in  a  given  year  are covered by reinsurance.\n- As  of  July  1,  2021,  the  Group's  reinsurance  company covered damage and operating losses of up to \u20ac3 million per claim, or more on natural events in exposed regions (for the period from July 1 to June 30);\n- \u00b7 insurance  premiums  and  management  fees  including engineering  visits  and  brokers  fees,  etc.  (final  2021 expenses): \u20ac17.8 million.\n\nThere is also a credit insurance budget of around \u20ac1.6 million covering non-payment risks related to sales to retailers (dutyfree chains, department stores, specialized retailers, etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  so  doing,  the  latest  version  of  the  Kering  Code  of Ethics,  released  in  2019,  is  closely  aligned  with  the  major international conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms,  and  sets  forth  the  core  commitments  of  Kering's approach related thereto. In this respect, Kering considers the requirements of the Duty of Care Law to be an integral part of its ethical commitments and undertakes to ensure compliance  with  these  requirements  throughout  both  its operations and its value chain.\n\nIn  2017,  Kering  prepared  a  first  duty  of  care  plan  which included a mapping of the relevant risks. Since its adoption in 2017, Kering has updated its duty of care plan on an annual basis.  In  January  2021,  Kering  performed  a  new  and  more in-depth assessment of the risks covered by the Duty of Care\n\n## 3.2 Risk mapping\n\nAs noted above, the 2021 risk mapping involved a combination of  internal  and  external  resources.  Led  by  the  Group  Chief Compliance Officer on behalf of Kering, the 2021 risk mapping assessed  relevant  risks  within  Kering's  operations  as  well  as those of Gucci and Boucheron. Gucci was selected to represent\n\nKering's Fashion & Leather Goods Division and Italian Houses. It was also chosen because of its expertise and robust activity in the matters relevant to the exercise and in light of its size as  a  House.  Boucheron  was  selected  to  represent  Kering's Watches & Jewelry Division and French Houses.\n\nUnder the Duty of Care Law, the duty of care Plan must include the five following elements:\n\n- 1. a  risk  mapping  that  identifies,  evaluates,  and  ranks relevant risks;\n- 2. due diligence and risk assessment procedures designed to regularly assess, based on the risk mapping, the activities of the company's subsidiaries, suppliers, and subcontractors;\n- 3. appropriate controls designed to mitigate relevant risks and prevent  severe  impact  to  human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms,  severe  harm  to  the  health  and  safety  of individuals, and serious damage to the environment;\n- 4. a reporting channel for the collection of alerts pertaining to  the  existence  of  relevant  risks  or  the  occurrence  of relevant abuses or damages; and\n- 5. a monitoring system designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the controls in place.\n\nLaw  to  see  whether,  and  to  what  extent,  such  risks  have evolved  since  2017.  This  2021  duty  of  care  plan  has  been drafted  in  light  of  the  results  of  that  risk  mapping  ('Duty  of Care Plan').\n\nBoth the performance of the risk mapping and the preparation of  the  Duty  of  Care  Plan  involved  a  significant  number  of internal  stakeholders  (including  from  the  Human  Resources, Sustainability,  Legal,  Compliance,  and  Audit  Departments  of the  Group  and  select  Houses)  and  the  assistance  of  external counsel, which helped to ensure adequate independence and expertise.\n\nKering's  2021  Duty  of  Care  Plan  articulates  around  the  five mandatory components established by the Duty of Care Law, as  summarized  above.  More  generally,  Kering's  Duty  of  Care Plan  presents  an  overview  of  the  actions  that  Kering  has undertaken  over  a  number  of  years  to  act  as  a  responsible company.",

        "page_content": "The  preparation  of  the  2021  risk  mapping  comprised  the following steps:\n\n- 1. identification and categorization of the risks pertaining to the  operations  of  Kering,  Gucci,  and  Boucheron  that  fall within the scope of the Duty of Care Law;\n- 2. interviews with select Kering, Gucci, and Boucheron employees from  the  departments  most  likely  to  have  information\n\n## 3.2.1 Scope\n\nThe  following  risks  were  identified  and  evaluated  as  part  of the 2021 risk mapping:\n\n- 1. Forced Working\n- - Child Labor\n- - Forced  Labor  /  Debt  Bondage  /  Illegal,  Clandestine  or Undeclared  Employment  /  Migrant  Labor  /  Human Trafficking\n- 2. Discrimination and Harassment\n- - Diversity\n- - Discrimination\n- - Women's Rights\n- - Psychological or Sexual Harassment / Violence\n- 3. Absence of Dialogue\n- - Freedom of Association / Right to Collective Bargaining\n- 4. Decent Working Conditions\n- - Right to a Living Wage / Fair Wages\n- - Working Hours\n- - Dignity at Work / Mental Well-Being\n\n## 3.2.2 Methodology\n\nThe risks listed above were assessed separately with respect to (i) Kering's,  Gucci's,  and  Boucheron's  internal  operations, (ii)  the  operations  of  their  first  level  suppliers,  and  (iii)  the sourcing of raw materials. This risk mapping evaluated gross risk  and  calculated net risk via the  evaluation and scoring of relevant controls in place.\n\nFirst, gross risks related to internal operations were assessed separately  per  country  based  on  a  combination  of  objective factors (the number of employees, production sites, warehouses, and stores located in each country of operations) and three country and risk-specific third party indices (varying for  each  risk  and  including  among  many  others  the  Human Freedom  Index,  ITUC  Global  Rights  Index,  the  Environmental Performance Index and the Animal Protection Index) allowing for an assessment of the potential impact and the likelihood of occurrence.\n\nSecond,  gross  risks  related  to  the  operations  of  first  level suppliers were assessed based on the number of suppliers per country  and  the  respective  turnover  for  Kering,  Gucci  and Boucheron,  which  were  once  again  combined  with  three country and risk-specific indices.\n\nFinally,  gross  risks  related  to  the  sourcing  of  raw  materials were assessed on the aggregate percentage of select high risk raw materials sourced by Kering, Gucci, and Boucheron from\n\nrelevant  to  such  risks  (including  Internal  Audit,  Human Resources,  Indirect  Procurement,  Security,  Supply  Chain Audit, Supply Chain Security and Sustainability);\n\n- 3. review of relevant documents; and\n- 4. assessment of each risk.\n- 5. Occupational Health and Safety\n- - Safe and Hygienic Working Conditions\n- - Chemicals / Hazardous Substances\n- 6. Pollution\n- - Energy Use\n- - Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change\n- 7. Waste & Packaging\n- - Waste and Packaging\n- 8. Water Use\n- - Water Consumption\n- - Wastewater Treatment\n- 9. Animals & Biodiversity Abuse\n- - Animal Protection\n- - Preservation of Biodiversity\n- 10. Local Communities Abuses\n- - Land  Rights  /  Forced  Eviction  and  Displacement  of Populations\n- - Cultural Heritage / Local Communities\n\na  given  country  and  six  general  country-specific  indices. The  assessment  also  took  into  account  two  magnifying factors, i.e. , the  inclusion  of  the  country  (i)  in  the  U.S. Department  of  Labor  lists  of  countries  producing  goods and products that are believed to be produced by child labor and/or forced labor, and/or (ii) in the list of conflict-affected and high-risk countries under E.U. Regulation No. 2017/821.\n\nThe  respective  net  risks  of  the  above  three  categories  were then  obtained via the  evaluation  and  scoring  of  relevant controls in place.\n\nIt should be noted that a distinction was made, to accurately identify  risks,  between  the  risks  to  which  Kering,  Gucci,  and Boucheron expose their stakeholders (as required by the Duty of  Care  Law)  and  the  risks  to  which  Kering,  Gucci,  and Boucheron are exposed because of their activities (for inclusion in  the  Group's  general  risk  mapping).  More  specifically,  the assessment of the gross risks for Kering, Gucci and Boucheron also  took  into  account  the  potential  reputational,  financial and legal/compliance impact.\n\nOverall,  the  2021  risk  mapping  entailed  interviews  with 37  Group  employees,  a  review  of  over  400  documents,  and the  scoring  of  thousands  of  country-specific  risks  through 47 general and risk-specific third party indices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Relevant  risks  are  further  mitigated by  multiple  controls  and  primarily  by  the  implementation  of\n\nthe  Hercules  management  system  (described  below),  which covers  the  onboarding  of  suppliers  and  their  subcontractors as well as the monitoring of their performance throughout the entire contractual relationship.\n\nThe  controls  in  place  to  limit  relevant  risks  within  the remainder of the supply chain, including with respect to the sourcing and traceability of raw material, consist primarily in the  implementation  of  the  requirements  set  forth  by  the Sustainability  Principles  and  the  Kering  Standards  for  Raw Materials  and  Processes,  as  well  as  in  the  certifications obtained by suppliers.\n\n## 3.3 Regular assessments of the activities of subsidiaries, suppliers and subcontractors\n\n## 3.3.1 Subsidiaries and Other Controlled Entities\n\nSince  2018,  Kering  has  refocused  its  operations  on  Luxury,  and more  particularly  around  the  Couture  &  Leather  Goods  and Watches  &  Jewelry  Divisions.  In  2021,  Kering  comprised  13 Houses.\n\n## 3.3.1.1 Stores\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  Kering's  Houses  directly  operated 1,565  stores worldwide.  As  part  of  its  Sustainability  targets, in  2020,  Kering  adopted  dedicated  standards  that  cover  the commercial life of its stores. These standards provide specific guidance  for  achieving  environmental  efficiency  during  both the store planning and construction phase as well as the store operation  and  management  phase.  These  standards  also provide for the performance of periodic audits to ensure that relevant practices are duly respected, including with respect to energy and water use, as well as waste collection practices.\n\nMoreover, as with all other Group premises, stores are subject to  regular  audits  by  the  Group  Internal  Audit  Department  to ensure compliance with local regulations regarding\n\n## 3.3.2 Suppliers and Subcontractors\n\nKering  works  with  several  thousand  suppliers  to  produce  its Houses'  collections.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Group Hercules  supplier  database  (described  below)  comprised  a total of 4,107 active suppliers throughout the Group. The chart below  describes  the  geographical  breakdown  of  these suppliers.\n\nThe  Hercules  compliance  management  system,  introduced in  2015,  aims  to  create  and  share  best  practices  in  risk assessment  and  provide  supply  chain  analysis  for  Kering's production processes. This is achieved through the following tools:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupplier Management Procedures. The Houses apply a set of consistent procedures for managing interactions with suppliers, including  with  respect  to  their  qualification, assessment,  and  relationship  management.  Kering  has  also introduced a template contract that incorporates its Code of Ethics (including the Suppliers' Charter) and its Sustainability Principles.  Both  documents  are  systematically  issued  to suppliers  and  form  an  integral  part  of  the  contractual relationship with Kering. These documents further require that the commitments established therein be cascaded to relevant sub-suppliers and subcontractors.\n\ngovernance, human rights and environmental protection and Kering's  policies  and  procedures.  As  noted  above,  these include a review of relevant working conditions, including the processes used to track working hours and employee leave as well  as  the  measures  in  place  to  ensure  that  the  privacy  of employees are fully respected.\n\n## 3.3.1.2 Offices and Other Premises\n\nOffices  and  other  premises  owned  by  Kering  and  its  Houses, including  production  sites  and  warehouses,  are  subject  to regular  audits  by  the  Group  Internal  Audit  Department  to ensure  that  applicable  regulations  are  fully  respected  and internal  policies  and  procedures  are  fully  implemented.  In addition to more generalized testing of controls, these audits assess the working conditions of employees by ensuring, for example, that employment relationships are always formalized  by  dedicated  agreements  (in  particular  with respect to temporary workers) and that salaries and working hours are properly managed and documented.",

        "page_content": "Integrity  Due  Diligence  Procedure . Kering  subjects  third party  suppliers  and  service  providers  to  the  integrity  due diligence  process  set  forth  in  the  Group's  Anti-Corruption Policy and  Third  Party  Due  Diligence  Procedure.  More specifically,  to  properly  assess  and  manage  the  financial, regulatory, and  reputational risks associated with the relationships  with  these  third  parties,  Kering  screens  them through  the  World-Check  database  and  conducts  dedicated desktop searches. Depending on the risk profile, Kering might also  require  the  completion  of  a  dedicated  questionnaire  or the  performance  of  an  external  review  from  an  independent law firm.\n\nSocial and Safety Audits. The  Group  conducts regular social and  safety  audits  to  assess  and  monitor  the  Group's  supply chain operations. These audits are performed by a dedicated team,  the  Kering  Supply  Chain  Audit  Department,  which reports to the Group's Chief Audit Executive, which ensures the independence  and  impartiality  of  its  members.  Since  the inception of this tool, the Group has fine-tuned and clarified the standards governing these audits. As further discussed in Section V. below, the audits cover social (including child labor, forced or compulsory  labor, and working conditions), environmental  (including  greenhouse  air  emissions,  waste management, plastic use and recycling practices), and health and  safety  risks  pertaining  to  the  operations  of  the  Group's and  the  Houses'  first  level  suppliers,  first  and  second  level\n\n## 3.4 Control measures\n\nAs noted  above,  Kering  and  the  Houses  are  strongly committed to fully complying with the requirements set forth by the Duty of Care Law and to fostering a significant number of initiatives aimed at respecting human rights and protecting the  environment  throughout  their  operations  and  the  value chain.  In  this  respect,  Kering  works  in  close  synergy  with  its\n\nHouses  to  ensure  that  relevant  controls  are  adequately deployed  throughout  the  entire  Group.  Some  Houses, including Gucci, have been particularly proactive in improving their sustainability performance through the implementation of  reinforced  controls  both  internally  and vis-\u00e0-vis external stakeholders.\n\n## 3.4.1 Key Internal Stakeholders\n\nKering takes a cross-functional approach to governance over human  rights  challenges.  Specifically,  day-to-day  human rights  governance  spans  various  departments  at  Kering  and House levels.\n\nKering  Compliance  Department . The  Group  Compliance Department  is  primarily  responsible  for  monitoring  the effective implementation of the commitments established by the Kering  Human  Rights  Policy.  As  such,  the  Group Compliance Department  is kept informed of relevant initiatives and coordinates the efforts undertaken by relevant departments at the Group and House level (including through information sharing). The Group Compliance Department also tests and assesses existing processes to map risks throughout the  Group,  and  supports  the  Houses  and  relevant  Kering departments  in  assessing  risks  associated  with  their  day-today  operations.  At  House-level,  the  Compliance  departments provide day-to-day support in connection with the operations of each House.\n\nKering  Sustainability  Department .  The  Group  Sustainability Department  is  responsible  for  defining  and  implementing the Group's sustainability strategy and policies and supporting the Houses with respect to their implementation. The Kering Sustainability Department is composed of around 35 specialists who report to the Chief Sustainability and Institutional Affairs Officer,  who  is  both  a  member  of  the  Group's  Executive Committee  and  the  Chairwoman  of  the  Group's  Ethics Committee. Overall, the Sustainability function employs more than  90  individuals  throughout  the  Group,  working  for  the Kering  Sustainability  Department,  the  Houses'  Sustainability teams,  as  well  as  dedicated  structures  such  as  the  Materials Innovation Lab and the Sustainable Innovation Lab.\n\nsubcontractors, and direct suppliers of raw materials accounting  for  80%  of  the  category's  turnover.  All  new suppliers must be audited as a prerequisite for qualification. Regular audits are also conducted throughout the relationship with the supplier. In particular, while key suppliers are subject to audits every two years, the frequency of the audits on other suppliers is determined through dedicated risk mappings. If a 'zero  tolerance'  issue  is  identified  as  part  of  these  audits (including, e.g. ,  forced  labor  or  undeclared  sub-contracting), Kering  may  refuse  to  enter  into  the  agreement  with  a proposed  supplier  or  terminate  the  relationship  with  an existing  supplier.  Findings  from  the  audits  performed  by  the Kering  Supply  Chain  Audit  Department  are  discussed  in dedicated committees composed of representatives from key functions from both the Group and the Houses.\n\nSupplier  Database. All  Kering's  Houses  have  access  to  a common supplier database, which includes, inter alia , findings from  past  suppliers'  audits  as  well  as  supplier  information available  from  publicly  available  databases.  At  the  end  of 2021, this database comprised 4,107 active suppliers. In 2021, the  Supply  Chain  Audit  Department  performed  3,420  audits on these suppliers. While this database does not yet include all  Group  suppliers,  it  does  include  all  production  suppliers, the main suppliers of raw materials, Kering Eyewear suppliers, strategic  suppliers,  as  well  as  select  suppliers  of  the  watch businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Human Resources Department  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the controls  ensuring  the  respect  of  human  rights  within  the Group, throughout the entire employee journey, including the recruitment process and the working conditions of employees. A  dedicated  Inclusion  and  Diversity  team  within  the  Human Resources  function  works  with  the  Group  Houses  to  define and  prioritize  the  initiatives  that  foster  an  inclusive  working environment  at  all  levels  of  the  organization.  In  2020, Inclusion & Diversity Committees were created in each House and at the Corporate level, led by a member of the House or of the  Corporate  Management  Committee.  The  Inclusion  and Diversity  team  currently  comprises  more  than  100  members across the Group.\n\nKering  Internal  Audit  Department .  As  further  discussed  in Section 1 of this chapter, the Group Internal Audit Department assesses  the  implementation  of  the  Kering  internal  controls system  within  the  Group's  internal  operations  through  the performance of regular audits performed in accordance with the Group's annual audit plan.\n\n## 3.4.2 Key Policies and Procedures\n\nKering's subsidiaries, suppliers, and  subcontractors  are required  to  strictly  abide  by  local  legislation  and  to  comply with  the  policies  and  procedures  summarized  below.  Should these  policies  and  procedures  set  forth  more  stringent standards  than  those  established  by  local  legislation,  such standards must take precedence.\n\nCode of Ethics .  As noted above, the Code of Ethics forms the cornerstone  of  Kering's  ethical  commitments  and,  as  such, includes the Group's engagements in upholding human rights, fundamental freedoms, health and safety and the environment.  It  also  requires  its  suppliers  to  adhere  to  the same  commitments,  notably via its annexed  Suppliers' Charter,  which  sets  out  Kering's  expectations vis-\u00e0-vis its suppliers. Compliance  with  the  Charter  constitutes  an essential  condition  of  the  commercial  relationship  between the Group or the Houses and their suppliers, which are in turn required to extend these requirements to their own suppliers and subcontractors. Following the 2018 update to the Code of Ethics, the document was reissued to all employees worldwide in  2019.  This  update  reaffirmed  Kering's  commitment  to apply all major international conventions to its activities and to  strengthen  and  clarify  its  requirements  towards  suppliers. For example, the Suppliers' Charter now  includes a requirement to pay special attention to certain categories of workers, such as migrants, who are vulnerable to exploitation. The  Code  of  Ethics  and  the  Suppliers'  Charter  have  been translated  into  the  14  most  widely  spoken  languages  within the Group.\n\nHuman Rights Policy .  The  Human  Rights  Policy,  published  in 2021, defines the Group's commitments on human rights and fundamental  freedoms,  health  and  safety,  and  environmental protection.  The  Human  Rights  Policy  further  outlines  the Group's policies related thereto and defines the means by which the  Group  and  its  business  partners,  including  suppliers  and contractors, can ensure the fulfillment of these commitments.\n\nSustainability Principles . The Sustainability Principles, created in 2015 and updated in 2021, are applicable across all Houses and cover three main areas: social aspects regarding\n\nKering  Security  Department . The  Security  Department  is responsible  for, inter  alia ,  the  implementation  of  the  safety measures  set  forth  in  the  Kering  Global  Health  and  Safety Policy  and  for  ensuring  compliance  with  applicable  safety regulations.\n\nKering Supply Chain Audit Department .  As noted above, the Kering Supply Chain Audit Department conducts regular social and  safety  audits  to  assess  and  monitor  the  Group's  supply chain operations.\n\nProduct Compliance Department . The Kering Product Compliance Department assists the Houses to test substances in products, including  through  a  dedicated  testing  center  that  the  Group recently opened in Florence.\n\nHouse  Teams . Every  House  of  the  Group  has  dedicated Compliance,  Sustainability,  and  Human  Resources  teams responsible for ensuring that the controls established by the Kering  policies  and  procedures  described  below  are  properly deployed throughout their operations.\n\nhuman rights,  environmental  aspects,  and  aspects  regarding the  sourcing  of  raw  materials  and  packaging.  Suppliers  are required to abide by these principles and supplier compliance is  evaluated  on  this  basis.  The  principles  are  outlined  in  the section  4.1.3.1  of  Chapter  4  'Sustainability'  of  this  Universal Registration  Document  'Implementation  of  the  social  audit system within the Group' and on the Group's website.\n\nKering  Standards  for  Raw  Materials  and  Manufacturing Processes . In the pursuit of its commitment and approach to human  and  environmental  concerns,  Kering  has  published dedicated standards on raw material sourcing, manufacturing processes, and animal welfare. The key factors covered by the Kering Standards include (i) environmental impact, (ii) working conditions and  human  rights  in  the  production,  and (iii) extraction  processes  of  the  key  raw  materials  used throughout the Group, whether mined, otherwise extracted or of  plant  or  animal  origin.  The  principles  that  underpin  the Kering Standards are integrity, circularity, and the application of the principle of precaution. Under its 2025 strategy, Kering is  committed  to  seeing  that  all  its  suppliers  apply  these standards  by  2025.  A  detailed  description  of  the  Kering Standards is given in section 4.1.1 of the Sustainability chapter.\n\nKering  Animal  Welfare  Standards .  In  May  2019,  the  Group published  the  Animal  Welfare  Standards  with  the  aim  of ensuring  the  best  treatment  for  animals  throughout  the supply  chain.  The  Kering  Animal  Welfare  Standards  are  the first  ever  set  of  full  standards  for  the  luxury  and  fashion sectors and aim to drive positive change in industry practices and beyond. They cover all the species in the Group's supply chains  around  the  world,  notably  cattle  and  calves,  sheep, goats,  ostriches,  crocodiles  and  alligators  and  pythons.  For each  of  these  species,  the  open-source  Standards  highlight the specific challenges, laying down breeding, transportation, and slaughtering requirements, and provide the list of existing benchmark  certifications.  In  addition  to  this  multi-species document,  Kering  has  published  more  detailed  individual Standards  for  cattle,  calves,  sheep  and  goats  as  well  as guidelines for slaughterhouses.",

        "page_content": "Environmental Policy . Kering's Environmental Policy contributes to the fulfillment of the Care pillar of Kering's 2025 sustainability strategy.  It  spans  the  entire  supply  chain,  focusing  on  the three  following  objectives:  (i)  reduce  Kering's  Environmental Profit and Loss account ('EP&L') by 40% with respect to 2015; (ii)  achieve  100%  compliance  with  the  Kering  Standards;  and (iii) ensure 100% traceability for the Group's main raw materials.\n\nClimate Strategy .  Kering  firmly  believes  that  companies  can play  a  decisive  role  in  the  fight  against  climate  change,  and has  drawn  up  in  2021  a  holistic  strategy  with  a  clear commitment to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, underlining its ambitions in sustainability,  circularity  and  biodiversity.  Key  highlights  of Kering's Climate Strategy include: (i) reaching a 90% absolute reduction of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from a 2015 baseline; (ii) reducing 70% (per unit value added) of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030; (iii) increasing direct sourcing of renewable electricity to reach 100% by 2022; and  (iv)  strategic  and  appropriate  offsetting  through  Natural Climate  Solutions  ('NCS')  for  'hard  to  abate'  emissions.  More information  on  Kering's  Climate  strategy  can  be  found  in section 3.2.1 of the Sustainability chapter.\n\nBiodiversity  Strategy . The  Biodiversity  Strategy,  published in  2020,  explains  Kering's  approach  on  preserving  natural resources.  This  approach  is  structured  around  four  phases (avoidance, reduction, restoration/regeneration and transformation) and has three main goals: (i) to stem the loss of biodiversity, (ii) to re-build ecosystems and rehabilitate species, and (iii) to drive  systemic  change  throughout  the  supply  chain  and beyond. More information on Kering's biodiversity strategy can be found in section 3.2.1 of the Sustainability chapter.\n\nFashion  Models  Charter . The  Charter  on  the  Working Relations  with  Fashion  Models  and  their  Well-Being  was introduced  in  September  2017  to  ensure  that  Kering  and  its Houses  comply  with  various  major  principles,  including requiring models  to  present  valid  medical  certificates attesting to their good health, discontinuing the modeling of size 32 clothes for women and size 42 for men, and improving working conditions ( e.g. ,  providing a dedicated changing area as  well  as  food  and  drinks).  In  2019,  in  furtherance  of  this Charter, Kering and its Houses committed to only hire models aged  18  and  over  to  represent  adults  at  fashion  shows  and photo shoots as of 2020.\n\nHealth  &  Safety  Policy . Kering's  Health  &  Safety  Policy addresses its own employees, service providers, and visitors to Group  sites,  so  as  to  promote  best  practices,  assert  the Group's  commitment  to  an  environment  conducive  to employee  health  and  safety,  and  undertake  ambitious measures in this respect. This policy is founded on Group-wide best practices and aims to ensure that governance, processes, and  regular  internal  audits  are  in  place  to  achieve  Kering's target of zero accidents.\n\nCompliance  Manual . The  Compliance  Manual,  which  was issued Group-wide in 2018, sets out practical examples on the main  ethics  risks associated with Kering's operations, including with respect to human rights violations. The Manual outlines  the  basic  concepts  and  legal  challenges  involved and gives practical examples enabling employees to pinpoint areas requiring vigilance in their day-to-day work.\n\n## 3.4.3 Risk Prevention and Mitigation Measures in the Internal Operations\n\nRaising Employee Awareness. Kering seeks to ensure that its employees throughout the Group are fully acquainted with its policies  and  procedures  (including  with  respect  to  human rights,  sustainability  and  environmental  protection)  through regular  training,  internal  communications,  and  Group-wide events.  The  training  offer  includes:  (i)  the  annual  Ethics  and Compliance  e-learning, with training modules  covering different ethics, compliance and sustainability-related topics, mandatory  for  all  Group  employees.  In  2021,  the  training curriculum focused on cultural differences, invisible disability at work,  resale  of  luxury  items,  compliance  and  anticorruption,  as  well  as  biodiversity  and  animal  welfare.  This training  also  allowed  to  raise  awareness  on  the  newly published Human Rights Policy; and (ii) the Kering Standards e-learning,  available  to  employees  since  2019  to  better understand Kering's strategy to reduce its environmental and social  impacts  due  to  raw  materials  and  manufacturing processes. Kering and its Houses also share their commitment towards sustainability through the company social networks, and leverage them to create and communicate on Group-wide events  celebrating  recognized  initiatives,  such  as  the  World\n\nEnvironment  Day  and  raises  awareness  on  environmental issues.  They  also  created  a  dedicated  digital  platform,  called Kering Planet, which includes interactive tools such as quizzes and contests on the subject matter.\n\nSustainability  Certifications. In  furtherance  of  the  Group's commitment  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  highest  social and  environmental  standards,  multiple  entities  and  sites owned by Kering  and  its  Houses  have  obtained  a  significant number  of  sustainability  certifications.  These  include  the SA8000  (covering  working  conditions  and  social  standards), ISO  14001  (covering  environmental  performance),  ISO  45001 (covering  health  and  safety),  ISO  9001  (covering  compliance with applicable statutory and  regulatory  requirements), ISO  28000  (covering  security  within  the  supply  chain), and  ISO  22301  (covering  Business  continuity  management systems) standards. Certifications related to the implementation  of  environmental  management  systems are sought primarily for the sites that have a more significant environmental impact, such as large logistics centers and  tanneries.  All  of  the  Group's  tanneries  have  been ISO 14001 certified since 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering and its Houses reject all  forms  of  child  labor,  forced  labor,  and  human  trafficking. The Group has put into place recruitment processes designed to ensure the respect of relevant legal requirements (including with  respect  to  the  employment  age)  and  the  prevention  of human rights abuses. To that end, employees from the Human Resources function received specific trainings to ensure that such processes are fully implemented.\n\nPromoting Diversity and Preventing Discrimination. Kering believes that diversity is a source of creativity and innovation and  seeks  to  develop  an  inclusive  approach  to  ensure  that everyone is given the opportunity to be themselves. Kering is also committed to fostering a culture of equality at all levels of the Group and offering its employees an open and stimulating working  environment,  free  from  any  discrimination.  Kering launched in January 2020 the Baby Leave policy, entitling all employees  worldwide  to  14  weeks'  leave  on  full  pay  upon becoming  parents,  including  fathers  and  partners.  The  Baby Leave  policy  aims  to  promote  a  better  balance  between employees'  professional  and  personal  lives  and  to  achieve equality  between  female  and  male  employees  -  regardless of  their  personal  circumstances  -  guaranteeing  all  Group employees  worldwide  the  same  minimum  benefits  on  the arrival of a child. Since 2019, the Inclusion and Diversity team has been instrumental in the adoption of initiatives to foster a culture  of  diversity  and  inclusion  throughout  the  Group. Among  others,  this  team  has  (i)  supported  the  creation  of Inclusion and Diversity Committees in each House, (ii) developed  and  delivered  a  comprehensive  Inclusive Recruitment  training,  for  recruiters  from  all  Houses,  and (iii) developed several initiatives to raise awareness, encourage meaningful  conversation,  and  bring  positive  change.  Such initiatives  included  the  Inspiring  Speakers'  series,  the  D&I Glossary  and  dedicated  communication  campaigns  ( e.g. ,  the International Women's Day and Pride Month).\n\nEmpowering  Women. Empowering  women  is  a  priority  at Kering, which  seeks  to  ensure  that  women  are  well represented at all levels of management in the Group. In 2010, Kering  was  one  of  the  first  signatories  of  the  Women's Empowerment Principles Charter drawn up by UN Women and the  UN  Global  Compact.  Kering  and  its  Houses  develop women's skills through specific programs, such as mentoring sessions, coaching, and leadership training, to support women talents  and  enhance  gender  diversity  in  senior  management positions.  Kering  is  closely  monitoring  the  representation  of women  in  top  executive  positions  and  is  committed  to achieving gender pay equity at every level of the organization by 2025.\n\nFree  from  Harassment. Kering  endeavors  to  provide  a working  environment  free  from  any  form  of  harassment  or violence.  As  such,  Kering  and  its  Houses  encourage  all employees to report any instances of such behavior, which is subject  to  disciplinary  sanctions  and,  in  many  countries, criminal  proceedings.  Kering  ensures  that  its  employees  are fully versed on their rights in the matter, including by having\n\nprovided  a  module  on  discrimination  and  harassment  in  its 2020 Ethics & Compliance training. In an effort to extend its commitment  externally,  Kering  also  supports  victims  of domestic  violence via its  2021  Policy  on  Domestic  Violence and the work of the Kering Foundation.\n\nIncreased Dialogue with Employees. Kering is fully committed to guaranteeing applicable trade union rights and to  engaging  in  a  constant  and  productive  dialogue  with  its employees  worldwide,  including  with  those  located  in countries  that  do  not  allow  collective  bargaining.  Kering performs  a  biannual  employee  survey  to  collect  employees' feedback on their working environment, in a confidential and secure  way.  Based  on  feedback  received,  Kering  develops  a Group  action  plan  that  is  adapted  at  each  House  and  local level. Kering also conducts local actions to increase awareness and foster the adoption of well-being policies. For example, in January 2021, Kering conducted a survey in the APAC region to understand how to increase Baby Leave adoption.\n\nDecent Working Conditions. Kering  and  the  Houses  seek  to ensure that the work of employees is adequately remunerated and conducted in compliance with local legislation, including with  respect  to  working  hours.  As  such,  the  Group  partnered with Fair Wage Network to conduct a study to evaluate if the base salary of the Group's employees allows for an adequate standard of living in the key countries where Kering operates. Kering  has  also  adopted  a  number  of  initiatives  designed  to ensure the mental well-being of employees, including during the COVID-19  pandemic.  Such  initiatives include free, voluntary  external  psychological  support  services,  increased remote  working,  wellness  days  and  workshops  designed  to provide  managers  with  tools  to  maintain  cohesion  and efficient teamwork despite the pandemic.\n\nSupporting Local Communities. Kering plays a role in the life of  the  communities where its sites are located and works to prevent and mitigate any negative impacts that its operations create  or  to  which  they  contribute.  In  this  respect,  Kering  is actively  engaged  in  supporting  the  continuation  of  artisan traditions and  the  communities  that  support  artisans, including the trade of leatherwork in Italy, watchmaking in the Jura  Valley,  and  artistic  creation  in  Milan,  Paris,  and  London. These  efforts  are  also  cascaded  throughout  the  Houses,  as evidenced by Gucci's efforts. In 2019, Gucci implemented the Gucci  Changemakers  Program,  a  global  initiative  that  allows Gucci employees worldwide to dedicate up to four paid days of leave  a  year  to  make  a  positive  impact  on  local communities  through  volunteering.  Gucci  also  launched  the Design  Fellowship  Program,  a  partnership  with  10  fashion schools around the world that aims to provide opportunities for underrepresented groups and global communities to gain professional  experience  and  exposure  to  luxury  fashion design. Kering also launched the Giving Back program to meet the  needs  expressed  by  employees  for  a  strong  sense  of purpose.  The  program  gives  the  employees  of  participating Houses  the  opportunity  to  support  selected  and  validated local good  causes  through  21  paid  working  hours  of volunteering  per  year.  Launched  in  France  and  Italy  in  2021, the program will be implemented in the UK in 2022, and then extended to additional countries.",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.3.2 Key Control Measures Designed to Prevent Severe Harm to the Health and Safety of Individuals\n\nSafe and Hygienic Working Conditions. Kering is committed to  the  principle  of  risk  prevention  and  seeks  to  ensure  the occupational health and safety of its employees by complying with  all  applicable  regulations  and  by  establishing  relevant best practices. The Kering Security Department is responsible for  managing  the  security  of  Group  sites,  preparing  relevant emergency plans, and delivering safety trainings to employees. As  noted  above,  Gucci  has  also  obtained  the  ISO  45001 certification  related  to  the  occupational  health  and  safety management  systems  aiming  at  reducing  occupational injuries and diseases, and promoting and protecting physical and  mental  health.  Kering  and  the  Houses  have  also undertaken multiple initiatives designed to ensure the health and  safety  of  employees  during  the  pandemic,  including complying  with  all  relevant  regulations,  increased  remote working,  and  offering  free  testing  for  employees  in  certain locations.\n\nMinimizing Chemicals / Hazardous Substances. Kering works constantly  to  curb  the  use  of  chemicals  and  hazardous substances  from  all  its  Houses'  products  and  production processes. For this purpose, the Group has created two lists of restricted substances: one for production processes, the Manufacturing Restricted Substance List ('MRSL'), and one for  products,  the  Product  Restricted  Substance  List  ('PRSL'). The  MRSL  is  focused  on  discontinuing  the  use  of  dangerous chemicals  in  manufacturing  processes  to  both  avoid  the exposure of employees to hazardous substances, and reduce toxic  discharges  into  water.  The  main  source  of  the  Group's hazardous waste production is related to the operations of its tanneries.  As  such,  the  Group  is  actively  involved  in  the research and development of environmental-friendly tanning processes,  and  has  introduced  a  heavy  metal-free  tanning method in leather tanneries.\n\n## 3.4.3.3 Key Control Measures Designed to Prevent Serious Environmental Damages\n\nEnvironmental Profit & Loss Account. Since 2012, Kering has measured  and  quantified  its  progress  toward  becoming  a more sustainable Group through its EP&L. The EP&L allows the company  to  measure  its  impacts  on  natural  capital throughout  its  value  chain  and  assign  a  monetary  value  to them. The EP&L is the cornerstone of the Group's environmental approach and it also serves as a management tool by which Kering lays out its roadmap for the coming years in  terms  of  sourcing  strategy  and  choice  of  materials.  The Group has indeed undertaken to reduce its EP&L intensity by 40%  by  2025  compared  with  2015.  In  line  with  its commitment to transparency, the Group's EP&L results and an analysis  of  progress  made  have  been  shared via the  open source platform kering-group.opendatasoft.com.\n\nReducing  Carbon  Emissions. The  Group  has  set  very ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint by 2030. As part of the Fashion Pact, Kering and over 250 global fashion brands  committed  to  take  action  to  halt  climate  change, restore biodiversity and protect the oceans. The participating\n\ncompanies have notably pledged to take action to achieve the objective  of  net-zero  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  2050, in  order  to  keep  global  warming  below  1.5\u00b0C  between  now and 2100. As part of these commitments, Kering continues to offset  its  residual  Scope  1  and  2  greenhouse  gas  emissions. Kering  also  continues  its  strategic  and  voluntary  offsetting program  covering  for  2021  its  full  Scope  1,  2,  3  greenhouse gas emissions released in 2020 amounting to 1,779,888 tCO2. Carbon  credits  have  been  obtained  through  the  provision  of support for several REDD+  (Reducing  Emissions  from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programs, with Verified Carbon  Standard  ('VCS')  certification.  Not  only  does  this generate  carbon  credits,  it  also  provides  substantial  support for local populations and the protection of biodiversity.\n\nFavoring  Renewable  Energies. In  2020,  Kering  joined  the RE100  initiative,  led  by  the  Climate  Group  and  the  Carbon Disclosure Project. As part of this initiative, Kering has pledged to use 100% renewable electricity by 2022. The proportion of renewable electricity used within the Group amounted to 92% in 2021 as compared to 66% in 2018. Kering also encourages entering into agreements to purchase locally produced green electricity. Where this is not possible, Kering purchases Energy Attribute Certificates. On top of external purchases, the Houses continue  to  increase  their  reliance  on  renewable  energy,  for example by installing solar panels.\n\nMonitoring Energy Use. While constantly seeking to optimize the energy efficiency of its sites, Kering has implemented an energy  consumption  monitoring  system  which  allows  the Houses to access monthly consumption data for their sites on an  IT  platform.  The  system  also  allows  to  streamline  the energy  procurement  process  by  pooling  and  consolidating energy  consumption,  increase  the  use  of  renewable  energy, and centralize energy procurement management.\n\nWaste  Treatment. Kering  and  its  Houses  have  created dedicated partnerships to find sustainable solutions for waste recycling, in an effort to combat and minimize the production of waste generated by the intensity of the Group's operations, particularly in the retail sector. In addition, as the main source of  the  Group's  hazardous  waste  production  occurs  in  its tanneries,  each  tannery  has  its  own  onsite  wastewater treatment plant, which pretreats all wastewater.\n\nMore  Sustainable  Packaging. Kering  and  its  Houses  make every effort to opt for the most sustainable solutions available made  from  recycled  or  certified  biosourced  materials.  They also carry out initiatives to reduce the use of packaging while maintaining  an  optimal  level  of  protection  for  the  goods manufactured.  In  2020,  Kering  developed  a  new  packaging standard setting out the eco-design principles to improve its environmental  impact  of  packaging  materials.  In  the  same vein, Kering has pledged to eliminate single-use plastics from its B2C and B2B packaging by 2025 and 2030, respectively.\n\nReducing  Water  Consumption. Kering  seeks  to  reduce  the consumption  of  water  in  its  operations,  and  has  identified that  65%  of  water  consumed  across  the  Group  is  used  for domestic  purposes  and  35%  for  industrial  purposes.  The Group's industrial water consumption is primarily attributable to  its  tanneries,  none  of  which  is  located  in  water-stressed zones.  However,  the  Houses  have  continued  to  work  to identify  innovative  tanning  processes  that  eliminate  heavy metals and use less water.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nProtecting  Biodiversity. Kering  is  committed  to  preserving biodiversity through several conservation programs. As noted above,  in  2020,  the  Group  developed  a  biodiversity  strategy, which  aims  to  stem  the  loss  of  biodiversity,  re-build ecosystems,  and  rehabilitate  species  as  well  as  to  drive systemic  change  throughout  the  supply  chain  and  beyond. As  part  of  its  commitment,  Kering  will  protect  one  million hectares of essential and irreplaceable habitats outside of its supply chain by 2025, primarily through programs that will be beneficial  on  multiple  levels  in  terms  of  biodiversity  protection,\n\ncarbon  sequestration  and  improved  livelihoods  for  local people. Kering has also created the Kering Regenerative Fund for  Nature  to  steer  its  action  programs  and  achieve  a  net positive impact by 2025. At House level, in 2020, Gucci joined the  Lion's  Share  funds,  an  initiative  designed  to  support animal  welfare  and  conservation  projects  by  donating  a percentage  of  its  media  spend  on  advertisements  featuring animals.  Gucci  also  partnered  with  ForestaMI  to  safeguard forests in Lombardy.\n\n## 3.4.4 Risk Prevention and Mitigation Measures in Supply Chain Operations\n\nRaising  the  Awareness  of  Suppliers. Kering  and  its  Houses provide  suppliers  with  multiple  awareness-raising  initiatives which  aim  at  providing  them  with  tools  to  enable  them  to comply with the highest social and environmental standards. For  instance,  the  Kering  Materials  Innovation  Lab  has  daily interactions  with  ready-to-wear  and  accessories  suppliers  to promote  compliance  with  the  Kering  Standards  for  Raw Materials  and  Processes.  In  the  same  vein,  in  2019,  Gucci organized a number of meetings with its suppliers to share its sustainability strategy, the Kering Standards, and the flagship projects  implemented  within  its  supply  chains.  Relevant workshops  covered, inter  alia ,  FSC  materials,  animal  welfare, and traceability. In 2020, Gucci also launched the Gucci Supply Chain  Academy,  a  customized  training  program  that  focuses on the various key skills required in the supply chain function, to  standardize  and  share  knowledge  across  all  teams  and enable them to anticipate market trends and respond to the commercial challenges ahead.\n\nSustainability  Certifications. Multiple  Kering  and  House suppliers have obtained third party sustainability certifications covering, inter  alia , environmental  and  social  standards. Kering constantly compares the standards underpinning these certifications  with  those  established  by  its  Sustainability Principles and Standards for Raw Materials and Processes so it may  determine  which  certifications  are  aligned  with  them and those that cannot be accepted.\n\n## 3.4.4.1 Key Control Measures to Prevent Severe Impact on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\nNo Child Labor / Forced Labor. Kering and its Houses prohibit all  forms  of  child  labor  or  forced  labor  throughout  the  value chain  and  consider  them  breaches  for  which  they  have  zero tolerance, leading to an immediate termination of the supplier relationship.  As  such,  the  audits  performed  as  part  of  the Hercules  management  system  include  various  measures  to identify  potential  instances  of  child  labor  or  forced  labor.  In addition, the Kering Supply Chain Audit Department performs a  periodic  analysis  on  suppliers  to  assess  the  cost  of  their work per minute, which may lead to targeted investigations to understand  any  anomalies  identified  as  part  of  this  process (which might be an indicator of abusive work practices).\n\nPromoting Diversity and Preventing Discrimination. Kering and its Houses expect their business partners to respect and promote equal opportunity and treatment in employment and to create an inclusive workplace.  In addition to the commitments  included  in  the  Sustainability  Principles,  the audits performed as part of the Hercules management system also  review  potential  instances  of  discriminatory  practices within  the  operations  of  suppliers.  Kering  and  its  Italian Houses,  in  collaboration  with  the  Camera  Nazionale  della Moda  and  three  specialized  associations  (BSR,  Wise  Growth, and Valore D), issued practical recommendations  on enhancing gender equality in the Italian luxury sector supply chain following an extensive study that investigated challenges  faced  by  women  in  this  supply  chain.  This  study covered  more  than  180  suppliers  and  surveyed  880  people (70% women) on gender equality via in-person interviews and questionnaires.  Four  priority  focuses  were  identified  during the study: (i) 'working conditions and economic opportunities,' (ii)  'leadership  and  career  advancement,'  (iii)  'motherhood' and  (iv)  'workplace  conduct  and  harassment.'  Launched in  2020,  the  second  stage  of  the  project  focused  on  the implementation of the recommendations by raising awareness of the four identified priorities. Kering also worked on  a  project  focused  on  empowering  women  around  gold mines  in  Ghana  through, inter  alia ,  micro-loans  and  skills training,  and  worked  on  a  project  to  support  150  cotton farmers  in  India  through  community  education  on  women's rights, education and health and safety.\n\nFree from Harassment and Violence. Kering  and its  Houses expect  their  suppliers  to  treat  employees  with  dignity  and respect  and  to  prohibit  physical  punishment,  mental  or physical  coercion  or  verbal  abuse.  As  such,  suppliers  and sub-suppliers  must  not  engage  in  any  conduct  that  is offensive,  abusive,  demeaning,  intimidating  or  threatening, such  as  verbal  abuse,  negative  stereotyping,  unwelcome contact, unwelcome  sexual advances or requests for sexual  favors.  The  Kering  Foundation  has  been  involved  in supporting women impacted by violence, through partnering with  survivor-centered  services,  and  local  experts,  while implementing preventive programs with the youth to achieve real change.",

        "page_content": "Increased  Dialogue. Kering  and  its  Houses  expect  their business partners to engage in open and constructive dialogue with  workers  and  their  representatives  and  to  respect  the right  of  workers  to  form  and  join  organizations  of  their  own choosing  and  bargain  collectively. In addition to the commitments  included  in  the  Sustainability  Principles,  we note  that  the  audits  performed  as  part  of  the  Hercules management  system  cover, inter alia , the  freedom  of association and the right to collective bargaining.\n\nDecent  Working  Conditions. Kering  expects  its  suppliers  to pay their employees no less than the minimum legal standard or  the  appropriate  prevailing  industry  standard,  whichever  is higher.  Kering  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  workers  in  its supply  chain  are  fairly  compensated  for  their  work.  Kering expects business partners to comply with applicable regulations  regarding  working  hours,  whilst  not  exceeding 48 working hours per week. Wages and working hours are also expressly investigated by the audits performed as part of the Hercules  management  system,  which  cover  wages  and working  hours  as  well  as  subcontracting  and  the  risk  of illegally  resorting  to  subcontractors  that  have  underpaid workers. Among other initiatives, the Group is actively involved in  the  Utthan  project  in  India,  which  aims  at  ensuring  the empowerment  of  embroidery  craftsmen  and  craftswomen through, inter alia , the payment of living wages and regulated working hours.\n\nProtecting Against Local Community Abuses. Kering and its Houses are committed to respecting and actively contributing to  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the  local communities impacted by their operations worldwide. In this respect, Kering undertakes to, inter alia ,  avoid forced eviction and  the  displacement  of  populations  as  a  result  of  its operations.  Kering  and  its  Houses  further  encourage  their suppliers and sub-suppliers to build a constructive relationship with  local  communities,  and  require  them  to  source  raw materials in strict accordance with the Kering Standards and the Sustainability Principles.\n\n## 3.4.4.2 Key Control Measures to Prevent Severe Harm to the Health and Safety of Individuals\n\nSafe and Hygienic Working Conditions. Kering and its Houses expect  their  business  partners  to  create  a  healthy  and  safe working environment through the implementation of appropriate  effective  measures  to  avoid  jeopardizing  the health  and  safety  of  workers  in  the  workplace.  For  example, suppliers are required to provide relevant employees with the protection  equipment  prescribed  by  applicable  regulations and  offer  them  training  on  relevant  safety  standards  and procedures  that  they  should  follow.  Employees  should  also have  free  access  to  clean  toilet  facilities  and  potable  water. The  audits  performed  as  part  of  the  Hercules  management\n\nsystem expressly cover select issues dedicated to the review of health and safety practices within the workplace. In addition, in  2020,  Kering  conducted a survey relating to the impact of the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  the  dedicated  measures  that suppliers  had  been  implemented  to  ensure  the  health  and safety of employees.\n\nMinimizing  Chemicals  /  Hazardous  Substances. As  noted above, Kering is committed to phasing out and eliminating all hazardous  chemicals  from  its  production  processes.  The Group's  chemical  management  framework  goes  beyond regulatory requirements and includes specific guidelines, the PRSL and MRSL lists described above, that identify restricted substances within products and production processes. Kering requires all suppliers and sub-suppliers to strictly comply with this  framework and to report any non-compliance therewith. Compliance  with  these  requirements  is  also  investigated  as part  of  the  Hercules  audits  as  well  as  additional  chemical related audits targeting specific categories of suppliers at risk.\n\n## 3.4.4.3 Key Control Measures to Prevent Serious Environmental Damage\n\nEnvironment Profit & Losses. As noted above, the EP&L is the cornerstone  of  the  Group's  environmental  approach  and allows Kering and its Houses to measure their environmental impact  throughout  the  supply  chain.  Suppliers  and  subsuppliers  are  invited  to  share  information  on, inter  alia , air  emissions,  energy  use,  land  use,  waste  production,  water use and water discharge with Kering and its Houses. As further noted  above,  the  Group  has  undertaken  to  reduce  its  EP&L intensity by 40% by 2025 compared with 2015.\n\nSourcing  of  Raw  Materials. The  Group's  EP&L  clearly  shows that  most  of  the  environmental  impact  (67%)  is  caused upstream  of  its  supply  chains  by  the  production  of  raw materials  and  their  initial  transformation  (Tiers  3  and  4).  In 2021,  Kering  traced  90%  of  its  key  materials  back  to  their country of origin at least,  and  even  further  for  animal-based materials  (fur,  leather,  and  precious  skins).  By  2025,  Kering aims to ensure 100% traceability of its key raw materials and that  these  fully  comply  with  the  Kering  Standards  to  further reduce  its  environmental  footprint.  Kering  further  intends  to increase  the  scope  of  the  materials  covered  by  the  Kering Standards  and  scale  up  an  internal  purchasing  platform  to have  access  to  high  quality,  sustainable  raw  materials following the success of the Kering Ethical Gold platform.\n\nReducing  Carbon  Emissions. As  noted  above,  the  Group continues to offset greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, Kering voluntarily  offset  its  full  Scope  1,  2,  3  greenhouse  gas emissions  released  in  2020  amounting  to  1,779,888  tCO2. Carbon  credits  have  been  obtained  through  the  provision  of support for several REDD+ programs, with VCS certification.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  transition  to  a  circular  economy, which means rejecting the linear 'take - make - consume throw  away'  model,  involves  more  than  the  simple  use  of recycled  materials  or  the  design  of  recyclable  products:  it requires  real  change  in  practices  at  each  stage  of  the production  cycle.  As  such,  in  2021,  Kering  has  released  a report  presenting  its  new  ambitions  towards  a  circular economy,  and  participated  in  the  construction  of  the Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation's  vision  for  circular  fashion, published  in  October  2020  to  unite  the  sector  around  a common  frame  of  reference  and  definitions.  The  vision  is based on three pillars: 'used more', 'made to be made again', and  'made  from  safe  and  recycled  or  renewable  inputs',  on which  Kering  and  its  Houses  are  rolling  out  their  circular economy  approach.  The  first  pillar  of  circular  fashion  is  to create products that last and retain their value over time and to produce the right number of products so as to avoid unsold products.  The  second  pillar  of  circular  fashion  focuses  on efficiently  reusing,  upcycling  or  recycling  materials,  products and  packaging  while  working  to  strengthen  the  associated production  channels  in  close  collaboration  with  public  and private  stakeholders.  Kering  and  its  Houses  have  also launched  numerous  initiatives  and  entered  into  multiple partnerships  to  collect  waste  and  scraps  from  production processes  and  fashion  shows  with  a  view  to  recycling  or reusing them, or to donate materials and raw materials such as  fabrics.  The  third  pillar  of  the  vision  for  circular  fashion focuses  on  the  sound  management  of  chemicals,  the maximum  use  of  recycled  or  renewable  materials,  and recycling  at  every  stage  of  production.  As  regards  materials used,  the  Kering  Standards  allow  the  Group's  Houses  to identify  sourcing  preferences  -  recycled,  bio-sourced  or certified  -  by  material.  In  addition,  the  Materials  Innovation Lab provides House design teams with a pool of sustainable and innovative materials and assists them in the selection of circular  materials.  Kering  further  participates  in  the  Clean by  Design  program  launched  by  the  Natural  Resources Defense Council to have the Houses propose free environmental-related audits to suppliers, designed at improving their environmental-related practices, especially at reducing  waste  and  emissions.  Finally,  the  audits  performed as  part  of  the  Hercules  management system also investigate waste  management  practice  of  suppliers,  including  recycling practices.\n\nAnimal Welfare. Kering requires that its suppliers ensure that the  capture,  breeding,  raising,  transportation,  handling  and slaughter of animals occur in compliance with applicable local animal welfare, social, and environmental laws and regulations. As noted above, in 2019, Kering also published its\n\nStandards  for  all  animal  species  present  in  its  supply  chain and  released  standards  specifically  targeting  calves,  cattle, sheep  and  goats,  which  account  for  a  particularly  sizable proportion  of  the  leather  supply  chain.  To  go  further  on  its commitment  towards  animal  welfare,  in  September  2021, Kering announced that none of its Houses will use fur starting from their  Fall  2022  collections.  Teams  from  Kering  and  the Houses have carried out numerous farm visits in recent years, but they could not continue in 2020 due to the global health crisis. In 2020, Kering focused on active engagement with the various  potential  and  existing  suppliers  to  assess  and  assist them in improving their sustainable environmental, biodiversity,  and  animal  welfare  management  practices.  The Group also  continued  to  roll  out  its  action  plan  for  verifying the  alignment  of  the  Kering  Standards  with  practices  in  its exotic skin supply chains. The assessment is carried out with specific  programs  for  each  supply  chain,  taking  into  account the  characteristics  of  each  animal  species  and  each  type  of supplier. In this respect, it is worth noting that the Group and its  Houses comply with national and international legislation and  regulations  on  the  trade  of  precious  skins:  all  skins  of species  catalogued  as  endangered  or  vulnerable  by  the Convention  on  International  Trade  in  Endangered  Species ('CITES') are obtained with certificates attesting to their legal origin,  issued  by  CITES  and  the  export  authority,  to  ensure that trade does not threaten endangered species.\n\nProtecting  Biodiversity. As  noted  above,  as  part  of  its biodiversity  strategy,  Kering  is  committed  to  having  a  net positive impact on biodiversity by 2025. To achieve this, Kering has  agreed  to  protect  one  million  hectares  of  essential  and irreplaceable  habitats  outside  of  its  supply  chain,  and facilitate  through  the  Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature  the transition to regenerative agricultural practices on an additional one million hectares in areas where raw materials entering  Kering's  supply  chain  are  extracted.  In  addition,  the Houses avoid sourcing materials with known negative impacts on the environment, particularly in areas of critical ecological importance. As specified in the Kering Standards, this includes ensuring that supplies are all sourced from materials that do not  cause  deforestation  as  well  as  ensuring  that  materials adhere  closely  to  the  guidelines  as  published  within  the framework of CITES. When impacts are inevitable, Kering and its Houses  strive  to  reduce  negative  impacts  on  the environment by sourcing materials from preferred sources as defined  in  the  Kering  Standards,  which  list  recommended third  party  certifications  in  our  supply  chains  that  guarantee low-impact  agricultural  practices,  such  as  organic  farming for instance.",

        "page_content": "## 3.5 Alert mechanism\n\nIntroduced  in  2005,  Kering's  whistleblowing  system  was reinforced  in  2013  with  the  creation  of  two  regional  Ethics Committees  (Asia-Pacific  and  Americas),  supplementing  the Group  Ethics  Committee  established  in  place  in  2005,  and further  strengthened  in  2018  to, inter  alia , ensure  full compliance  with  France's  Sapin  II  law.  The  whistleblowing system is accessible to all Group employees as well as those of any service provider or external partner with whom the Group and/or  its  Houses  maintain  contractual  relationships.  Once the  whistleblowing  system  was  opened  to  all  suppliers  and service  providers,  these  third  parties  have  been  informed accordingly.\n\nAlerts received through the Group whistleblowing system are handled  by  the  Group's  Compliance  Organization  and  Ethics Committee,  this  latter  being  chaired  by  the  Kering  Chief Sustainability  and  Institutional  Affairs  Officer.  Kering  is  fully committed to ensuring the strict confidentiality of the identity of  the  whistleblower  and  the  information  detailed  in  the report, and prohibits the adoption of retaliation measures of\n\nany sort against those who report in good faith. The Group's whistleblowing procedure is fully detailed in the Kering Code of Ethics, which is publicly available on the Group's website.\n\nKering is committed to ensuring that all alerts, including those related  to  the  implementation  of  the  Duty  of  Care  Law,  are properly addressed and the underlying behavior is adequately remediated.\n\nIn  2020,  Kering  undertook  an  extensive  communication campaign  designed  to, inter  alia ,  remind  the  employees  of its  direct  suppliers  of  its  whistleblowing  system  and  how  to use  it.  The  campaign  was  translated  into  15  languages  and took two forms: (i) a poster displayed in relevant locations at supplier  and  service  provider  sites,  to  gain  the  greatest visibility  (cafeteria,  locker  rooms,  site  entrance,  etc.)  and (ii) a flyer to be given directly to employees. This campaign has been updated in 2021 to target newly enlisted suppliers. More information  on  the  roll-out  of  this  campaign  and  its  update can be found on section 2.3 of the Sustainability chapter.\n\n## 3.6 Monitoring system designed to assess the effectiveness of the controls in place\n\nAs  noted  above,  Kering  periodically  updates  its  risk  mapping to  ensure  the  constant  evaluation  of  the  controls  designed to mitigate risks relevant to the Duty of Care Law. The results of  the  2021  risk  mapping,  as  well  as  the  general  action plan  associated  thereto,  were  shared  with  the  Group  Audit Committee in early June 2021.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  Kering  internal  controls  system within the Group's internal operations is periodically assessed by the Group  Internal  Audit  Department  through  the performance of internal audits performed in accordance with the Group's annual audit plan. In addition, as noted above, the overall  implementation of the action plan adopted following the 2021 risk mapping is supervised by the Group Compliance Department,  which  conducts  regular  reviews  designed  to ensure  that  the  Kering  compliance-related  policies  and procedures  are  properly  implemented  by  Group  entities  and\n\nHouses, including from a human rights compliance perspective. Furthermore, a number of functions at the Group level, including the Sustainability Department  and  the Inclusion  &  Diversity  team,  support  the  Houses  with  respect to the implementation of Kering's policies and strategies.\n\nAs  to  the  Group's  supply  chain,  as  noted  above,  the  Kering Supply  Chain  Audit  Department  conducts  regular  audits designed  to  evaluate  the  implementation  of  the  Kering Sustainability  Principles  by  the  Group's  suppliers,  including with  respect  to  human  rights,  health  and  safety  and environmental protection.\n\nKering has  also  established  tracking  and  performance indicators designed to further monitor the effective implementation of the controls summarized above.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These consolidated financial statements  will  only  be  considered  as  final  after  their adoption by the April 28, 2022 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 reflect  the  accounting  position  of  Kering  SA,  its  subsidiaries and its associates (the 'Group').\n\nPursuant to European Regulation No. 1606/2002 of July 19, 2002, these  consolidated  financial  statements  were  prepared  in accordance  with  applicable  international  financial  reporting standards (IFRSs) as published and endorsed by the European Union and mandatorily applicable as of the reporting date.\n\nThe  accounting  policies  and  methods  applied  by  the  Group pursuant to IFRSs are set out in Note 33 - Accounting policies and methods.\n\n## NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 2021\n\n## Investment in Vestiaire Collective\n\nOn  March  1,  2021,  Kering  announced  that  it  had  acquired  a stake of around 5% in Vestiaire Collective, the leading global platform for desirable second-hand fashion, as part of a new \u20ac178 million financing round together with a new shareholder,  US  investment  firm  Tiger  Global  Management. Existing  shareholders  including  Vestiaire  Collective's  CEO, Maximilian Bittner, Bpifrance, Conde Nast, the Eurazeo Group, certain  funds  managed  by  Fidelity  International,  Korelya Capital, Luxury  Tech  Fund  and  Vitruvian  Partners  also reinvested.\n\nFollowing  a  strong  year  in  2020  that  saw  the  platform's transaction  volume  grow  over  100%  year-on-year,  this financing  round  granted  Vestiaire  Collective  unicorn  status and ideally positions it for its next cycle of accelerated growth.\n\nBy  investing  in  Vestiaire  Collective  and  by  being  represented on the platform's Board of Directors, Kering is illustrating its pioneering  strategy,  which  consists  of  supporting  innovative business models, embracing new market trends and exploring new services to fashion and luxury customers.\n\n## Kering enhances its global logistics capabilities with a new hub in Northern Italy\n\nOn April 8, 2021, Kering announced the completion of the first phase  of  its  new  global  logistics  hub  in  Trecate,  in  the Piemonte region of Northern Italy. The first part of the building has  been  operating  since  March  2020,  and  the  second  part (over 100,000 sq.m) has come into service gradually since  the third quarter of 2021.\n\nBuilt  in  record  time,  the  Group's  new  global  logistics  hub covers  more  than  162,000  sq.m  (equivalent  to  20  football fields) and combines state-of-the-art technology with automation, scalability, innovative sustainability and features for the well-being of employees.\n\n## Sale of a 5.91% stake in PUMA\n\nOn  May  27,  2021,  Kering  announced  the  completion  of  the sale, following an accelerated bookbuilding process to qualified investors only, of 5.91% of the share capital of PUMA SE for a total amount of approximately \u20ac805 million, corresponding to a sale price of \u20ac90.3 per PUMA share.\n\nThe  hub  will  meet  the  demand  from  the  Houses'  regional warehouses, retail stores, wholesalers and e-commerce operations worldwide, and will significantly increase the Group's capabilities  in  terms  of  shipping  (up  to  80  million  pieces  per year)  and  storage  (up  to  20  million  pieces).  It  will  also  reduce lead  times  by  50%  by  increasing  the  speed  of  deliveries  and enhance collaboration with the Group's Houses.\n\nMore than 250 people are currently working in the facility, with the total number of staff planned to reach approximately 900 by  the  end  of  2022.  The  site  is  operated  by  XPO  Logistics, Kering's  longstanding  logistics  partner,  which  employs  the on-site workforce dedicated to warehouse operations.\n\nFollowing this transaction, Kering has a remaining 3.96% stake in PUMA.\n\nThe  net  proceeds  of  the  transaction  have  been  allocated  to Kering's general corporate purposes  and  have  further strengthened its financial position.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance at Kering\n\nAs a result of her changing roles within Exor, of which she is also a board member, and in order to avoid any potential conflict of interests, Ginevra Elkann resigned from her position as a member of Kering's Board of Directors as of April 27, 2021.\n\n## Kering Eyewear acquires the Danish luxury eyewear brand LINDBERG\n\nOn July 8, 2021, Kering Eyewear and the Lindberg family signed an  agreement  for  Kering  Eyewear  to  acquire  100%  of LINDBERG's  share  capital.  The  acquisition  was  completed  on September 30, 2021.\n\nLINDBERG was founded in 1969 in Denmark by optician PoulJ\u00f8rn  Lindberg  and  his  wife  as  an  optical  store,  and  it  was turned  into  a  multinational  company  by  their  son  Henrik. LINDBERG is now a high-end manufacturer of design-oriented, lightweight and customizable optical frames, and specializes in  titanium frames. The company's reputation has been built on  its  made-to-order  capabilities,  offering  customers  the possibility to create their very own bespoke pair of LINDBERG glasses through an extended modular system which contains billions  of  combinations,  in  a  wide  array  of  materials  from titanium to acetate, buffalo horn, wood and precious metals. LINDBERG  has  developed  and  patented  manufacturing techniques  and  innovations  such  as  hypoallergenic,  multiadjustable  and  screwless  frames  that  are  key  differentiating factors  in  the  high-end  eyewear  market.  LINDBERG  is  a genuine  pioneer  in  the  luxury  eyewear  industry  and  holds  a unique  position  within  it,  and  is  now  a  sizeable  and  very profitable company with strong growth potential.\n\nThis  acquisition  is  an  important  milestone  in  the  successful expansion  of  Kering  Eyewear  and  fits  perfectly  with  its development  strategy.  Since  its  launch  in  2014,  Kering Eyewear  has  built  an  innovative  business  model  that  has enabled  the  company  to  achieve  critical  size  in  its  market, with revenue of around \u20ac700 million in 2021. The acquisition will further strengthen Kering Eyewear's position as the most relevant  player  in  the  luxury  eyewear  segment,  adding  to  its portfolio a complementary and proprietary brand with strong legitimacy, undisputed know-how and best-in-class customer service in optical frames. Thanks to the good fit between their businesses,  both  companies  are  able  to  leverage  their respective strengths across the value chain, with synergies in distribution and geographical reach particularly This is helping to  accelerate  the  growth  and  enhance  the  profitability  of Kering Eyewear.\n\nLINDBERG's  entities  have  been  included  in  the  Group's consolidated financial statements since September 30, 2021. The  allocation  of  the  purchase  price  will  be  completed  in 2022.\n\n## Allocation of the first tranche of repurchased shares\n\nThe Group completed the first tranche of the stock repurchase program  that  it  announced  on  August  25,  2021.  The purchases  took  place  under  the  authorization  granted  by shareholders in the July 6, 2021 Annual General Meeting.\n\nBetween  August  25  and  November  3,  2021,  650,000  shares were repurchased at an average price of \u20ac643.70 per share, i.e. for a total of \u20ac418.4 million. Of the shares repurchased in that first  tranche,  325,000  were  canceled  on  December  10,  2021.\n\nThe  remaining  repurchased  shares  were  used  to  cover  free share plans for the Group's employees.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, the Group also repurchased 204,211 of its shares under authorizations granted by shareholders in the June 16, 2020 and April 22, 2021 AGMs. All of those shares were  allocated  to  covering  free  share  plans  and  other  longterm  incentive  plans  under  which  employees  receive  Kering shares.\n\n## Change of Creative Director at Bottega Veneta\n\nOn  November  10,  2021,  Bottega  Veneta  and  Daniel  Lee announced  their  joint  decision  to  end  their  collaboration. Daniel Lee had been at the creative helm of the House since July 1, 2018. He brought new energy to the House and greatly contributed  to  the  new  momentum  that  Bottega  Veneta  is enjoying today.\n\nOn  November  15,  2021,  Bottega  Veneta  announced  the appointment  of  Matthieu  Blazy  as  Creative  Director.  Born  in Paris  in  1984,  Matthieu  Blazy  is  a  graduate  of  La  Cambre  in\n\nBrussels.  He  started  his  fashion  career  as  Men's  Designer  for Raf  Simons,  before  joining  Maison  Martin  Margiela  to  design the Artisanal line and the Women's ready-to-wear (RTW) show. In  2014,  he  became Senior Designer at C\u00e9line, before working again with Raf Simons at Calvin Klein from 2016 to 2019. He was appointed RTW Design Director at Bottega Veneta in 2020. A French and Belgian national, he lives between Antwerp and Milan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Combining  an innovative approach to design and technical know-how, they have revamped their product universes, launched new iconic models and reorganized their distribution, with the opening of directly  operated  stores  and  stronger  ties  with  the  leading watch distributors.\n\nThe Group has supported the two Houses in their development, strengthened  their  market  positions  and  ensured  they  have adequate  resources  to  finance  their  growth.  The  Group  is confident  that  their  existing  management  will  be  able  to continue their work successfully.\n\nThis transaction is in line with Kering's strategy, giving priority to  Houses  that  have  the  potential  to  become  sizable  assets within the Group and to which it can provide decisive support over time.\n\nThe transaction should be completed by the end of the first half of 2022 (see Note 8).\n\n## NOTE 4 -

The  Group  recognizes  its  obligation  as  services  are rendered by the beneficiaries, over the period from the grant date to the vesting date:\n\n- \u00b7 the  grant  date  is  the  date  on  which  the  plans  were individually approved by the relevant decision-making body (Board of Directors or other) and corresponds to the initial measurement date of the plans;\n- \u00b7 as  from  the  grant  date,  the  rights  vesting  period  is  the so-called 'lock-in' period during which the specified vesting conditions  are  to  be  satisfied  (service  conditions  for  all beneficiaries,  plus  performance  conditions  for  executive corporate officers);\n- \u00b7 the  exercise  date  is  the  date  at  which  all  of  the  specified vesting conditions have been satisfied, and as of which the beneficiaries are entitled to ask for payment of their rights. Vested rights may be exercised over a period of two years, during which beneficiaries can opt to cash out some or all of their KMUs in April or October, at their discretion, based on the most recently determined value.\n\nThe  unit  value  of  the  KMUs  awarded  is  determined  and changes  based  on  movements  in  the  Kering  share  price  by itself  and  in  comparison  with  the  average  performance  of  a basket of seven stocks from the luxury industry.\n\n| Year granted                                       | 2017    | 2018     | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|\n| Vesting period                                     | 3 years | 3 years  | 3 years |\n| Exercise period                                    | 2 years | 2 years  | 2 years |\n| Number of beneficiaries                            | 319     | 331      | 345     |\n| Number initially granted                           | 111,000 | 64,281   | 38,205  |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2020                    | 1,462   | 41,695   | 35,391  |\n| Number granted                                     | -       | -        | -       |\n| Number forfeited                                   |         | (1,292)  | (1,767) |\n| Number exercised                                   | (1,462) | (31,566) | N/A     |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021                    | -       | 8,837    | 33,624  |\n| o/w exercisable as of December 31, 2021            | -       | 8,837    | N/A     |\n| Unit fair value at grant date  (in \u20ac)              | 249.0   | 581.0    | 753.0   |\n| Weighted average price per instrument paid  (in \u20ac) | 1,173.8 | 1,214.8  | N/A     |\n\n## 7.2 Plans settled in Kering shares\n\nAt the Combined General Meeting of June 16, 2020, within the scope of the sixteenth resolution, the shareholders authorized the  Board  of  Directors  to  purchase,  retain  or  transfer  Kering SA  shares.  In  the  seventeenth  resolution,  the  shareholders also authorized the Board of Directors to make free grants of ordinary shares of Kering SA (existing or to be issued), subject,\n\nwhere applicable, to performance conditions, to beneficiaries or  categories  of  beneficiaries  among  the  employees  and executive  corporate  officers  of  Kering  SA  and  affiliated companies,  entailing  the  waiver  by  shareholders  of  their pre-emptive subscription rights.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The characteristics of these plans are as follows:\n\n| Year granted                          | 2020        | 2021        |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Vesting period                        | 3 years     | 3 years     |\n| Number of beneficiaries               | 351         | 372         |\n| Number initially granted              | 46,596      | 42,752      |\n| Maximum grant at grant date           | 69,107      | 63,427      |\n| Minimum grant at grant date           | 24,086      | 22,082      |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2020       | 45,719      | -           |\n| Number granted                        | -           | 42,752      |\n| Change related to performance         | (20,829)    | (3,953)     |\n| Number forfeited                      | (1,995)     | (456)       |\n| Number delivered                      | -           | -           |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021       | 22,895      | 38,343      |\n| Unit fair value at grant date  (in \u20ac) | 542.6-608.7 | 622.5-628.3 |\n\nUnder  performance  share  plans,  the  final  number  of  shares delivered to beneficiaries who continue to be employed by the Group  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period  cannot  be  less  than 50%  or  more  than  50%  of  the  initial  grant  made  to  these beneficiaries.  The  performance  adjustment  ratio  used  to calculate  the  final  number  of  shares  to  be  delivered  is determined in line with Kering's  share  performance  over  the three-year  vesting  period  versus  the  performance  of  the industry as a whole, as measured based on an index of eight European luxury stocks. As well as the performance conditions applicable to all beneficiaries, specific performance conditions apply to the corporate officers, as outlined at the Annual General Meetings of June 16, 2020 and April 22, 2021.\n\n## Other free share and performance share plans\n\nKering  may  also  include  share-based  payments  in  plans specifically  introduced  for  key  executives  from  the  Houses, reflecting the creation of value at their respective brands.\n\nA  plan  of  this  type  was  set  up  in  2020  and  provides  for settlement in Kering shares after a vesting period of five years. The fair value of this benefit at the grant date was calculated by an independent expert using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods and amounts to \u20ac54.7 million.\n\n## NOTE 8 - OTHER NON-RECURRING OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\nSee Note 33.1.5 for details of other non-recurring operating items shown within operating income.\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                                             | Notes   | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Non-recurring operating expenses                                            |         | (224.6) | (542.4) |\n| Estimated fair value of the disposal of Girard-Perregaux  and Ulysse Nardin |         | (139.9) | -       |\n| Impairment of goodwill, brands and other non-current assets                 | 14      | (69.1)  | (446.6) |\n| Impairment of goodwill                                                      |         | -       | (51.1)  |\n| Impairment of brands                                                        |         | -       | (327.7) |\n| Impairment of other non-current assets                                      |         | (69.1)  | (67.8)  |\n| Other non-recurring operating expenses                                      |         | (15.6)  | (95.8)  |\n| Restructuring costs                                                         | 25      | (9.1)   | (41.3)  |\n| Other                                                                       |         | (6.5)   | (54.5)  |\n| Non-recurring operating income                                              |         | 4.8     | 705.4   |\n| Capital gain on PUMA shares                                                 | 17      | -       | 704.6   |\n| Other non-recurring operating income                                        |         | 4.8     | 0.8     |\n| TOTAL                                                                       |         | (219.8) | 163.0   |",

        "page_content": "## Sale of Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin\n\nAfter discussions that began in 2021, the Group announced on January  24,  2022  the  signature  of  an  agreement  to  sell  its entire stake (100%) in Sowind Group SA (Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse  Nardin),  to  its  current  management.  As  a  result,  all assets and liabilities of Sowind Group SA and its subsidiaries were  reclassified  as  assets  held  for  sale  and  liabilities\n\nassociated with assets held for sale as of December 31, 2021. The  expected  loss  on  disposal  was  recognized  at  fair  value under  'Other  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses' for 2021. The transaction should be completed by the end of the first half of 2022.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill, brands and other non-current assets\n\nIn 2021, non-recurring impairment charges related mainly to information systems and software, the development of which was made partly obsolete by the deployment of new solutions.\n\nIn 2020, asset impairment amounted to \u20ac446.6 million and to a  very  large  extent  concerned  the  Ulysse  Nardin,  GirardPerregaux and Brioni brands, which were particularly hard hit by the pandemic.\n\n## Other non-recurring operating income and expenses\n\nIn 2021, other non-recurring operating income and expenses were not material either individually or in aggregate.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  continued  to  reduce  its  investment  in PUMA, selling a 5.83% stake at a price of \u20ac74.50 per share on October 8,  2020.  As  a  result,  it  booked  a  capital  gain  on  the\n\nsale of that 5.83% interest and on the remeasured value of its remaining 9.87% shareholding. As of the date of the sale, the Group's  residual  interest  in  PUMA  was  reclassified  in  the balance sheet from 'Investments in equity-accounted companies' to 'Non-consolidated investments' within 'Non-current financial assets' (see Note 17).\n\n## NOTE 9 - FINANCIAL RESULT\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                                                   | Notes   | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Cost of net debt (1)                                                              | 21      | (38.2)  | (43.3)  |\n| Income from cash and cash equivalents                                             |         | 7.9     | 6.7     |\n| Finance costs at amortized cost                                                   |         | (46.1)  | (50.0)  |\n| Other financial income and expenses                                               |         | (128.9) | (185.5) |\n| Net gains (losses) on financial assets                                            |         | 1.6     | 11.9    |\n| Net foreign exchange gains (losses)                                               |         | 1.3     | (32.2)  |\n| Ineffective portion of cash flow and fair value hedges                            | 22      | (83.3)  | (114.4) |\n| Net gains (losses) on derivative instruments not qualifying  for hedge accounting | 22      | (32.3)  | (32.1)  |\n| Impact of discounting assets and liabilities                                      |         | (0.1)   | (0.1)   |\n| Other finance costs                                                               |         | (16.1)  | (18.6)  |\n| Financial result excluding leases                                                 |         | (167.1) | (228.8) |\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities                                             | 15.3    | (106.1) | (112.9) |\n| TOTAL                                                                             |         | (273.2) | (341.7) |\n\nIn 2021, the cost of net debt was \u20ac38.2 million (\u20ac43.3 million in 2020). The improvement mainly reflects the decrease in the average coupon paid on bond debt.\n\nOther financial income and expense produced a net expense of \u20ac128.9 million in 2021, a significant decrease compared to the 2020 figure of \u20ac185.5 million due to the reduced financial cost  of  currency  hedges  and  the  non-recurrence  of  negative exchange-rate effects seen in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, with respect to wholesalers, the Group has no dependency or concentration risk.

The latest agreement was  signed  on  February  13,  2019,  in  accordance  with  AMF ruling no. 2018-01  of  July  2,  2018,  applicable  since\n\nJanuary 1, 2019. An amendment to that agreement came into force  on  July  1,  2021,  providing  for  the  resources  in  the liquidity  account  to  be  reduced  by  \u20ac25  million.  As  a  result, there was \u20ac25 million in the liquidity account on July 1, 2021.\n\n## Stock repurchase program and allocation to free share plans\n\nWithin the scope of the plan authorized at the Annual General Meeting  of  June  16,  2020  under  the  sixteenth  resolution, Kering extended on December 21, 2020 the initial instruction given to an investment services provider on December 10, 2020 to purchase 50,000 shares by March  31,  2021  at  the  latest  and  depending  on  market conditions,  by  75,000  ordinary  Kering  shares,  representing approximately 0.06% of the share capital as of December 15, 2020. These shares were to be allocated to free share  plans  and  other  long-term  incentive  plans  granted  to employees  and  payable  in  Kering  shares.  The  unit  purchase price of the shares was not to exceed the maximum price set at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  on  June  16,  2020.  Under  that instruction, 30,000 shares were purchased in 2021.\n\nOn  February  22,  2021,  still  within  the  scope  of  the  plan authorized  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  June  16,  2020 under  the  sixteenth  resolution  and  on  the  same  terms  as those  mentioned  above,  Kering  instructed  an  investment services  provider  to  purchase,  by  April  16,  2021  at  the  latest and depending on market conditions, up to 250,000 ordinary Kering  shares,  representing  approximately  0.2%  of  the  share capital  as  of  January  15,  2021.  These  shares  were  to  be allocated  to  free  share  plans  and  other  long-term  incentive plans  granted  to  employees  and  payable  in  Kering  shares. Under  that  instruction,  142,723  shares  were  purchased  in 2021.\n\nOn May 6, 2021, within the scope of the stock repurchase plan authorized  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  April  22,  2021 under  the  fourteenth  resolution, Kering instructed an\n\ninvestment services provider to purchase, by June 25, 2021 at the latest and depending on market conditions, up to 200,000 ordinary Kering shares, representing almost 0.2% of the share capital as of April 15, 2021. These shares were to be allocated to  free  share  plans  and  other  long-term  incentive  plans granted to employees and payable in Kering shares. The unit purchase price of the shares was not to exceed the maximum price  set  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  April  22,  2021. Under that instruction, 31,488 shares were purchased in 2021.\n\nFinally, on August 25, 2021, Kering announced its intention to repurchase up to 2.0% of its share capital in the following 24 months as part of its stock repurchase program authorized at the Annual General Meeting of July 6, 2021, the scope of which may be adjusted  in  the  next  Annual  General  Meeting  due  to take place in 2022. Kering also stated that it reserved the right to  stop  the  program  at  any  time  depending  on  market circumstances  or  its  investment  strategy.  The  intention  is  to cancel the repurchased shares, except for those that may be allocated to plans for the remuneration of Group employees in Kering  shares.  Accordingly,  Kering  entered  into  a  stock repurchase  agreement  with  an  investment  service  provider. The agreement, which was for a maximum duration of three months, related to an initial tranche of up to 650,000 shares, i.e. around 0.5% of the share capital, subject to a limit of \u20ac650 million and a price per share of no more than \u20ac1,000, which was determined by the sole resolution adopted by shareholders in the July 6, 2021 AGM. Under that agreement, 650,000 shares were repurchased in 2021. Half of them were canceled and the other half were intended to cover plans to award free shares to Group employees.",

The redemption and/or exchange price of these bonds is therefore linked to changes in the PUMA  share  price. As of December  31,  2021  and  at  the  issue  date,  the  reference exchange price was set at \u20ac92.17.\n\nBased  on  market  data  as  of  December  31,  2021,  a  10% increase  in  PUMA's  share  price  would  have  a  positive \u20ac64.2 million impact on the total value of the PUMA shares in the consolidated balance sheet, but a negative \u20ac47.7 million\n\nThe  impact  on  financial  result  in  the  income  statement  is generated  by  foreign  exchange  instruments  not  eligible  for hedge  accounting  and  from  the  change  in  the  ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.\n\nimpact on the Group's pre-tax consolidated income owing to the \u20ac47.7 million increase in the carrying amount of the equity component recognized as a derivative liability at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. Conversely, a 10% decrease in PUMA's  share  price  would  have  a  negative  \u20ac64.2  million impact  on  the  total  value  of  the  PUMA  shares  in  the consolidated  balance  sheet,  but  a  positive  \u20ac40.1  million impact on the Group's pre-tax consolidated income owing to the  \u20ac40.1  million  decrease  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the equity  component  recognized  as  a  derivative  liability  at  fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nOther  shares  held  in  connection  with  non-consolidated investments represent a low exposure risk for the Group and are not hedged.\n\n## 22.4 Exposure to precious metals price risk\n\nThe  Group  may  be  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  the  price  of certain  precious  metals  within  the  scope  of  its  brands' activities  in  the  Watches  and  Jewelry  segments.  Hedges  may therefore  be  put  in  place  by  arranging  derivative  financial instruments to fix the production cost or by negotiating prices with refiners or manufacturers of semi-finished products.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  these  hedging  transactions  with  a residual maturity of less than one year are treated as forward purchases in a notional amount of \u20ac31.2 million. They have a positive  market  value  of  \u20ac1.4  million  (notional  amount  of \u20ac9.4 million as of December 31, 2020).\n\nA  sudden  1%  increase  or  decrease  in  precious  metals  prices would have a direct impact of \u20ac0.3 million (excluding the tax effect) on equity via the remeasurement of financial instruments.",

These additional  benefits  take  the  form  of  defined  contribution  or defined benefit plans.\n\nUnder defined contribution plans, the Group is not obliged to make any additional payments beyond contributions already made. Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred.\n\nAn actuarial valuation of defined benefit plans is carried out by  independent  experts.  These  benefits  primarily  concern mandatory  supplementary  pension  plans  in  Switzerland, statutory  dismissal  compensation  in  Italy,  and  retirement termination payments and long-service bonuses in France.\n\n## Mandatory supplementary pension plans (LPP) - Switzerland\n\nIn  Switzerland,  pension  plans  are  defined  contribution  plans that guarantee a minimum yield and provide for a fixed salary conversion  rate  on  retirement.  However,  the  pension  plans operated by the Group's entities in Switzerland offer benefits over and above those stipulated in the LPP/BVG pension law. Consequently,  a  provision  is  booked  in  respect  of  defined benefit  plans  for  the  amounts  that  exceed  LPP/BVG  pension law requirements.\n\nThese pension plans are generally operated as separate legal entities in the form of a foundation, which may be a collective institution  or  affiliated  to  a  specific  plan.  The  Board  of Trustees of these foundations, comprising an equal number of employer  and  employee  representatives,  is  responsible  for administering  the  plan  and  bears  the  investment  and longevity risks. Collective foundations insure some of their risk with an insurance company.\n\n## Statutory dismissal compensation (TFR) Italy\n\nThe  TFR  (Trattamento  di  Fine  Rapporto)  plans  in  Italy  were created  by  Law  no.  297,  adopted  on  May  29,  1982,  and  are applicable to all workers in the private sector on termination of employment for whatever reason (resignation, termination at  the  employer's  initiative,  death,  incapacity  or  retirement). Since 2007, companies with at least 50 employees have had to transfer  their  TFR  funding  to  an  external  fund  manager.  This concerns the large majority of plans operated by Kering group companies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amount paid depends on the number of years of service on retirement, and is defined in the relevant collective bargaining agreement. The payments  do  not  confer  any  vested entitlement  to  employees  until  they  reach  retirement  age.\n\nRetirement  termination  benefits  are  not  related  to  other statutory retirement benefits such as pensions paid by social security  bodies  or  top-up  pension  funds  such  as  ARRCO  and AGIRC in France, which are defined contribution plans.\n\nLong-service bonuses are not compulsory in France (there is no  legal  obligation  to  pay  these  awards  to  employees),  but hold  symbolic  value.  Nevertheless,  some  of  Kering's  French entities  choose  to  pay  long-service  bonuses  after  20,  30,  35 and 40 years of service.\n\n## 24.2 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                            |   Dec. 31, 2021 |   Dec. 31, 2020 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Non-current provisions                                     |            88.9 |           107.5 |\n| Current provisions                                         |            12.3 |            12.2 |\n| Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits |           101.2 |           119.7 |\n\n|                                                        | 2021                                | 2021                       | 2021                                                         | 2021                                                           | 2021             | 2020                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                        | Present value of benefit obligation | Fair value of  plan assets | Provisions for pensions and other post- employment  benefits | Change during the period Gains and losses recognized in equity | Income statement | Provisions for pensions and other post- employment  benefits |\n| As of January 1                                        | 224.4                               | 104.7                      | 119.7                                                        | -

This  amendment  has  no impact for the Group;\n- \u00b7 the amendment to IFRS 16 adopted by the IASB in March 2021 and  endorsed  by  the  European  Union  in  August  2021, extending  the  period  of  application  of  COVID-19-related rent concessions to June 30, 2022 (see Note 33.13.6);\n- \u00b7 the IFRIC's interpretation of IAS 19 relating to the allocation of  employee benefits to periods of service,  which  clarifies the  attribution  periods  to  be  taken  into  account  to determine the benefit expense: the impacts are non-material for the Group;\n- \u00b7 the IFRIC's interpretation of IAS 38 regarding the recognition of the costs of configuring or customizing software used in a SaaS (Software as a Service) arrangement, which provides details  about  criteria  for  recognizing  those  costs  as intangible assets or expenses. The impact is currently being analyzed by the Group but is likely to be non-material.\n\n## 33.1.2 Balance-sheet presentation and ESEF reporting\n\nWith the first-time application of ESEF  to  its 2021 consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Group  amended  the presentation of some of its balance sheet items in line with the  XBRL  taxonomy  as  from  its  first-half  2021  financial statements.  This  change  of  presentation  concerns  the  line items  previously  entitled  \"Trade  receivables\"  and  \"Trade payables\",  which  have  been  renamed  \"Trade  receivables  and accrued income\" and \"Trade payables and accrued expenses\", respectively. Certain amounts have therefore been reclassified from the \"Other  current  assets\"  and  \"Other  current  liabilities\" lines, respectively. The amounts presented for the comparative  period  (i.e.  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020) have also been reclassified. This change of presentation does not affect the calculation of  working capital requirement, but alters  the  breakdown  between  operating  working  capital requirement  and  the  non-operating  component  of  working capital requirement.\n\n## 33.1.3 Use of estimates and judgment\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Group management to make estimates and assumptions that can  affect  the  carrying  amounts  of  certain  assets  and liabilities,  income  and  expenses,  and  the  disclosures  in  the accompanying  notes.  Group  management  reviews  these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis to ensure their pertinence  with  respect  to  past  experience  and  the  current economic situation. Items in future financial statements may differ  from  current  estimates as a result of changes in these\n\nassumptions. The impact of changes in accounting estimates is  recognized  during  the  period  in  which  the  change  occurs and all affected future periods.\n\nThe main estimates made by management in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements concern goodwill and brands, the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets,  contingency  provisions  and  uncertain  tax positions, inventory impairment provisions, assumptions used to  calculate  lease  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities, provisions for pensions and long-term remuneration including share-based  payment,  the  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets and certain financial instruments.\n\nIn addition to the use of estimates, Group management uses judgment to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for  certain  transactions,  pending  the  clarification  of  certain IFRSs or where prevailing standards do not cover the issue at hand. Put options granted to minority interests, for example, are a case in point.\n\n## 33.1.4 Climate risks\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  Group's  2025  sustainability strategy - particularly measures relating to the supply chain, production  and  transportation,  along  with  initiatives  to promote a circular economy and to preserve natural resources -  will  affect  some  of  the  Group's  operational  performance indicators  to  some  extent.  In  particular,  the  strategy  could result  in  an  increase  in  raw  materials  and  production  costs, higher expenditure on research and development, certification and training costs and changes in the useful lives and residual values  of  certain  assets.  However,  those  impacts  are  not currently material for the Group.\n\nWhen preparing its impairment tests, the Group also took into account  the  short-term  costs  of  implementing  the  2025 sustainability strategy within its business plans. As regards the other  aspects  of  those  business  plans  -  such  as  revenue, growth  targets  and  discount  rates  -  since  the  financial impacts are not currently quantifiable and in the absence of market data on the subject, sensitivity analyses were adjusted and applied using riskier assumptions.\n\n## 33.1.5 Use of alternative performance indicators\n\nThe alternative performance indicators used by the Group and presented in the consolidated financial statements are:\n\n## Recurring operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses\n\nThe  Group's  operating  income  includes  all  revenues  and expenses  directly  related  to  its  activities,  whether  these revenues and expenses are recurring or arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.",

        "page_content": "Other non-recurring operating income and expenses consist of items that, by their nature, amount or frequency, could distort the  assessment  of  the  Group's  operating  performance  as reflected  in  its  recurring  operating  income.  They  include changes  in  Group  structure,  the  impairment  of  goodwill  and brands and, where material, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes (see Note 8).\n\n\"Recurring operating income\" is therefore a major indicator for the  Group,  defined  as  the  difference  between  operating income  and  other  non-recurring  operating  income  and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring  performance.  This  indicator  is  presented  in  a manner  that  is  consistent  and  stable  over  the  long  term  in order  to  ensure  the  continuity  and  relevance  of  financial information (see Note 4).\n\n## 33.2 Consolidation principles\n\nThe  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the financial  statements  of  the  companies  listed  in  Note  34.  They include the financial statements of companies acquired as from the  acquisition  date  and  companies  sold  up  until  the  date  of disposal.\n\n## 33.2.1 Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which  the  Group  exercises  control.  Control  is  defined according to three criteria: power over the investee; exposure, or  rights,  to  variable  returns  from  involvement  with  the investee;  and  the  ability  to  exert  power  over  the  investee  to affect the amount of the investor's returns. This definition of control  implies  that  power  over  an  investee  can  take  many forms other than simply holding voting rights. The existence and  effect  of  potential  voting  rights  are  considered  when assessing  control,  if  the  rights  are  substantive.  Control generally implies directly or indirectly holding more than 50% of the voting rights but can also exist when less than 50% of the voting rights are held.\n\nSubsidiaries  are  consolidated  from  the  effective  date  of control.\n\nIntercompany  assets  and  liabilities  as  well  as  transactions between  consolidated  companies  are  eliminated.  Gains  and losses on internal transactions with controlled companies are fully eliminated.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nThe Group uses EBITDA to monitor its operating performance. This  financial  indicator  corresponds  to  recurring  operating income  plus  net  charges  to  depreciation,  amortization  and provisions  on  non-current  operating  assets  recognized  in recurring operating income (see Note 4).\n\n## Effective tax rate on recurring income\n\nThe effective tax rate on recurring income corresponds to the effective  tax  rate  excluding  tax  effects  relating  to  other non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses  (see  Notes  8 and 10).\n\n## Net debt\n\nNet debt is one of the Group's main financial indicators, and is defined  as  borrowings  less  cash  and  cash  equivalents. Consequently, the cost of net debt corresponds to all financial income and expenses associated with these items, including the  impact  of  derivative  instruments  used  to  hedge  the  fair value  of  borrowings  (see  Note  9).  Borrowings  include  put options granted to minority interests (see Note 33.21).\n\n## 33.2.2 Associates\n\nAssociates  are  all  entities  in  which  the  Group  exercises  a significant  influence  over  the  entity's  management  and financial  policy,  without  exercising  control  or  joint  control. This generally implies holding 20% to 50% of the voting rights.\n\nAssociates  are  recognized  using  the  equity  method  and initially  measured  at  cost,  except  when  the  associates  were previously  controlled  by  the  Group,  in  which  case  they  are measured  at  fair  value  through  the  income  statement  as  of the date control is lost.\n\nSubsequently,  the  share  in  profits  or  losses  of  the  associate attributable  to  the  Group  is  recognized  in  'Share  in  earnings (losses)  of  equity-accounted  companies',  and  the  share  in other  comprehensive  income  of  associates  is  carried  on  a separate  line  of  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income.  If the  Group's  share  in  the  losses  of  an  associate  equals  or exceeds its investment in that associate, the Group no longer recognizes  its  share  of  losses,  unless  it  has  legal  or constructive  obligations  to  make  payments  on  behalf  of  the associate.\n\nGoodwill  related  to  an  associate  is  included  in  the  carrying amount  of  the  investment,  presented  separately  within 'Investments in equity-accounted companies' in the balance sheet.\n\nGains or losses on internal transactions with equity-accounted associates  are  eliminated  in  the  amount  of  the  Group's investment in these companies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, the consideration transferred (acquisition price) is measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  transferred,  equity interests  issued  and  liabilities  incurred  by  the  acquirer  at  the date of exchange. Identifiable assets and liabilities are generally measured  at  their  fair  value  on  the  acquisition  date.  Costs directly  attributable  to  an  acquisition  are  recognized  within other non-recurring operating expenses in the income statement.\n\nThe  excess  of  the  acquisition  price  plus  the  amount  of  any non-controlling interest in the acquiree over the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recognized\n\n## 33.3 Foreign currency translation\n\n## 33.3.1 Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems  included  in  the  financial  statements  of  each  Group entity are valued using the currency of the primary economic environment  in which the entity operates (functional currency).  The  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  are presented in euros, which serves as its presentation currency.\n\n## 33.3.2 Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the entity's functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.\n\nMonetary items (assets and liabilities) in foreign currencies are translated  at  the  closing  exchange  rate  at  the  end  of  each reporting  period.  Any  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses resulting from this translation or from the settlement of these monetary items are recognized within other financial income and expenses in the income statement.\n\nNon-monetary items in foreign currencies valued at historical cost  are  translated  at  the  rate  prevailing  on  the  transaction date, and non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at  fair  value  are  translated  at  the  rate  prevailing  on  the  date the  fair  value  is  determined.  When  a  gain  or  loss  on  a  nonmonetary  item  is  recognized  directly  in  equity  within  other comprehensive  income,  similar  treatment  is  applied  to  the foreign  exchange  component  of  this  gain  or  loss.  Otherwise, the component is recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe treatment of currency hedges in the form of derivatives is described in Note 33.17.\n\nas  goodwill.  If  the  difference  is  negative,  the  gain  on  the bargain  purchase  is  immediately  recognized  in  the  income statement within other non-recurring operating income.\n\nThe  Group  may  choose  to  measure  any  minority  interests resulting  from  each  business  combination  at  fair  value  (full goodwill  method)  or  at  the  proportionate  share  in  the identifiable  net  assets  acquired,  which  are  also  generally measured at fair value (partial goodwill method).\n\nGoodwill is determined at the date of control over the acquired entity is obtained  and  may  not  be  adjusted  after  the measurement period. No additional goodwill is  recognized  on any  subsequent  acquisition  of  minority  interests.  Acquisitions and  disposals  of  minority  interests  are  recognized  directly  in equity attributable to the Group.\n\nThe accounting for a business combination must be completed within 12 months of the acquisition date. This applies to the measurement of identifiable assets and liabilities, consideration transferred and minority interests.\n\n## 33.3.3 Currency translation of foreign subsidiaries' financial statements\n\nThe income statements and balance sheets of Group entities with a functional currency that differs from the presentation currency are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 items recorded in the balance sheet other than equity are translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period;\n- \u00b7 items in the income statement and statement of cash flows are translated at the average exchange rate for the period, corresponding to an approximate value for the rate at the transaction date in the absence of significant fluctuations;\n- \u00b7 translation differences are recognized directly in equity within other  comprehensive  income  as  currency  translation adjustments.\n\nGoodwill  and  fair  value  adjustments  arising  from  a  business combination  with  a  foreign  activity  are  recognized  in  the functional currency of the entity acquired. They are subsequently translated into the Group's presentation currency  at  the  closing  exchange  rate,  and  any  resulting differences  are  recognized  directly  in  equity  within  other comprehensive income as currency translation adjustments.\n\n## 33.3.4 Net investment in a foreign business\n\nCurrency translation adjustments arising on the translation of a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  subsidiary  are  recognized directly in equity within other comprehensive income, and are transferred  to  the  income  statement  on  the  disposal  of  the net investment.\n\nCurrency  translation  adjustments  in  respect  of  foreign currency borrowings designated as hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are recognized directly in equity within other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. They are transferred to the income statement on the disposal of the net investment hedged.",

Each operating segment is monitored separately for internal reporting purposes, according to performance indicators  common  to  all  of  the  Group's  segments.  The segments  presented  are  operating  segments  or  groups  of similar operating segments.\n\nFinancial  information  provided  on  operating  segments  is prepared in accordance with the same accounting rules as in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  performance  of  each  operating  segment  is  measured based on recurring operating income, which is the approach used by the Group's chief operating decision maker.\n\n## 33.5 Revenue\n\nRevenue  mainly  comprises  sales  of  goods,  together  with income from associated  services,  and  income  from  royalties and operating licenses.\n\n## 33.5.1 Sales of goods and associated services\n\nSales  of  goods,  whether  through  a  retail  network,  online  or wholesale operations, are recognized when the Group satisfies its performance obligation to its clients, typically upon delivery.\n\nSales of goods are measured:\n\n- \u00b7 at the fair value of the consideration received;\n- \u00b7 excluding taxes;\n- \u00b7 net of any rebates or discounts;\n- \u00b7 net  of  any  returned  goods,  when  a  wholesaler  has  a contractual  right  of  return  or  routinely  makes  returns,  in which  case  a  specific  provision  is  set  aside.  When  such returns  are  not  contractual,  the  provision  for  returns  is estimated  based  on  historical  data.  Provisions  for  returns are  presented  in  the  balance  sheet  under  liabilities  in respect  of  future  refunds.  An  asset  (with  an  offsetting\n\n## 33.6 Personnel expenses\n\nPersonnel  expenses  primarily  consist  of  wages,  salaries  and payroll  taxes,  expenses  relating  to  pensions  and  other post-employment  benefits  under  defined  benefit  plans  (see Note  33.22),  and  expenses  related  to  share-based  payments (see Note 33.7). Wages, salaries and payroll taxes include fixed remuneration,  variable  short-term  remuneration,  long-term\n\nremuneration plans, expenses related to employee profit-sharing and  other  incentive  plans,  and  any  associated  payroll  taxes. Other  personnel  expenses  notably  include  severance  paid  to individual  employees  or  as  part  of  a  restructuring  plan,  and directors' fees paid to directors of Group entities.\n\nRecurring charges to depreciation, amortization and provisions on non-current operating assets reflect net charges to  depreciation,  amortization  and  provisions  on  intangible assets,  lease  right-of-use  assets  and  property,  plant  and equipment recognized in recurring operating income.\n\nAcquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  correspond  to  gross  non-current  asset  purchases, including  cash  timing  differences,  as  presented  in  the consolidated cash statement.\n\nSegment  assets  comprise  goodwill,  brands  and  other intangible assets, lease right-of-use assets, property, plant and equipment,  other  non-current  assets,  inventories,  trade receivables and other current assets.\n\nSegment liabilities comprise deferred tax liabilities on brands, lease liabilities, trade payables and other current liabilities.\n\nThe  presentation  of  revenue  by  region  is  based  on  the geographic location of clients. Non-current segment assets are not broken down by region since these assets largely consist of  goodwill  and  brands,  which  are  analyzed  based  on  the revenue  generated  in  each  region,  and  not  based  on  their geographic location.\n\n- adjustment corresponding to cost of sales) representing the right to recover the goods from the client is also recognized;\n- \u00b7 in  the  event  of  deferred  payment  beyond  habitual  credit terms  that  is  not  backed  by  a  financing  institution,  the revenue from the sale corresponds to the discounted price. The  difference  between  the  discounted  price  and  the  cash value  is  recognized  under  other  financial  income  and expenses within 'Financial result'.\n\nWarranties in connection with certain product categories are recognized under provisions and have no impact on revenue recognition.\n\nRevenue from services directly related to the sale of goods is recognized in the period in which such services are rendered.\n\n## 33.5.2 Royalties from operating licenses\n\nRoyalties  received  with  respect  to  operating  licenses  are recognized  in  accordance  with  the  contractual  obligations specific  to  each  agreement,  over  time  as  the  performance obligation is satisfied, for example, when calculated based on the  value  of  the  underlying  sales  generated  by  the  licensee under the agreement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  plans  are classified  as  either  cash-settled  plans  or  plans  settled  in Kering shares.\n\nCash-settled  plans  result  in  the  recognition  of  personnel expenses  in  the  income  statement  spread  over  the  rights vesting  period  and  a  matching  liability  in  the  balance  sheet. The  fair  value  of  the  benefit  granted  to  the  beneficiaries  is remeasured  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  taking  into account any changes in market-based or internal performance conditions.\n\nPlans  settled  in  Kering  shares  result  in  the  recognition  of personnel  expenses  in  the  income  statement  spread  over  the rights vesting period and an offsetting entry in equity attributable to  the  Group.  The  fair  value  of  the  benefit  granted  to  the beneficiaries is set at the grant date of the plan using the Black &\n\n## 33.8 Income taxes\n\nIncome  tax  expense  comprises  the  current  and  deferred  tax expense.\n\nDeferred  tax  is  calculated  using  the  liability  method  on  all temporary differences between the carrying amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and the tax value of assets and liabilities, except for goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes  and  certain  other  exceptions.  The  valuation  of deferred tax balances depends on the way in which the Group intends to recover or settle the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using  tax  rates  that  have  been  enacted  or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are presented separately in the balance sheet within non-current assets and liabilities.\n\n## 33.9 Earnings per share\n\nEarnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  net  income attributable to the Group by the weighted average number of outstanding  shares  during  the  period,  i.e.  without  taking account  of  the  weighted  average  number  of  Kering  treasury shares held by the Group during the period.\n\nDiluted  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  adjusting  net income  attributable  to  the  Group  and  the  weighted  average number of outstanding shares during the period for all dilutive instruments  granting  deferred  access  to  the  share  capital  of the  consolidating  company,  whether  issued  by  Kering  or  by one  of  its  subsidiaries.  Dilution  is  determined  separately  for each instrument based on the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 when the proceeds corresponding to potential future share issues are received at the time dilutive securities are issued (e.g.,  convertible  bonds),  the  numerator  is  equal  to  net income  before  dilution  plus  the  interest  expense  that would be saved in the event of conversion, net of tax;\n\n## 33.10 Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is determined according to the method indicated in Note 33.2.3.\n\nGoodwill is allocated as of the acquisition date to cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs defined by the Group. The CGUs or  groups  of  CGUs  to  which  goodwill  has  been  allocated  are\n\nScholes  and  Monte  Carlo  models,  which  take  into  account  the impacts  of  any  market-based  performance  conditions  as  from the  inception  of  the  plan.  The  impacts  of  any  internal-based performance  conditions  are  remeasured  at  the  end  of  each reporting period.\n\nThe payroll taxes relating to these long-term variable remuneration plans are also recognized in personnel expenses in the income statement as the rights under the plans vest, with a matching liability in the balance sheet, regardless of whether the plans are settled in cash or in Kering shares. These payroll taxes are remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the most certain assumptions as regards the outcome of the plans.  Payroll  taxes  relating  to  plans  settled  in  Kering  shares reflect  the  best  estimate  of  the  number  of  shares  to  be delivered upon expiry of the plan at the end of each reporting period.\n\nA  deferred  tax  asset  is  recognized  on  deductible  temporary differences  and  for  tax  loss  and  credit  carry-forwards  to  the extent that their future offset is probable.\n\nA  deferred  tax  liability  is  recognized  on  taxable  temporary differences  relating  to  investments  in  subsidiaries  and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal  of  the  temporary  difference,  and  it  is  probable  that the  temporary  difference  will  not  reverse  in  the  foreseeable future.\n\n- \u00b7 when the proceeds are received at the time the rights are exercised (e.g., issues of free shares), the dilution attached to  the  options  is  determined  using  the  treasury  shares method (theoretical number of shares purchased at market price [average price over the period] based on the proceeds received at the time the rights are exercised).\n\nEarnings per share from continuing operations excluding nonrecurring  items  is  also  calculated  by  adjusting  net  income from continuing operations attributable to the Group for the amount of non-recurring items net of tax. Non-recurring items correspond  to  other  non-recurring  operating  income  and expenses in the income statement (see Note 33.1.5).\n\ntested  for  impairment  each  year,  or  whenever  events  or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss is likely.\n\nCGUs  and  the  related  impairment  tests  are  described  in Note 33.12.",

Software configuration and customization costs are generally expensed over the period of the service.\n\nSoftware developed in-house by the Group and meeting all the relevant criteria is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life, which is generally between three and ten years.\n\nImpairment tests are described in Note 33.12.\n\n## 33.12 Cash-generating units and impairment tests\n\nThe  Group  tests  the  value  of  its  assets  for  impairment  by allocating them to cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs.  The  impairment  tests  are  performed  each  year,  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss is likely. A CGU is the smallest group of assets, including goodwill, that generates cash inflows from continuing  use  that  are  largely  independent  of  the  cash inflows from other assets or CGUs.\n\nCGUs or groups of CGUs as defined by the Group represent the operating  segments  in  which  the  Group's  brands  operate  (see Note 33.4).\n\nImpairment tests seek to determine whether the recoverable amount  of  a  CGU  is  less  than  its  net  carrying  amount.  The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs  to  sell  and  its  value  in  use.  The  value  in  use  is determined  with  respect  to  future  cash  flow  projections, taking into account the time value of money and the specific risks attributable to the asset, CGU or group of CGUs.\n\nFuture  cash  flow  projections  are  based  on  medium-term budgets and plans. These plans are drawn up for a period of five years with the exception of certain CGUs or groups of CGUs\n\n## 33.13 Leases\n\n## 33.13.1 Scope of IFRS 16\n\nA  lease  is  defined  as  a  contract,  or  part  of  a  contract,  that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a given period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nThe Group applies the recognition principles set out in IFRS 16 for all of its leases, with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 short-term leases, with a lease term of 12 months or less as of the commencement date;\n\nundergoing strategic repositioning, for which a longer period may be applied (typically ten years). To calculate value in use, a  terminal  value  equal  to  the  perpetual  capitalization  of  a normative annual cash flow is added to the estimated future cash flows. The perpetual growth rates are appropriate in view of the country mix (the Group now operates in regions whose markets are enjoying faster-paced growth than in Europe), the rise in the cost of raw materials and inflation.\n\nWhen  the  CGU's  recoverable  amount  is  less  than  its  net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment is charged first to goodwill and recognized under 'Other  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses'  in  the income statement (see Note 33.1.3).\n\nImpairment  recognized  in  respect  of  brands  and  other intangible  assets  along  with  property,  plant  and  equipment may be reversed at a later date if there is an indication that the impairment loss no longer exists. Impairment recognized in respect of goodwill may not be reversed.\n\nGoodwill relating to the disposed portion of a CGU is measured on a proportionate basis, except where an alternative method is more appropriate.\n\n- \u00b7 leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, based on the value of the asset when it is new.\n\nLease payments associated with these leases that fall outside the scope of IFRS 16 are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nIf a lease includes explicitly identifiable non-lease components relating  to  services,  those  components  are  recognized  in  the appropriate line item under recurring operating expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  current  and  non-current  portions  of  the  liability  are presented separately. Fixed future lease payments include the  remeasurement  of  any  payments  that  depend  on  an index  or  a  growth  rate  established  in  the  lease.  They  may also include the value of any purchase options or estimated penalties  for  terminating  the  lease,  where  the  Group  is reasonably  certain  to  exercise  these  options.  In  addition, any  lease  incentives  receivable  as  of  the  commencement date are deducted from fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 a  lease  right-of-use  asset,  corresponding  to  the  value  of the  lease  liability  less  any  incentives  received  from  the lessor  and  plus  any  prepaid  lease  payments,  initial  direct costs and the estimated cost of restoring the asset where required by the terms and conditions of the lease.\n\nAfter the commencement date and at each reporting date:\n\n- \u00b7 the lease liability is remeasured as follows:\n- - an increase reflecting the discounting adjustments made over the period depending on the incremental borrowing rate  applied  to  the  lease,  with  a  corresponding  entry  to 'Interest  expense  on  lease  liabilities'  within  'Financial result' in the income statement,\n- - a reduction reflecting the lease payments made over the period,  with  a  corresponding  entry  to  'Cash  and  cash equivalents' in the balance sheet,\n- - an increase reflecting any revisions to the index or growth rate applicable to the lease payments, where appropriate, with a corresponding entry to 'Lease right-of-use assets' in the balance sheet,\n- - an increase or a reduction reflecting the remeasurement of fixed future lease payments further to a change in the estimated  lease  term,  with  a  corresponding  entry  to 'Lease right-of-use assets' in the balance sheet;\n- \u00b7 the lease right-of-use asset is remeasured as follows:\n- - a reduction reflecting the depreciation of the asset on a straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  lease,  with  a corresponding entry to 'Depreciation of lease right-of-use assets'  within  'Recurring  operating  income'  in  the income statement,\n- - a  reduction  reflecting  the  potential  impairment  of  lease right-of-use assets, with a corresponding entry to 'Other non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses'  in  the income statement,\n- - an increase reflecting any revisions to the index or growth rate applicable to the lease payments, where appropriate, with  a  corresponding  entry  to  'Lease  liabilities'  in  the balance sheet,\n- - an increase or a reduction reflecting the remeasurement of  future  lease  payments  further  to  a  change  in  the estimated  lease  term,  with  a  corresponding  entry  to 'Lease liabilities' in the balance sheet.\n\nThe impact of applying IFRS 16 on the income statement can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 within 'Other recurring operating income and expenses', as part of 'Recurring operating income':\n- - variable  lease  payments,  rental  charges  and  payments under  short-term  leases  or  leases  with  a  low-value underlying asset,\n- - straight-line depreciation of lease right-of-use assets;\n- \u00b7 within 'Financial result', the interest expense corresponding to the unwinding of the discount on lease liabilities.\n\nLastly,  the  impact  of  applying  IFRS  16  on  the  statement  of cash flows can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 within  'Net  cash  received  from  operating  activities': variable  lease  payments,  rental  charges  and  payments under  short-term  leases  or  leases  with  a  low-value underlying asset;\n- \u00b7 within 'Net cash used in financing activities': repayments of the principal amount ('Repayment of lease liabilities') and interest  expense  on  lease  liabilities  ('Interest  paid  and equivalent').\n\n## 33.13.3 Estimation of lease terms\n\nThe lease term corresponds to the non-cancelable period for which  a  lessee  has  the  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset, adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; or\n- \u00b7 any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n\nWhen  estimating  the  terms  of  its  real-estate  leases,  which represent the majority of leases signed, the Group divides the underlying assets into two categories:\n\n- \u00b7 points  of  sale:  the  lease  term  corresponds  to  the  initial term  of  the  lease  on  the  signature  date,  namely  without taking into account any extension options, as Kering views the ability to take advantage of opportunities to relocate its stores throughout the term of the lease to be a key part of its  store  network  management  policy.  Over  the  life  of  a lease,  the  Group  reestimates  the  lease  term  at  the  end  of each reporting period, taking into account recent operating decisions  that  factor  in  any  extension  or  termination options that had not been considered reasonably certain at the end of previous reporting periods;\n- \u00b7 other properties (offices, logistics and production centers): the lease term corresponds to the initial term of the lease together with any periods covered by an extension option if Kering is reasonably certain to exercise that option, based on expected future usage of the underlying assets.\n\nIn  the  specific  case  of  '3-6-9'-type  commercial  leases  in France, the Group has adopted nine years as the enforceable lease  term  as  of  the  commencement  of  the  lease,  in accordance  with  the  conclusions  published  by  the  French accounting standard setter (Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables ANC)  in  its  position  statement  of  July  3,  2020  (replacing  the position  statement  of  February  16,  2018).  At  the  end  of  the enforceable lease term and during any subsequent automatic renewal  period  while  renegotiations  are  ongoing,  the  lease term is determined based on the date on which the Group is reasonably certain to renew the lease beyond its contractual term. For certain '6+6'-type commercial leases in Italy, Kering has adopted 12 years as the enforceable lease term as of the commencement of the lease. The position taken by the ANC also applies to Italian leases in the event of automatic renewal during  any  renegotiations  following  the  end  of  their  12-year term.",

        "page_content": "In  accordance  with  the  IFRIC  interpretation  published  on December  16,  2019,  the  Group  estimates  the  term  of  its automatically  renewable  or  indefinite-term  leases  mainly  by reference  to  the  expected  useful  life  of  the  underlying non-movable  assets.  As  a  reminder,  the  Group  depreciates improvements  to  its  stores  and  other  buildings  consistently with the term of the underlying leases. Many different factors are taken  into  account  in  determining  the  maximum depreciation period of leasehold improvements, including the term of the underlying lease.\n\n## 33.13.4 Determination of the discount rate applicable to lease liabilities\n\nThe Group believes that there is no readily available means of determining  the  interest  rates  implicit  in  its  leases  and  has thus elected to apply the incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe  incremental  borrowing  rate  corresponds  to  the  rate  of interest  that  the  Group  would  have  to  pay  to  borrow  over  a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the lease right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.\n\nThe rates applied by the Group are based on a combination of risk-free  interest  rate  curves  per  currency/country,  euro/ foreign  currency  swap  points,  and  the  Group's  credit  spread, also  accounting  for  the  nature  of  the  underlying  asset (property).\n\nAn  'industry'  beta  is  added  to  these  inputs  to  reflect  the specific risk of each activity, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Kering  and  the  principal  Couture  and  Leather  Goods Houses: Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta;\n\n## 33.14 Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  recognized  at  cost  less accumulated depreciation and impairment, with the exception of land, which is not depreciated. The various components of property,  plant  and  equipment  are  recognized  separately when  their estimated useful life and  therefore their depreciation  periods  are  significantly  different.  The  cost  of property, plant and equipment includes the expenses that are directly attributable to its acquisition.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the carrying amount of the asset or recognized  as  a  separate  component,  where necessary, if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow  to  the  Group  and  the  cost  of  the  asset  can  be  reliably measured. All other routine repair and maintenance costs are expensed  in  the  income  statement  in  the  year  they  are incurred.\n\n- \u00b7 Other  Houses  -  Couture  and  Leather  Goods:  Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and Brioni;\n- \u00b7 Other Houses - Watches and Jewelry: Boucheron, Pomellato, Qeelin, Sowind and Ulysse Nardin.\n\nThe rate curves take into account the average lease term and are prepared on a quarterly basis.\n\n## 33.13.5 Lease rights taken into account when calculating lease right-of-use assets\n\nLease rights are a separate component of right-of-use assets and  are  depreciated  over  the  term  of  the  underlying  leases, less  any  residual  value.  This  residual  value  is  tested  for impairment each year and an impairment loss is recognized where necessary.\n\n## 33.13.6 Amendment to IFRS 16 COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions\n\nThe Group chose to apply the practical expedient provided for in the amendment adopted by the IASB on May 28, 2020 and endorsed  by  the  European  Union  on  October  9,  2020,  along with  the  amendment  to  IFRS  16  adopted  by  the  IASB  in March  2021  and  endorsed  by  the  European  Union  in August 2021, extending the period of application of COVID-19related rent concessions to June 30, 2022. This allows lessees to recognize any concessions granted due to the health crisis as negative variable lease payments (i.e. directly in the income statement), without having to assess whether the concessions were  granted  pursuant  to  contractual  or  legal  clauses governing the performance of the lease in question.\n\nDepreciation  is  calculated  using  the  straight-line  method, based  on  the  purchase  price  or  production  cost,  less  any residual  value,  which  is  reviewed  annually  if  considered material, over a period corresponding to the useful life of each asset  category,  i.e.,  10  to  40  years  for  buildings  and improvements to  land  and  buildings,  and  three  to  ten  years for equipment.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  tested  for  impairment when an indication of impairment exists, such as a scheduled closure  of  a  store  or  site,  a  redundancy  plan  or  a  downward revision  of  market  forecasts.  When  an  asset's  recoverable amount is less  than  its  net  carrying  amount,  an  impairment loss  is  recognized.  Where  the  recoverable  amount  of  an individual  asset  cannot  be  determined  precisely,  the  Group determines  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  CGU  or  group  of CGUs to which the asset belongs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There  are three categories of financial assets:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement (profit or loss);\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  in  equity  through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group determines the classification of its financial assets upon initial recognition, based on their characteristics and the management objective behind the asset's purchase. Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the transaction date, which is the date the Group is committed to the  purchase  or  sale  of  the  asset.  A  financial  asset  is derecognized if the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the asset is transferred.\n\n## 33.15.1 Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are carried at amortized cost if they are held as  part  of  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  collect contractual  cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis  category  includes  loans  and  receivables,  deposits  and guarantees,  trade  receivables  and  most  other  current  and non-current receivables.\n\nThese financial assets are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest method.\n\nThe effective interest rate is determined for each transaction and  corresponds  to  the  rate  that  would  provide  the  net carrying  amount  of  the  financial  asset  by  discounting  its estimated  future  cash  flows  until  maturity.  The  calculation includes transaction costs and any premiums  and/or discounts. Transaction costs correspond to the costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset. Net gains  and  losses  on  loans  and  receivables  relate  to  interest income and impairment allowances.\n\nImpairment  allowances  are  recognized  in  the  income statement based on the expected loss model:\n\n- \u00b7 for  its  trade  receivables,  the  Group  applies  a  provision matrix for each country/brand based on historical loss data. Credit  insurance  that  may  be  taken  out  by  the  Group  is taken  into  account  in  the  evaluation  of  the  risk  and therefore of the provision;\n- \u00b7 for  other  financial  assets  measured  at  amortized  cost,  an analysis is carried out taking into account the probability of counterparty default.\n\n## 33.15.2 Financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement\n\nFinancial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  the  income statement  mostly  comprise  financial  assets  giving  rise  to contractual  cash  flows  that  are  not  solely  payments  of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis category includes:\n\n- \u00b7 non-consolidated investments and other financial investments, unless the Group has chosen to carry specific investments  at  fair  value  under  the  fair  value  option,  in which  case  they  are  recognized  directly  in  equity  through other comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7 financial assets held by the Group for trading purposes that the Group intends to resell in the near future and that are part  of  a  portfolio  of  financial  instruments  that  are managed  together  and  for  which  there  is  evidence  of  a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking;\n- \u00b7 assets  designated  as  at  fair  value  under  the  fair  value option.\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  these  assets  are  taken  to  the income  statement.  Net  gains  or  losses  arising  on  financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement generally correspond to interest income, dividends, changes in the  fair  value  of  the  assets  (unrealized  gains  or  losses)  and capital gains or losses on disposals (realized gains or losses).\n\n## 33.15.3 Financial assets measured at fair value in equity through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial  assets  are  carried  at  fair  value  directly  in  equity through other comprehensive income when they are held as part of a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting  contractual  cash  flows  (corresponding  solely  to payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal  amount outstanding) and selling these financial assets.\n\nThis  category  includes  debt  instruments,  such  as  bonds, meeting  the  contractual  cash  flow  and  business  model characteristics set out above.\n\nIt  may  also  include  non-consolidated  investments  or  other financial  investments  such  as  shares  in  investment  funds where  the  Group  has  elected  to  classify  the  shares  in  this category, in which case changes in the fair value of the shares are recognized directly in equity through other comprehensive income  until  the  shares  are  sold,  with  the  exception  of dividends  received  in  respect  of  these  shares,  which  are systematically recognized in the income statement irrespective  of  the  classification  of  the  underlying  financial asset.\n\n## 33.15.4 Fair value hierarchy and associated valuation methods\n\nThe fair  value  of  financial  assets  is  determined  using  one  of three levels in the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: financial assets quoted on an active market;\n- \u00b7 Level  2:  financial  assets  whose  fair  value  is  determined using  valuation  techniques  drawing  on  observable  market inputs;\n- \u00b7 Level  3:  financial  assets  whose  fair  value  is  determined using  valuation  techniques  drawing  on  non-observable inputs (inputs whose value does not result from the price of observable market transactions for the same instrument or from observable market data available as of the end of the reporting period) or inputs which are only partly observable.",

There  are  two categories of financial liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities measured at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 financial  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  through  the income statement (profit or loss).\n\nThe Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities upon initial recognition, based on their characteristics.\n\n## 33.16.1 Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial  liabilities  are  carried  at  amortized  cost  if  they  are held  as  part  of  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to disburse  contractual  cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis category includes borrowings (with the exception of put options granted to minority interests - see Note 33.21), trade payables and most other current and non-current liabilities.\n\nThese financial liabilities are initially  recognized at fair  value less  transaction  costs,  and  subsequently  at  amortized  cost using the effective interest method.\n\nThe effective interest rate is determined for each transaction and  corresponds  to  the  rate  that  would  provide  the  net carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  by  discounting  its estimated  future  cash  flows  until  maturity.  The  calculation includes transaction costs and any premiums  and/or discounts. Transaction costs correspond to the costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability.\n\nThe  net  carrying  amount  of  financial  liabilities  measured  at amortized cost that qualify as hedged items as part of a fair value  hedging  relationship  is  adjusted  with  respect  to  the hedged risk (see Note 33.17.1).\n\n## 33.17 Derivative instruments\n\n## 33.17.1 Derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe  Group  uses  various  derivative  instruments  to  reduce  its exposure  to  foreign  exchange,  interest  rate  and  equity  risk. These instruments are listed on organized markets or traded over the counter with leading counterparties.\n\nDerivative  instruments  are  recognized  in  the  balance  sheet within current or non-current financial assets and current or non-current financial liabilities,  depending  on  their  maturity. They are recognized at fair value as from the transaction date.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives are always recorded in the income statement except in the case of cash flow and net investment hedges.\n\n## 33.16.2 Financial liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement\n\nThe Group may elect to carry some financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement. In this case, unlike in the amortized cost method, the transaction costs associated with setting up these financial liabilities are recognized immediately within  other  financial  income  and  expenses  in  the  income statement.\n\n## 33.16.3 Convertible bonds: separating the debt and equity components\n\nBonds  convertible  into  Kering  shares  have  both  a  standard debt component and an equity component. These bonds are considered  hybrid  instruments  insofar  as  the  conversion option provides for the repayment of the instrument against a fixed number of equity instruments.\n\nTherefore, the two components of a convertible bond are:\n\n- \u00b7 a  debt  component,  recognized  within  bond  debt  and representing the financial liability related to the contractual commitment to pay cash;\n- \u00b7 an  equity  component  corresponding  to  the  option  to convert the bonds into a fixed number of ordinary shares, which resembles a sale of call options by Kering.\n\nThe accounting policies applicable to each of these components,  at  the  issue  date  and  at  the  end  of  each subsequent reporting period, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 debt  component:  the  amount  initially  recognized  as  debt corresponds  to  the  present  value  of  the  future  cash  flows arising  from  interest  and  principal  payments  at  the  market rate for a similar bond with no conversion option. The debt component is subsequently recognized at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 equity  component:  the  value  of  the  conversion  option  is determined  as  the  amount  of  the  issue  less  the  carrying amount  of  the  debt  component.  The  conversion  option continues  to  be  recorded  in  equity  at  its  initial  value. Changes in the value of the option are not recognized;\n- \u00b7 transaction costs are allocated pro rata to each component.\n\nDerivatives  designated  as  hedging  instruments  are  classified by  category  of  hedge  based  on  the  nature  of  the  risks  being hedged:\n\n- \u00b7 a cash flow hedge is used to hedge the risk of changes in future  cash  flow  from  recognized  assets  or  liabilities  or  a highly probable transaction that would impact the income statement;\n- \u00b7 a  fair  value  hedge  is  used  to  hedge  the  risk  of  changes  in the  fair  value  of  recognized  assets  or  liabilities  or  a  firm commitment  not  yet  recognized  that  would  impact  the income statement;\n- \u00b7 a net investment hedge is used to hedge the translation risk arising on operations denominated in foreign currencies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For foreign currency derivatives,  changes  in  the  time  value  of  the  options  and changes in premiums and discounts are also recognized in other comprehensive income. These amounts are reclassified to the  income  statement  to  match  the recognition of the hedged items, mainly in gross margin for the effective portion of commercial transaction hedges, and in  financial  result  for  financial  hedges  and  the  time  value of commercial hedges;\n\n## 33.18 Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net  realizable  value  is  the  estimated  sale  price  in  the normal course of operations, net of costs incurred to complete the sale.\n\nThe  same  method  for  determining  costs  is  adopted  for inventories  of  a  similar  nature  and  use  within  the  Group. Inventories  are  valued  using  the  retail  method  or  weighted average cost method, depending on the Group activity.\n\n## 33.19 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents recorded on the assets side of the balance  sheet  include  cash,  mutual  or  similar  funds,  shortterm investments and other highly liquid instruments that are readily  convertible  to  known  amounts  of  cash,  subject  to  an insignificant  risk  of  changes  in  value,  and  have  a  maximum maturity of three months as of the purchase date.\n\n## 33.20 Kering treasury shares\n\nKering treasury shares, whether specifically allocated for grant to Group employees or allocated to the liquidity agreement or in any other case, as well as directly related transaction costs, are  deducted  directly  from  equity  attributable  to  the  Group.\n\n- \u00b7 for fair value hedges, the hedged component of these items is measured in the balance sheet at fair value with respect to the hedged risk. Fair value gains and losses are recorded in  the  income  statement and are offset, to the extent the hedge  is  effective,  by  simultaneously  matching  fair  value gains and losses on the hedging instrument in the income statement.\n\n## 33.17.2 Derivative instruments designated as trading instruments\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  that  the Group  cannot  or  does  not  wish  to  designate  as  hedging instruments are recognized in full in the income statement in other financial income and expenses within \"Financial result'.\n\n## 33.17.3 Embedded derivative instruments\n\nCertain financial assets or liabilities may contain a derivative instrument.  When  they  are  not  closely  related  to  the underlying  instrument,  these  embedded  derivatives  are recognized  separately  in  the  balance  sheet  as  a  derivative instrument held for trading. Any changes in their fair value are taken  in  full  in  the  income  statement  in  other  financial income and expenses within \"Financial result'.\n\nThe  Group  may  recognize  an  inventory  allowance  based  on expected  turnover,  if  inventory  items  are  damaged,  have become  wholly  or  partially  obsolete,  the  selling  price  has declined,  or  if  the  estimated  costs  to  completion  or  to  be incurred to make the sale have increased.\n\nInvestments  with  a  maturity  exceeding  three  months,  and blocked  or  pledged  bank  accounts,  are  excluded  from  cash and cash equivalents.\n\nBank overdrafts are presented in borrowings on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. In the statement of cash flows, cash and  cash  equivalents  at  the  opening  and  closing  of  the reporting period include bank overdrafts.\n\nOn disposal, the consideration received for these shares, net of  transaction  costs  and  the  related  tax  impacts,  is  also recognized directly in equity attributable to the Group.\n\n## 33.21 Put options granted to minority interests\n\nThe  Group  has  undertaken  to  repurchase  the  minority interests  of  shareholders  of  certain  subsidiaries.  The  strike price of these put options may be set or determined according to a predefined calculation formula, and the options may be exercised at any time or on a specific date.\n\nThe Group recognizes a financial liability in respect of any put options granted to minority interests. This liability is recognized at  the  present  value  of  the  best  estimate  of  the  strike  price, with  an  offsetting  entry  in  equity  attributable  to  the  Group. Any subsequent changes in the liability relating to put options granted to minority interests are recognized directly in equity, including the impact of unwinding the discount.",

        "page_content": "The  financial  liability  recognized  in  respect  of  put  options granted  to  minority  interests  is  shown  in  the  balance  sheet within  current  and  non-current  borrowings,  as  appropriate. Put  options  granted  to  minority  interests  are  therefore included in consolidated net debt (see Note 33.1.3).\n\nDepending  on  the  agreements  signed  by  the  Group  with minority  interests,  minority  shareholders  may  in  some  cases\n\nwaive their dividend rights until the put option is exercised. In this  case,  the  corresponding  minority  interests  are  canceled, with  a  direct  offsetting  entry  in  equity  attributable  to  the Group.  If  the  minority  interests  retain  their  dividend  rights until  the  option  is  exercised  however,  the  minority  interests continue to be shown in the balance sheet.\n\n## 33.22 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nBased on the laws  and  practices  of  each  country,  the  Group recognizes  various  types  of  employee  benefits,  including pensions and other post-employment benefits.\n\nUnder defined contribution plans, the Group is not obliged to make  additional  payments  over  and  above  contributions already made to a fund, if the fund does not have sufficient assets  to  cover  the  benefits  corresponding  to  services rendered  by  personnel  during  the  current  period  and  prior periods.  Contributions  paid  into  these  plans  are  expensed  in the income statement as incurred.\n\nUnder defined benefit plans, obligations are valued using the projected unit credit method based on agreements in effect in each  entity.  Under  this  method,  each  period  of  service  gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is  measured  separately  to  build  up  the  final  obligation.  The obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations vary according to the economic conditions of the country where the plan is established. These plans are valued by independent actuaries on an annual basis. The  valuations  take  into  account  the  level  of  future compensation,  the  probable  active  life  of  employees,  life expectancy and staff turnover.\n\n## 33.23 Provisions\n\nProvisions for litigation, disputes and miscellaneous contingencies and losses are recognized as soon as a present obligation arises from past events, which is likely to result in an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits,  the amount of which can be reliably estimated.\n\nProvisions maturing in more than one year are valued at their discounted  amount,  representing  the  best  estimate  of  the expense necessary to extinguish the current obligation at the end  of  the  reporting  period.  The  discount  rate  used  reflects current assessments of the time value of money and specific risks related to the liability.\n\nThe provision recognized in the balance sheet corresponds to the  present  value  of  the  obligations  calculated  as  described above, less the fair value of the plans' financial assets under wholly funded pension plans.\n\nThe current service cost for these plans is recognized within personnel  expenses  in  the  income  statement.  The  interest cost relating to the benefit obligation net of interest income on  plan  assets  under  wholly  funded  plans  is  recognized  in other financial income and expenses within 'Financial result'. Past  service  cost,  designating  the  increase  in  an  obligation following  the  introduction  of  a  new  plan  or  the  impact  of amendments to an existing plan, is expensed immediately in the  income statement within personnel expenses, regardless of whether or not the benefit entitlement has already vested or is still vesting.\n\nChanges  in  actuarial  assumptions  and  the  impact  of experience  adjustments  (the  difference  between  outcomes estimated using actuarial assumptions and actual outcomes) give  rise  to  actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  are  recognized directly  in  equity  within  other  comprehensive  income.  These actuarial gains and losses are never transferred to the income statement.\n\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognized when there is a  formal  and  detailed  restructuring  plan  and  the  plan  has begun  to  be  implemented  or  its  main  features  have  been announced  before the end of the reporting period. Restructuring costs for which a provision is made essentially represent  employee  costs  (severance  pay,  early  retirement plans,  payment  in  lieu  of  notice,  etc.),  work  stoppages  and compensation for breaches of contract with third parties.\n\n## 33.24 Discontinued operations, assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale\n\nThe  Group  applies  IFRS  5,  which  requires  the  separate recognition  and  presentation  of  assets  (or  disposal  groups) held for sale and discontinued operations.\n\nNon-current assets, or groups of assets and liabilities directly associated with those assets, are considered as held for sale if it is  highly  probable  that  their  carrying  amount  will  be recovered  principally  through  a  sale  rather  than  through continuing use.  Non-current  assets  (or  disposal  groups)  held for sale are measured and recognized at the lower of their net carrying amount and their fair value less the costs of disposal. These  assets  are  no  longer  depreciated  from  the  time  they\n\nqualify  as  assets  (or  disposal  groups)  held  for  sale.  They  are presented on separate lines in the consolidated balance sheet, without restatement for previous periods.\n\nA  discontinued  operation  is  defined  as  a  component  of  a group  that  generates  cash  flows  that  can  be  clearly distinguished  from  the  rest  of  the  Group  and  represents  a separate line of business or geographical area of operations. For all periods presented, the net income or loss from these activities is shown on a separate line of the income statement within  discontinued  operations  and  is  restated  in  the statement of cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie )  for  statutory  auditors,  for  the  period  from  January 1, 2021 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under  specific  conditions.  Indeed,  this  crisis  and  the  exceptional  measures  taken  in  the  context  of  the  state  of  sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group  tests  the  value  of  its  assets  for  impairment  by allocating them to cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs.  The  impairment  tests  are  performed  each  year,  or whenever  events  or  circumstances  indicate  that  an impairment loss is likely. CGUs or groups of CGUs as defined by the Group represent the operating segments in which the Group's brands operate. Impairment tests seek to determine whether the recoverable amount  of  a  CGU  is  less  than  its  net  carrying  amount.  The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs  to  sell  and  its  value  in  use.  The  value  in  use  is | We have examined the compliance of the impairment testing methodology  adopted  by  the  company  with  prevailing accounting  standards.

As  disclosed  in  Note 33.18  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost  is  determined  according  to  the  retail  method  or weighted average cost, depending on the Group business;\n- \u00b7 Net realizable value is the estimated sale price in the normal course of operations, net of costs incurred to complete the sale.\n\nThe  Group  may  recognize  an  inventory  allowance  based  on the expected turnover if inventory items are damaged, if the selling  price  has  declined,  or  if  the  estimated  costs  to completion or to be incurred to make the sale have increased.\n\nThe performance of the Houses, determined by the frequency of collections and turnover of inventory, depends heavily on the  commercial  success  of  product  portfolios  within  each brand of the Group.\n\nGiven the significant amount of inventories in the consolidated assets  land  the  degree  of  judgment  inherent  in  certain assumptions underlying the valuation of inventory depreciation, namely  related  to  sales  or  obsolescence  projections,  we considered this topic to be a key audit matter.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial information statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is included in the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report. Pursuant to Article L. 823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein. A report will be issued on this information by an independent third-party.\n\nOur procedures consisted in:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing the methods used to value inventory depreciation and confirming the consistency of accounting methods;\n- \u00b7 testing the appropriateness of the design and effectiveness of the implementation of the controls set up by Management to  prevent  or  detect  possible  errors  in  the  valuation  of inventory depreciation;\n- \u00b7 assessing the data and assumptions adopted by Management to determine the prospects for inventory turnover and the resulting provisions;\n- \u00b7 assessing  forecast  and  budget  figures  which  may  impact the valuation of inventory depreciation;\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  assumptions  and  implementing  measures used to determine the specific depreciations of inventories.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed statutory auditors of Kering S.A. by the Shareholders' Meeting of June 18, 1992 for KPMG S.A. and May 18, 1994 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, KPMG S.A. was in its 30 th year of uninterrupted engagement and Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s in its 28 th year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and, where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  by  Article  L.823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code (Code  de  commerce) ,  our  statutory  audit  does  not  include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the  related  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or  inadequate,  to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u00b7 Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  statutory  auditor  is  responsible  for  the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  Audit  Committee  with  the  declaration  referred  to  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  Number  537/2014, confirming our independence pursuant to the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors.  Where  appropriate,  we  discuss  with  the  Audit  Committee  the  risks  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, March 7, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\n<!-- image -->",

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method based on the nature and useful life of each component.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are depreciated using the straight-line method and the following useful lives:\n\n| Software                                     | 1 to 5 years   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Internally generated software                | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Improvements to property                     | 10 to 24 years |\n| Technical installations, tools and equipment | 10 to 15 years |\n| Computer equipment                           | 1 to 10 years  |\n| Office furniture                             | 10 years       |\n\n## 2.2 Long-term investments\n\n## Investments\n\nSecurities  classified  as  'Investments'  are  those  considered necessary  for  the  Company's  activities,  particularly  because they provide the Company with influence over, or control of, the issuer.\n\nPursuant to notice no. 2007-C issued by the Emerging Issues Taskforce  of  the  French  accounting  standards  authority (Conseil National de la Comptabilit\u00e9 - CNC) on June 15, 2007, the Company elected to recognize acquisition fees as part of the cost of investments.\n\nAs  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  gross  amount  of investments is compared to their value in use to the Company, determined  with  reference  to  the  subsidiary's  estimated economic value and taking into consideration the purpose of the  original  transaction.  Value  in  use  is  determined  using  a multi-criteria approach based on future cash flow projections, the revised asset value, the share of consolidated or revalued shareholders' equity, and other methods.\n\nAn impairment loss is recorded when this value falls below the gross value.\n\n## Other long-term investments\n\nOther  long-term  investments  include  other  investments  and certain treasury shares.\n\n## Other investments (excluding treasury shares)\n\nOther investments are investments that the Company plans or is  required  to  hold  on  a  long-term  basis,  but  which  are  not deemed necessary for the Company's activities.\n\nThe  gross  amount  of  these  investments  is  equal  to  the acquisition cost plus any related acquisition fees.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized based on the value in use of these securities to the Company.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares  acquired  under  liquidity  agreements  are recorded under 'Other long-term investments\". These shares are written  down  where  necessary  to  reflect  the  average  share price over the last month of the fiscal year.\n\nTreasury  shares  acquired  for  the  express  purpose  of  being used  in  a  future  capital  reduction  are  also  classified  under 'Other  long-term  investments\".  These  shares  are  not  written down to reflect the share price.\n\n## 2.3 Receivables\n\nReceivables  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  nominal  value  and  are  written  down  where  they  present  a  risk  of non-recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->",

No impairment is recognized on treasury shares to reflect the share price.\n\n## Other shares\n\nShares are recorded at their acquisition cost. An impairment loss  is  recognized  when  their  closing  price  falls  below  their carrying amount.\n\n## Bonds\n\nBonds are recorded on the acquisition date at their par value adjusted for any premium or discount. Accrued interest as of the acquisition date and as of the end of the reporting period is recorded in an accrued interest account.\n\nAs of the end of the reporting period, the cost of the bonds is compared to  the  market  value  of  the  principal  over  the  last month of the year, excluding accrued interest. An impairment loss is recorded when this value falls below the gross value.\n\n## 2.5 Financial instruments\n\nAll  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  positions  are  taken  via instruments  listed  on  exchange-traded  or  over-the-counter markets  representing  minimal  counterparty  risk.  Any  gains  or losses  generated  on  financial  instruments  used  in  hedging transactions are offset against the corresponding gain or loss on the hedged items.\n\nWhere  financial  instruments  do  not  qualify  as  hedges,  any gains  or  losses  resulting  from  changes  in  their  market  value are  recorded  in  the  income  statement,  except  for  over-thecounter  transactions.  For  these  transactions,  a  provision  is recorded for any unrealized losses, while unrealized gains are not recognized.\n\nANC Regulation no. 2015-05 of July 2, 2015, concerning forward financial instruments  and  hedges,  came  into  force  on January  1,  2017  but  was  not  applicable  to  the  Company's transactions during fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe accounting principles are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the  principle  of  symmetrically  offsetting  the  realized  and unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  hedging  instruments  with those of their underlying assets in the income statement is applied across the board:\n- - hedge accounting is not optional,\n- - as  regards  foreign  exchange  rate  risk,  non-derivative instruments  such  as  borrowings  or  cash  deposits denominated  in  a  foreign  currency  may  now  qualify  as hedging\n\n## Mutual funds (Sicav)\n\nShares in mutual funds are recorded at their acquisition cost excluding  subscription  fees,  and  their  net  asset  value  is estimated as of the end of the reporting period. A provision for impairment  is  recorded  in  respect  of  any  unrealized  capital losses. No unrealized capital gains are recognized.\n\n## Negotiable certificates of deposit, certificates of deposit and notes issued by financing companies\n\nNegotiable  debt  securities  are  subscribed  on  the  primary market  or  purchased  on  the  secondary  market.  They  are recorded  at  acquisition  cost  less  accrued  interest  as  of  the acquisition date when purchased on the secondary market.\n\nPrepaid  interest  is  recognized  as  financial  income  on  a proportional basis for the fiscal year.\n\n- \u00b7 hedging  instruments:  changes  in  the  value  of  hedging instruments  are  not  recognized  on  the  balance  sheet, unless their full or partial recognition offsets gains or losses in the underlying asset;\n- \u00b7 underlying asset: a derivative may be an underlying asset;\n- \u00b7 isolated open positive derivatives:\n- - recognition on the balance sheet of changes in value and provisions  for  unrealized  losses  for  all  derivatives  not recognized as hedging instruments,\n- - detail  on  calculations  used  to  determine  provisions  on currency  positions  (currency  by  currency,  the  maturity dates of the elements included in the position must be included in the same fiscal year).",

Under this method, each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is  measured  separately  to  build  up  the  final  obligation.  The obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to  determine  the  obligations  vary  depending  on  economic conditions.\n\nThese  benefit  obligations  are  assessed  by  independent actuaries on an annual basis.

The tax savings\n\nFor convertible bonds, the redemption premium is recognized over the term of the bond, in accordance with the benchmark accounting treatment.\n\nIn the case of an indexed bond issue, a contingency provision must  be  recorded  in  respect  of  redemption  when  the estimated  amount  required  to  redeem  the  bonds  as  of  the end of the reporting period exceeds the amount of the issue. This  provision  is  calculated  on  a  proportional  basis  over  the term of the bond.\n\nthe  level  of  future  compensation,  the  probable  active  life  of employees, life expectancy and staff turnover.\n\nKering applies the notice relating to CRC regulation no. 200815 of December 4, 2008 on the accounting treatment of stock option and employee free share plans.\n\nThe application of the update to recommendation no. 201302  of  November  7,  2013  on  the  rules  for  measuring  and recognizing retirement benefit obligations and similar benefits  in  French  GAAP  single-company  and  consolidated financial  statements  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on Kering SA's obligations.\n\ngenerated  by  the  Group  as  a  result  of  tax  consolidation  are retained  by  Kering  SA  as  the  parent  company  of  the  tax consolidation group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The latest agreement was  signed  on  February  13,  2019,  in  accordance  with  AMF ruling no. 2018-01  of  July  2,  2018,  applicable  since January 1, 2019. An amendment to that agreement came into force  on  July  1,  2021,  providing  for  the  resources  in  the liquidity  account  to  be  reduced  by  \u20ac25  million.  As  a  result, there was \u20ac25 million in the liquidity account on July 1, 2021.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Kering held no shares in treasury under the liquidity agreement.\n\n## Stock repurchase program\n\nAs part of the repurchase program announced on August 25, 2021, through which it intends to repurchase up to 2.0% of its share  capital  over  a  24-month  period,  Kering  set  up  a  stock repurchase  agreement  with  an  investment  services  provider. The agreement, relating to an initial tranche of up to 650,000 shares, i.e. around 0.5% of the share capital, subject to a limit of \u20ac650 million and a price per share of no more than \u20ac1,000, which  was  determined  by  the  sole  resolution  adopted  by shareholders in the July 6, 2021 AGM.\n\nOn December 9, the Group completed the first tranche of the stock  repurchase  program  that  it  announced  on  August  25, 2021.  Between  August  25  and  November  3,  2021,  650,000 shares  were  repurchased  at  an  average  price  of  \u20ac643.70  per share, i.e. for a total of \u20ac418.4 million.\n\nOf the shares repurchased in that first tranche, 325,000 were canceled.  Accordingly,  the  share  capital  was  reduced  by \u20ac1,300,000.  The  total  purchase  price  of  the  canceled  shares was  \u20ac209,203,953.83,  which  was  allocated  to  the  following accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac1,300,000 to 'Share capital';\n- \u00b7 \u20ac207,903,953.83 to 'Retained earnings'.\n\nThe  remaining  repurchased  shares  were  used  to  cover  free share plans for the Group's employees.\n\n## NOTE 4 - PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nMovements in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are presented below:\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                           | Intangible assets   | Property, plant and equipment   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| GROSS VALUE                               |                     |                                 |         |\n| December 31, 2020                         | 387.1               | 99.3                            | 486.4   |\n| Acquisitions                              | 127.4               | 5.9                             | 133.3   |\n| Reclassifications                         | 47.4                | (47.4)                          | 0.0     |\n| Other movements                           | 0.0                 | (0.0)                           | 0.0     |\n| Disposals / retirements                   | (136.2)             | (11.0)                          | (147.2) |\n| December 31, 2021                         | 425.7               | 46.8                            | 472.5   |\n| DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND PROVISIONS |                     |                                 |         |\n| December 31, 2020                         | (96.4)              | (22.6)                          | (119.0) |\n| Additions                                 | (60.8)              | (4.0)                           | (64.8)  |\n| Reversals on disposals                    | 63.6                | 10.9                            | 74.5    |\n| December 31, 2021                         | (93.6)              | (15.7)                          | (109.3) |\n| CARRYING AMOUNT                           |                     |                                 |         |\n| December 31, 2020                         | 290.7               | 76.7                            | 367.4   |\n| December 31, 2021                         | 332.1               | 31.1                            | 363.2   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \"Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2021 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1, of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under  specific  conditions.  Indeed,  this  crisis  and  the  exceptional  measures  taken  in  the  context  of  the  state  of  sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.",

Value in use is determined using a multi- criteria approach based on future cash flow projections and the share of consolidated or revalued shareholders' equity. Other methods are used when necessary.  An  impairment  loss  is  recorded  when  this  value | ensuring that the net carrying amounts of the investments are  below  to  their  value  in  use,  taking  into  account  the share  of  consolidated  or  revalued  shareholders'  equity, cash  flows  projections,  latest  available  forecasted information, and the profitability outlook; \u00b7 verifying the calculation of revalued shareholders' equity. |\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information presented in the Management Report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to shareholders.\n\nWe  attest  the  fair  presentation  and  the  consistency  with  the  financial  statements  of  the  information  relating  to  payment deadlines mentioned in Article D.441-64 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n## Information relating to corporate governance\n\nWe attest  that  the  section  of  the  management  report  devoted  to  corporate  governance  sets  out  the  information  required  by Articles Article L. 225-37-4, L.22-10-10 and L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to remunerations and benefits received by or awarded to the members of the Board of Directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from controlled enterprises included in the scope of consolidation.

Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.  823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce ),  our  statutory  audit  does  not  include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\n- 424",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L.  822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  and  in  the  French  Code of Ethics for statutory auditors.

This  program specifies  a  maximum  purchase  price  of  \u20ac600  per  share  and states that the number of shares purchased may not exceed 10% of the share capital.\n\nThe  authorization  given  to  the  Board  of  Directors  to  trade  in Company shares for a period of 18 months was renewed at the Annual General Meeting of April 22, 2021 under the fourteenth resolution  (maximum  purchase  price  of  \u20ac700  per  share),  and then at the Ordinary General Meeting of July 6, 2021, in which the maximum purchase price was increased to \u20ac1,000 per share in view of the continuous rise in the Company's share price and the fact that in May 2021 it rose above the maximum purchase price set in the April 22, 2021 AGM.\n\nThe  objectives  that  could  be  pursued  are  defined  in  the corresponding resolution and include the cancellation by the Company  of  its  own  shares,  the  allotment  of  shares  to  the Company's employees or corporate officers within the scope of free share or stock purchase option plans, ensuring liquidity and maintaining the Company's share price under a liquidity agreement  or  retaining  the  shares  and,  where  applicable, selling,  transferring  or  exchanging  them  in  external  growth transactions.\n\n## Liquidity agreement\n\nSince May 26, 2004, Kering has maintained agreements with a financial broker in order to improve the liquidity of the Group's shares and ensure share price stability. The latest agreement was  signed  on  February  13,  2019,  in  accordance  with  AMF ruling no. 2018-01  of  July  2,  2018,  applicable  since\n\nJanuary 1, 2019. An amendment to that agreement came into force  on  July  1,  2021,  providing  for  the  resources  in  the liquidity  account  to  be  reduced  by  \u20ac25  million.  As  a  result, there was \u20ac25 million in the liquidity account on July 1, 2021.\n\nDuring 2021, Kering purchased 115,344 shares for an amount of \u20ac72.1 million, representing an average price of \u20ac625.30 per share.

Its actions  are  targeted  and  customized  to  offer  different audiences - private individual shareholders and the financial community - messages suited to their respective expectations while  complying  with  the  principle  of  equal  access  to information.\n\n## Towards individual shareholders\n\nPrivate individual shareholders have access to various media and tools to keep themselves informed about the Group and events  affecting  its  shares.  These  include  the  twice-yearly Letter  to  Shareholders,  the  Shareholders'  Guide  (available online, in French only), the shareholders' hotline (+33 1 45 64 65 64) and email address (actionnaire@kering.com), financial notices in the press and online, the Group's website, and the annual report.\n\n## Towards the financial community\n\nThe Group maintains close relationships with the French and international financial community. A number of initiatives are designed to keep the financial community informed about its\n\nbusinesses,  strategy  and  outlook.  Kering  has  expanded  its communication  by  organizing  conference  calls  upon  the release of quarterly revenue, half-year and annual results, as well  as  participating  in  industry  conferences  held  by  major banks.  All  of  the  presentation  material  is  available  on  the Group's  website.  Kering  also  meets  with  investors  during roadshows  held  in  the  major  financial  centers  around  the world  (in  both  2020  and  2021,  Kering  replaced  in-person investor roadshows with virtual events).\n\nIn  addition,  at  the  initiative  of  its  Board  of  Directors,  the Company  continued  to  strengthen  dialogue  with  investors, particularly  on  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG) issues.  With  this  in  mind,  in  December  2021  the  Lead Independent  Director,  with  the  participation  of  the  Board Secretary,  the  Chief  Sustainability  Officer,  the  Financial Communications  Department  as  well  as  the  Chief  Financial Officer,  organized  a  roadshow  dedicated  to  ESG  matters, virtually  meeting  with  a  number  of  investors  (representing around 46% of the free float).\n\nThe  presentation  used  at  the  roadshow  is  available  on  the Company's website.\n\nThe  Group  meets  with  investors  and  analysts  upon  request and maintains proactive relationships in terms of reporting to the French Financial Market Authority (AMF).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This information is filed with the AMF at the time of its disclosure and stored on the Kering website.\n\nFull and effective communication is carried out electronically in  compliance with the criteria defined by the AMF's General Regulations, which require communication to a wide audience within the European Union and under conditions guaranteeing the security of the communication  and information.  Accordingly,  Kering's  Financial  Communications Department  has  chosen  to  work  with  a  professional communications agency satisfying the communication criteria set by EU Regulation No. 596/2014 on market abuse and the AMF's  General  Regulations.  The  communications  agency  is included  on  the  list  published  by  the  AMF,  thus  benefiting from a presumption of full and effective communication.\n\n## 2022 shareholders' agenda\n\n| April 21, 2022 (after market close)   | First-quarter revenue   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| April 28, 2022                        | Annual General Meeting  |\n| July 2022 (1)                         | First-half results      |\n| October 2022 (1)                      | Third-quarter revenue   |\n\n- (1) The specific date will be posted on Kering.com.",

The  term  was  extended  to  May  26,  2066  at  the Extraordinary General Meeting held on May 26, 1967, except in the case of an early dissolution or of an extension approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\n## Corporate purpose\n\nThe Company's corporate purpose is:\n\n- \u00b7 the  purchase,  retail  sale  or  wholesale,  either  directly  or indirectly,  by  all  means  and  using  all  existing  or  future techniques, of all goods, products, commodities or services;\n- \u00b7 the  creation,  acquisition,  leasing,  operating  or  sale,  either directly  or  indirectly,  of  all  establishments,  stores  or warehouses,  by  all  means  and  using  all  existing  or  future techniques,  for  the  retail  sale  or  wholesale  of  all  goods, products, commodities or services;\n- \u00b7 the direct or indirect manufacture of all goods, products or commodities that are useful for corporate operations;\n- \u00b7 the direct or indirect supply of all services;\n- \u00b7 the  purchase,  operation  and  sale  of  all  buildings  that  are useful for corporate operations;\n- \u00b7 the creation of all commercial, non-trading, industrial and financial  concerns,  whether  in  moveable  or  real  property, service or other businesses, the acquisition of participating interests by all means, subscriptions, acquisitions, contributions, mergers or other transactions involving such concerns  and  businesses  and  the  management  of  its participating interests;\n- \u00b7 and, in general, all commercial, non-trading, industrial and financial operations, whether in moveable or real property, service or other businesses that can be directly or indirectly connected to the purposes specified above or to all similar, complementary  or  related  purposes  or  purposes  that  are liable to favor the creation or development thereof.\n\n(Article 5 of the Articles of Association)\n\n## Trade and Companies Registry\n\n552 075 020 RCS Paris\n\nAPE code: 7010Z\n\n## Consultation of legal documents\n\nThe  Articles  of  Association,  minutes  of  Annual  General Meetings and other corporate documents may be consulted at the registered office under the applicable legal conditions.\n\n## Fiscal year\n\nThe  Company's  fiscal  year  begins  on  January  1  and  ends  on December 31 of the same year.\n\n## Appropriation of earnings\n\nFrom the profit for the fiscal year, less deferred losses where applicable, a minimum withdrawal of one-twentieth is made and paid into a reserve fund known as the 'legal reserve'. Said withdrawal ceases to be mandatory once said reserve reaches one-tenth of the share capital.\n\nFrom the distributable profit, which is made up of the profit for the fiscal year less the deferred losses and the withdrawal referred to above, as well as the amounts to be paid into the reserves in accordance with the law, plus deferred profits, the Annual General Meeting, pursuant to a proposal by the Board of Directors, may withdraw all amounts it deems appropriate, either  to  be  deferred  to  the  subsequent  fiscal  year,  or  to  be entered  into  one  or  more  extraordinary,  general  or  special reserve funds, the allocation and use of which is determined by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe balance, if any, is allocated among the shareholders.\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  that  votes  on  the  financial statements for the fiscal year has the option of granting each shareholder, for all or part of the dividend or interim dividend distributed, an option between payment of the dividend or the interim  dividend  in  cash,  in  kind  or  in  shares.  The  Annual General Meeting may also decide, for all or part of the dividend, interim dividends, reserves, or premiums distributed, or for any capital reduction, that the distribution of dividends, reserves or premiums or the capital reduction will be made in kind in the form of corporate assets, including securities.\n\n(Article 21 of the Articles of Association)\n\nDividends not claimed after five years are paid to the French State.\n\nDividends paid over the last three fiscal years are presented in the Management Report.",

Proof  of  a  shareholder's  capacity  can  be provided  electronically,  under  the  conditions  set  by  the regulations  in  force.  Pursuant  to  a  decision  of  the  Board  of Directors,  shareholders  may  participate  in  meetings  via videoconference or via telecommunications means that make it possible to identify them under the conditions laid down by the  regulations  in  force.  All  shareholders  may  vote  by correspondence  using  a  form  filled  out  and  sent  to  the Company under the conditions laid down by the regulations in force,  including  electronically,  pursuant  to  a  decision  by  the Board  of  Directors.  This  form  must  reach  the  Company  in accordance with the regulatory conditions in order to be taken into  account.  The  Board  of  Directors  may  reduce  said timeframe  for  the  benefit  of  all  shareholders.  Owners  of securities  who  are  not  resident  on  French  territory  may  be represented by an intermediary who  is  registered in accordance with the conditions laid down by the regulations in force.\n\nMeetings  are  chaired  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors or, in his/her absence, by the member of the Board who  is  specifically  appointed  for  this  purpose  by  the  Board. Failing this, the meeting elects its own chair.\n\nMeeting minutes are prepared and copies thereof are certified and issued in accordance with the law.\n\nIn  all  Annual  General  Meetings,  a  voting  right  that  is  double that conferred on the other shares is granted to all shares that are  fully  paid  up  and  for  which  proof  is  provided  that  they have been held in registered form for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder. This double voting right, which existed in the Articles of Association of Pinault SA prior to its merger with Printemps SA, was restated at  the  time  of  their 1992 merger.\n\nThis  double  voting  right  may  be  withdrawn  outright  at  any time  pursuant  to  a  decision  of  the  Extraordinary  General Meeting  and  after  ratification  by  a  special  meeting  of  the beneficiary shareholders.\n\n(Article 19 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThe double voting right existed in Pinault SA and Printemps SA prior  to  their  1992  merger.  The  Company's  Articles  of Association  do  not  provide  that,  in  the  event  of  a  free allocation of registered shares to a shareholder in respect of old shares for which he/she/it had a double voting right, the new shares are also entitled to a double voting right.\n\nPursuant to the relevant  legislation,  double  voting  rights  are canceled for any share converted to a bearer share or in the event  of  a  transfer  of  ownership  except  in  the  case  of  a transfer  following  inheritance,  liquidation  of  joint  property between spouses, or donation between living family members (spouse or relative) with legal inheritance rights.\n\nVoting rights are not limited under the Articles of Association.\n\n## Provisions of the Articles of Association relating to shareholder notifications\n\nThe  shares  shall  be  in  registered  or  bearer  form  at  the shareholder's discretion. The shares shall be entered into an account  under  the  conditions  and  in  accordance  with  the terms provided for by the regulations in force.\n\nThe  Company is  authorized  to  use  the  provisions  of  the  law and regulations regarding the identification of the holders of securities  that  grant  immediate  or  deferred  access  to  voting rights at its own Annual General Meetings.\n\nIn addition to the legal obligations to notify the Company and the  French  financial  markets  authority  ( Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s financiers -  AMF)  when  shareholdings  reach  or  fall  below  a given  threshold,  any  individual  or  legal  entity  directly  or indirectly  holding  shares  in  the  Company,  whether  acting alone  or  in  concert,  shall  notify  the  Company  of  the  total number  of  shares  and  voting  rights  held  if  said  number reaches  or  exceeds  2%  or  any  multiple  thereof,  including multiples  exceeding  the  legal  threshold  of  5%.  Notifications shall be made by registered letter with return receipt sent to the  registered  office  no  later  than  15  days  after  the  date  on which the threshold was crossed or reached, or by any other equivalent  means  for  shareholders  not  residing  in  France,  it being  specified  that  the  contents  of  the  notification  must comply with the legal and regulatory provisions applicable to shareholder  notifications  concerning  legal  thresholds,  and must  include  the  information  to  be  provided  in  such circumstances to the AMF, as stated in its General Regulations. The same notification obligation shall apply under the same conditions  when  a  shareholder's  total  shares  and/or  voting rights  reach  or  fall  below  any  of  the  aforementioned thresholds.\n\nIf  the  notification is not submitted, the shares exceeding the threshold for which the notification should have been made may be deprived of voting rights at the request of one or more shareholders  holding  a  combined  or  individual  total  of  at least 5% of the Company's share capital and/or voting rights, under the conditions set forth in the sixth paragraph of Article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code. If the notification is subsequently made, the corresponding voting rights may not be  exercised  until  the  period  of  time  defined  by  law  or  the prevailing regulations has expired.\n\n(Article 7 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThere are no shares not representing capital.\n\nThe  steps  required  to  amend  shareholder  rights  are  those provided for by law.\n\n<!-- image -->",
