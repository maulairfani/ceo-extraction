        "page_content": "## Chair's introduction\n\n## Performance\n\nUnilever's operating performance improved in 2021, with the company recording its fastest year-on-year underlying sales growth for nine years, at 4.5%. Underlying operating profit also increased, by 2.9%. This represented a good outcome in what were unusually difficult trading conditions. Spiralling cost inflation presented the biggest challenge and impacted underlying operating margin, which was down 10bps, although the company's determined response in landing customer price increases certainly helped to limit the impact. This ability to raise prices in a tough, inflationary environment is testament to the strength and quality of Unilever's brands.\n\nUnilever's business is benefiting from the focus and investment being put behind its five Compass strategic choices - see pages 8 to 9. The Board was particularly encouraged to see Unilever's top 13 brands - each with a turnover in excess of \u20ac1 billion - grow in aggregate last year by 6.4%, well above the company average. These brands account for 50% of Unilever's total turnover. The focus behind key long-term growth markets is also driving improved results, with strong performances last year in the US, India and China. Together, these markets now represent 36% of Unilever's turnover.\n\nThe good operating performance in 2021 was the main driver of earnings growth, with earnings per share (EPS) up by 5.5%.\n\nFollowing the completion of the programme to buy back shares with an aggregate market value equivalent to \u20ac3 billion, the company announced a further \u20ac3 billion programme of share buybacks, which we expect to see completed over 2022 and 2023.\n\n## Portfolio\n\nThe Board is convinced that the continued evolution of Unilever's portfolio into higher growth spaces is key to accelerating the company's long-term growth profile and in delivering enhanced value to shareholders. To that end, unifying the Group's legal structure in 2020 was an important milestone in allowing the Board to consider a wider range of strategic options, including scope for larger and more transformative acquisitions.\n\nIt was in this context that the Board viewed a possible acquisition of GSK Consumer Health as one route to accelerate Unilever's presence in a very attractive part of the market. However, while there was some recognition among shareholders of the strategic merits of pursuing such a move, many voiced their strong opposition to the size and timing of such a deal. Consequently, and having listened closely to shareholder concerns, the Board and management of the company have made clear that we do not intend to pursue similar large-scale acquisitions in the foreseeable future.\n\nInstead, the focus will be on improving Unilever's value creation through accelerated organic growth - driven by the five Compass strategic choices. We will also continue to strengthen the portfolio through the kind of bolt-on acquisitions that have enabled Unilever to build fast-growing businesses in Prestige beauty and Functional nutrition. As part of strengthening the portfolio, last year we announced the sale\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof Unilever's Tea business, for \u20ac4.5 billion, which is expected to complete in the second half of 2022. Selective disposals of brands and assets will continue to play a role going forwards.\n\nThe Board also expects the new organisation to support growth over the coming years. Having reviewed the changes, the Board is confident they will help make Unilever a simpler, faster and more accountable business, and at lower cost.\n\n## Board composition and succession\n\nDuring the year, the Board appointed Adrian Hennah and Ruby Lu as independent Non-Executive Directors, both appointments took effect from 1 November 2021. Adrian joined the Board after a long and successful executive career, most recently in the consumer goods sector. Adrian's extensive financial experience, gained from CFO positions with leading UK-based businesses, together with his deep industry knowledge, is a major asset to the Board. The Board will also benefit enormously from Ruby Lu's appointment. Ruby is a venture capitalist with a long and successful track record of investing in start-up businesses in China and the US, markets she knows very well.\n\nFollowing the 2021 AGM, Youngme Moon stood down from her role as Senior Independent Director (SID). I want to thank Youngme for the valuable contribution she made in that role. Equally, I am delighted that Andrea Jung was appointed to succeed Youngme as SID. Andrea also took over as Chair of the Compensation Committee, in February 2021, when Vittorio Colao stepped down from the Board to join the Italian government as Minister for Technological Innovation and Digital Transition.",

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank them for their much-valued contribution to Unilever.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nTackling climate change is a key priority for the Group and we were pleased to put our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) to shareholders for an advisory vote at the 2021 AGM. The plan sets out our climate strategy, defines our net zero and emission reduction goals, and sets out the actions we intend to take to meet them. The plan also describes how the company is integrating climate change considerations into its products and brands, as well as the role that advocacy and partnership can play in meeting goals. This was the first time a global company of our size voluntarily put its climate transition plans before a shareholder vote, and we were delighted to see it receive overwhelming backing, with over 99% of shareholders voting in favour. Work remains to be done but we do believe that the CTAP can help Unilever make an important contribution to tackling climate change while growing our brands. Read more about our progress in the CTAP Progress Report on pages 51 to 56.\n\nRegular Board evaluation is an important element in maintaining high standards of corporate governance and Board effectiveness. In 2021, the Board conducted a thorough internal evaluation exercise. The results, which were reviewed at the November 2021 Board meeting, confirmed that the Board continues to perform effectively and with a high degree of Director engagement.\n\nIn addition to our six planned Board meetings, three additional meetings were held in 2021 to consider the Group's portfolio and the growth opportunities within it. Non-Executive Directors also attended 14 virtual employee engagement events during the year across a wide range of the workforce. In addition, Andrea Jung attended a global town hall webcast in July 2021, providing an opportunity for all employees to engage with one of our Board members.\n\nThe evaluation and Board engagements also re-affirmed the Board's focus on growth and portfolio strategy evolution as keys to unlocking value in Unilever.\n\nFurther detail on the evaluation process this year, together with the Board's remit, operations and the topics regularly discussed by the Board can be found in the Governance section on pages 67 to 83.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nDuring 2021, we continued to consult with shareholders on our Remuneration Policy and were pleased at the 2021 AGM to receive your strong support for the implementation of a reward framework based on a new Performance Share Plan, delinked from the annual bonus. The new Policy seeks to improve the overall effectiveness of Unilever's incentives by helping drive sustainable long-term growth and enabling the Compensation Committee to set stretching but achievable performance targets over realistic timeframes. Further information on the Policy can be found on page 84.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nTrading conditions will undoubtedly be challenging throughout 2022 as the world continues to come through the effects of the Covid pandemic and all the consequent economic aftershocks - and in particular, extraordinarily high levels of cost inflation. Unilever is well prepared to meet these challenges through a combination of customer prices and the delivery of cost savings, which will help to mitigate inflationary impacts on the business. Moreover, the company enters 2022 with good momentum, and with a clear set of strategic choices that the Board is confident will help deliver another positive year of top-line growth for Unilever.\n\nAgainst a particularly challenging backdrop, Unilever delivered a good set of results for 2021. This could not have been achieved without the efforts of the 148,000 people who make up this great company, some of whom it was a privilege to spend time with over the last year, albeit in most cases virtually. Their hard work, ingenuity and integrity have once again shone through and on behalf of the Board, I want to thank them for everything they have done, and continue to do, for Unilever. I also want to thank and acknowledge our shareholders and other stakeholders for their continued support.\n\n## Section 172 statement\n\nUnder Section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 ('Section 172') directors must act in the way that they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of their company. In doing so, our Directors must have regard to stakeholders and the other matters set out in Section 172. Pages 63 and 69 to 71 comprise our Section 172 statement. Page 63 of our Strategic Report identifies our key stakeholders and provides examples of how the business engaged them during 2021, with cross references to the stakeholder review section for more detail. Pages 69 to 71 of our Governance Report details how our Directors have taken steps to understand the needs and priorities of these stakeholders when setting Unilever's strategy and taking decisions concerning the business, including by direct engagement or via their delegated committees and forums. The relevance of each stakeholder group may vary depending on the matter at hand.",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive Officer's review\n\n## Context\n\n2021 was another turbulent year for the world economy and for global markets. Output rebounded strongly, if unevenly, after the sharp Covid-related declines of 2020. However, surging demand, triggered by significant fiscal and monetary stimulus, gave rise to widespread labour shortages, supply bottlenecks and soaring energy costs, stoking significant inflationary pressures.\n\nFor Unilever, this steep rise in input cost inflation was one of the defining features of the year, impacting each of our product categories.\n\n## Performance 2021\n\nAgainst this challenging backdrop, we delivered a strong set of results in 2021. Underlying sales growth of 4.5% represented Unilever's fastest year-on-year growth in nine years, well into the upper end of our 3-5% multi-year framework. We responded to rising input costs with pricing actions, delivering underlying price growth of 2.9% for the year. While never easy, raising customer prices in response to inflationary pressures is vital and necessary if we are to preserve our ability to invest in Unilever's brands. Underlying volume growth for the full year was 1.6%.\n\nGrowth was broad-based, with each of our three global Divisions - Beauty & Personal Care, Foods & Refreshment and Home Care - performing well. Growth was also competitive. We ended the year with 53% of the business winning market share by value, a second consecutive year of competitive growth and a marked improvement in our competitive performance from just a few years ago.\n\nWhile top-line growth remains the number one priority, margin progression is also an important component of value creation. Underlying operating margin for the year was 18.4%, down 10bps on the previous year. Although pricing stepped up, it wasn't enough to fully offset the impact of inflation across our raw materials, packaging and distribution costs.\n\nFree Cash Flow remained strong at \u20ac6.4 billion, albeit down year-on-year versus a record delivery in 2020, when the business was focused on delivering cash in a period of huge uncertainty. For 2021, we declared a 3% increase to the fullyear dividend, taking the dividend for the year to \u20ac4.5 billion.\n\nOverall, we made good progress in 2021. Unilever's growth momentum is building. We stepped up pricing significantly in a heavily inflationary environment while delivering strong earnings and maintaining our restored competitiveness.\n\n## \"We made good progress in 2021 and our growth momentum is building.\"\n\nAlan Jope Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Our five strategic choices\n\nOne of the most encouraging aspects of our growth in 2021 was the extent to which it followed the five Compass strategic choices we called out a year ago. These choices sit at the heart of our strategy for value creation - see pages 8 to 9.\n\nThe first of these is winning with brands and innovation, ensuring that our top brands deliver superior performance. Today, we have 13 brands with sales in excess of \u20ac1 billion. Together they make up over half of our total turnover. Last year, they grew in aggregate by 6.4%. This included some particularly strong individual performances. Dove, for example, grew by 8%, its best performance in eight years; Hellmann's grew 11%; and our Ice Cream brands Magnum and Ben & Jerry's each grew 7%.\n\nBehind the success of these brands is product superiority and great innovation and we continue to step up our performance in both areas. Product superiority in tests versus Unilever's competition is now over 70% of tested turnover, up from less than 50% in 2019, and our focus on driving bigger, better and more impactful innovation delivered over \u20ac1 billion of incremental turnover in 2021, double the delivery in 2020.\n\nIt is no surprise or coincidence that our top-performing brands also happen to be those with the most clearly defined - and powerfully articulated - commitment to purpose as a driver of brand growth.\n\nAs well as focusing on winning with our biggest and strongest brands, we have also chosen to prioritise investment in the key growth markets for the future, including most notably the US, India and China.\n\nAll three countries delivered strong and competitive growth in 2021. The US, for example, grew almost 4% on top of a record growth year in 2020, while India and China grew well into double-digits, albeit against weaker comparators.\n\nOther markets also performed well, but not all. Indonesia, for example, a key geography for Unilever, struggled last year and was down by 7.4%. We are fully focused on restoring growth in this, our sixth-largest market.\n\nOur next strategic choice is to invest in the capabilities needed to lead in channels of the future. Today, that means winning in eCommerce, and in 2021 we delivered another strong year, on the back of record growth in 2020. In total, the eCommerce business was up 44% with growth coming from all the main sub-channels - pure-play, omnichannel, and business-tobusiness (eB2B). In just five years, this channel has gone from 2% of our turnover to 13% in 2021.\n\nDeveloping Unilever's portfolio into the higher growth spaces of Hygiene, Skin care, Prestige beauty, Functional nutrition and Plant-based foods is another strategic choice. It is also one that made a meaningful contribution to performance in 2021. While organic growth is our first priority, acquisitions also play an important role. Indeed, since 2017, 93% of M&A capital has gone into either Prestige beauty, Functional nutrition or Skin care and other areas of Beauty & Personal Care. By contrast, 98% of disposals by turnover were in slower growth food segments such as Spreads and more recently Tea.\n\nThe benefits of this portfolio rotation were very apparent last year - which including eketerra will be equivalent to 17% of our",

        "page_content": "2021 turnover since 2017. Prestige beauty, for example, now a \u20ac1 billion business, grew over 20%. Functional nutrition, which includes Horlicks in South Asia as well as our largely US-based Vitamins, Supplements & Minerals (VMS) business, grew 22% in 2021 and now enjoys leadership positions across its portfolio.\n\nTogether, Functional nutrition and Prestige beauty contributed 60bps to our underlying sales growth last year.\n\nWe will go on building Unilever's portfolio in this way, while recognising that not all acquisitions have performed equally well. Dollar Shave Club, for example, has not delivered in the way that we had hoped or expected, mainly due to changes in the economics of the direct-to-consumer model.\n\nIn considering the evolution of our portfolio, Consumer Health and Wellbeing undoubtedly represents an attractive space. It is also one in which we are increasingly well positioned. Last year, after a long period of careful review, the Board concluded that moving Unilever's portfolio even more decisively into this area would position the company for faster growth in the coming decades. This is what lay behind confidential discussions with GSK and Pfizer about the possible acquisition of GSK Consumer Health. We listened carefully to shareholders in the wake of those discussions becoming public and heard the message that many did not support a deal on this scale at this time. We remain resolved in the direction of our portfolio evolution, but we have made clear that we do not intend to pursue similar large-scale acquisitions in the foreseeable future.\n\nInstead, we will continue to accelerate Unilever's growth through a rigorous focus on organic growth and by continuing to strengthen the portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and selective disposals. Guided by our five Compass strategic choices, we are fully committed to stepping up the growth of our existing business.\n\nWe will be aided significantly in this process by our fifth strategic choice - building a purpose-led, future-fit organisation and growth culture.\n\nHaving operated for some time under a relatively heavy matrix structure, with three global Divisions and 15 regional performance management units, we are now modernising Unilever's organisation with the introduction - from 1 July 2022 - of five Business Groups with full, end-to-end responsibility for setting strategy and for delivering results.\n\nThe five Business Groups - Beauty and Wellbeing; Personal Care; Home Care; Nutrition; and Ice Cream - will have the power to drive performance by responding more quickly and directly to the consumer and channel dynamics that are unique to their Business Group. This is a big change for Unilever, one that we are confident will result in a simpler, faster and more agile way of operating, with more focused and expert categories and with greater empowerment and accountability flowing through the business.\n\nWe are alive to the risks of a change management programme on this scale and have put in place a number of mitigating measures, including the creation of a well-resourced Transformation Office to oversee the detailed delivery of the programme in line with ambitious but achievable timescales.\n\n## Outlook - 4G Growth\n\nOur overarching goal remains the delivery of 4G growth that is, growth which is consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible. All four are key to our long-term value creation model. On profitable growth, in 2021 we fell short\n\nof delivering an improvement in underlying operating margin, having chosen - in the face of spiralling inflation - to continue investing in advertising, R&D and other long-term drivers of growth.\n\nWe will continue to take this approach in 2022, when we expect input cost inflation to ratchet up still further. This means that we expect our underlying operating margin will be down in 2022, although we anticipate that the effect of pricing action and well-established savings programmes to help reverse this decline over the course of 2023 and 2024.\n\nImportantly, we have entered 2022 with good growth momentum and with our biggest brands, our most important markets, and our priority channel all performing strongly. The five strategic choices that we have put in place will guide us in the years ahead, and are having a positive and demonstrable impact on performance. The introduction of a new operating model during the year will help accelerate our progress still further.\n\n## Stakeholders\n\nTogether with our world-leading brands, our biggest strength remains the dedication and professionalism of our employees around the world, plus the millions more who make up Unilever's extended family across the value chain. To all of them, I offer my sincere appreciation for their hard work and commitment over a year characterised by many challenges but also a lot of progress.\n\nWe remain fully wedded to Unilever's multi-stakeholder model and I want to thank all of those with whom we have partnered over the last year, and all those whose needs and interests we are committed to serving. We deliberately cite the planet as one of our stakeholders and in the year of COP26, it was a source of particular pride to see Unilever - in its words and actions - living up to its ambitious climate commitments.\n\nFinally, I want to thank and acknowledge our shareholders for their continued support of our business. We are working hard to repay that support and are fully focused on delivering longterm value for shareholders in line with our 4G growth model.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As Covid rates spiked and restrictions were imposed and then eased in different countries at different times, we worked to manage disruption to our supply chains, building on our experience from 2020.\n\n## Our performance in 2021\n\nWe delivered underlying sales growth of 4.5% in 2021. Our growth was broad-based, with all three Divisions growing. We achieved this while maintaining our competitiveness with 53% of our business winning share. While our pricing and savings programmes helped to offset some of the impact of mounting input costs, our underlying operating margin was down 10bps at 18.4%. Free cash flow remained healthy at \u20ac6.4 billion, albeit down from record levels last year. For more details on our performance see the Financial review on pages 36 to 43.\n\n## Five strategic choices for growth\n\nIn early 2021, we set out in detail the Unilever Compass strategy to deliver our vision. The five clear, sharpened choices we have made in our Compass strategy - portfolio, brands, markets, channels and culture - along with the continued delivery of our 5 Growth Fundamentals, have been playing an important role in building momentum across the business.\n\n## \"We're focused on driving faster growth from our strong portfolio of brands and markets.\"\n\nAlan Jope Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Developing our portfolio into high growth spaces\n\nOur investments in high growth spaces continued in 2021. As well as our established businesses in hygiene and skin care where we continue to drive science-based innovation (see pages 20 to 24), we're building sizeable new businesses in areas such as Prestige beauty, Functional nutrition and Plant-based foods, which are contributing to our growth. Our Prestige beauty business, now including the digitally-led cruelty-free Paula's Choice brand which we acquired in 2021, delivered strong double-digit growth in 2021 and reached \u20ac1 billion turnover if we include a full year of Paula's Choice. (a)\n\nFunctional nutrition is another area of focus for our portfolio transformation into high growth spaces. It includes Horlicks and our Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements (VMS) brands such as Olly, Liquid I.V., and Onnit, a leading brand in the fast-growing area of nootropics, acquired in 2021. Functional nutrition grew double-digit in 2021 and reached \u20ac1.5 billion turnover if we include a full year of Onnit. (a) We're also expanding our plant-based portfolio to meet growing consumer demand - see page 22.\n\nIn November 2021, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell our global Tea business, now known as ekaterra, to CVC Capital Partners Fund VIII for \u20ac4.5 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis. The transaction excludes Unilever's tea business in India, Nepal and Indonesia as well as the Pepsi Lipton ready-to-drink tea joint ventures and associated distribution businesses. We expect to complete this transaction in the second half of 2022, subject to receiving regulatory approvals and completing works council consultation processes. Once we dispose of eketerra, our portfolio rotation will be equivalent to 17% of our 2021 turnover since 2017. (b)\n\n## Winning with our brands as a force for good, powered by purpose and innovation\n\nWe hold clear global leadership positions in seven categories; and in a further two, we lead in terms of volume sold but not yet value. We've stepped up our investments in science and technology to strengthen the quality and efficacy of our products - 95% of the turnover we've tested was equal or better than the main competitor product, with 71% winning outright. (c) Insights from testing help us improve product performance through innovation. Focusing our R&D activities on fewer and bigger projects is also bringing innovations to market faster. In total, our innovation programme helped to deliver \u20ac1 billion in incremental turnover in 2021 - double that of 2020. See pages 20 to 24 for more on our brands and innovation.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholders continued\n\nOur focus on winning with brands and innovation saw our 13 \u20ac1 billion brands - also among our most purposeful - grow in aggregate by over 6% in 2021. These brands now make up half of our total turnover. See pages 20 to 24 for more on brands with purpose and how we're building our marketing capability.\n\n## Accelerating in USA, India, China and key growth markets\n\nAround 36% of our turnover is from three markets: the US, India and China. Having a strong brand and category presence here is key to our future growth, as these countries are predicted to account for well over half of global economic growth by 2030. To strengthen and expand our business in these priority markets, we're growing our core brands, transforming our portfolio to capitalise on high growth opportunities and growing our digital and eCommerce channel presence.\n\n## US\n\nThe US is our largest market and we grew 3.7% in 2021 against a very strong prior year comparator. Delivering breakthrough technology innovations through our purposeful brands such as Dove, and scaling our recently acquired brands such as Olly and SheaMoisture, has helped to drive the growth of our US business. Data-driven customer partnerships are also unlocking further opportunities, such as exclusive bath range launches with two US retailers.\n\nOur US business continues to benefit from our portfolio transformation into higher growth areas such as Functional nutrition and Prestige beauty - building on the strength of brands such as Liquid I.V. and Living Proof. The growth of eCommerce in the US continued in 2021 - enabled by an increased focus on innovations designed for channel and strengthened digital capabilities.\n\n## India\n\nOur Hindustan Unilever (HUL) business is India's largest FMCG company. We delivered a strong all-round performance, growing at 13.4%.\n\nWe're growing our core brands by focusing on superior products and purpose. Surf excel, for instance, continued to build relevance through our iconic 'Dirt is Good' campaign and delivered strong performance. And Lifebuoy strengthened our market leadership as the number one soap brand in India, building on its hygiene credentials (see page 31). HUL has a strong track record of building scale in new categories through market development, by moving consumers to new products with added benefits - such as liquid detergents, functional tea with wellness benefits and body wash.\n\nBrands such as Surf excel, Dove and TRESemm\u00e9 are responding to the needs of consumers and leading premiumisation. The newly formed Premium Beauty Business unit within HUL will strengthen our presence in the fast-growing masstige beauty segment. The premium portfolio performed well in 2021.\n\nWe made significant progress on the integration of the Horlicks portfolio. Our focus now is on building category relevance and growing penetration - through innovations in the high science range, such as Diabetes Plus, as well as a step up in marketing and communications, home visits to promote products and the introduction of affordable packs.\n\nOur eCommerce sales in India saw double-digit growth in 2021. We're also reaching more small retail stores through digital channels - our eB2B app Shikhar is now used by over 700,000 retailers. Through direct-to-consumer platforms, we're expanding our digital footprint further. The iconic beauty brand Lakme, for instance, is the most followed Indian beauty brand on Instagram with around 30% of its sales in 2021 through digital channels.\n\n## China\n\nChina has grown into our third-largest market by fulfilling diverse and constantly changing consumer needs - doubling in size over the last decade. We grew by 14.3% in 2021.\n\nOur success in China is built on our core brands - including Knorr, OMO, Dove and CLEAR - which are combining product superiority and brand purpose to expand penetration and sales. Transforming the portfolio is also key to unlocking future growth opportunities, such as in personal and home hygiene and masstige, and by premiumising brands such as Vaseline which has evolved from a basic body care range to cover whole body expert skin healing. We're also expanding our Prestige beauty and VMS offerings with a selective roll-out of brands such as SmartyPants.\n\nSales through eCommerce in China grew double-digit in 2021. Further eCommerce growth is expected as penetration increases in lower-tier cities. Partnerships with eCommerce platforms such as JD.com and Alibaba (see page 25) and expanding reach to newer channels such as live streaming and social commerce, will continue this upward trend.\n\n## Leading in the channels of the future\n\nWe're increasingly designing products and organising our business for eCommerce by working with partners such as Amazon and Alibaba as well as large retailers who are expanding their footprint across a range of digital commerce channels. Our eCommerce sales grew by 44% in 2021 and accounted for 13% of our total turnover - we see no sign of this shift reversing (see page 37 for a definition of eCommerce sales). We sell around 50% of our Prestige beauty products, for example, through eCommerce channels, including direct to consumer. See page 25 for more.\n\nWith our innovation and merchandising strategies firmly rooted in shopper insights, we'll continue to adapt at speed to trends, such as consumers wanting quick and delicious food delivered to their door. Our Ice Cream Now platform for instant ice cream delivery, for example, grew by 60% in 2021. We're also increasingly using digital sales platforms with our customers, both large and small. See page 26 for more on our eB2B growth.",

This also helps us attract the very best people, as evidenced by our status as number one FMCG employer of choice for graduates and early career talent in over 50 markets.\n\nMore agile application of technology alongside simpler ways of working will help us stay one step ahead of consumer trends.

We're also reskilling and upskilling our people, and embracing hybrid ways of work to prepare for the future of work - see pages 18 to 19.\n\nIn January 2022 we announced changes to our organisational model to make us a simpler, more category-focused business see pages 6 to 7 for more.\n\n- (a) Prestige beauty and Functional nutrition turnover for 2021 calculated as if Paula's Choice and Onnit respectively, had been acquired on 1 January 2021.\n- (b) Portfolio rotation is the 2021 turnover from any acquisitions completed since 2017 (including a full year of turnover for 2021 acquisitions) plus the last twelve months' of turnover from our disposals since 2017 (including eketerra) as a percentage of our 2021 turnover.\n- (c) Based on tests of our top products in 60 countries over the past three years to benchmark product superiority (turnover weighted).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Around 90,000 people took part in our UniVoice employee survey this year. We sustained very high engagement levels - 82% in offices and 83% in factories - which places us in the top quartile for employee engagement compared to industry benchmarks.\n\n## Protecting health, safety and wellbeing\n\nAlongside safety at work, supporting our people's physical, mental and emotional wellbeing has never been more important.\n\n## Supporting our people through the pandemic\n\nWe've continued to help our people protect themselves from the virus by working to remove barriers to testing and encouraging vaccinations to keep our workplaces as safe and productive as possible. We ensured that thousands of our employees received medical care through our own facilities and healthcare resources, telehealth options or connections to community resources, and supported the colleagues and families of those we sadly lost to Covid.\n\nWe continued promoting healthy living and working for all our employees. To help people get the medical support they need, for example we now offer triage services in India and the UK. We launched a new digital tool in four countries that helps people identify their risk of type 2 diabetes, followed by a 12-month programme to reduce those risks. Participants in our Brazil and Mexico pilots have reported improvements to their quality of life and sleep, as well as less stress and time off work due to ill health.\n\nWe also intensified our focus on mental health, introducing online training in ten languages to help our people understand the impact of Covid on their mental health. More people used our Employee Assistance Programme this year, and our global network of mental health champions more than doubled to around 4,000 people. Our teams are using a new tool to assess their energy levels and better support each other. Due to these and other initiatives, the percentage of our people who feel Unilever cares about their wellbeing is rising: 85% in offices (81% in 2020) and 83% in factories (70% in 2019).\n\n## Safety at work\n\nWe continue to prioritise the safety of our people and contractors in everyday work situations - from using mechanical equipment to staying safe on the roads. Our 2021 UniVoice survey showed that over 90% of employees feel that Unilever is committed to their safety. We rolled out a new incident management tool which connects our sites around\n\nthe world on a single digital platform. We also increased resources to ensure appropriate oversight for safety.\n\nOur Total Recordable Frequency Rate (TRFR) improved from 0.63 to 0.55 accidents per million hours worked (1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021), partly related to fewer accidents at Unilever offices due to continued working from home. Sadly however, fatalities continued to rise. In the reporting period, three contractors and four employees lost their lives. Two contractors were fatally electrocuted at one of our sites in Pakistan in one event; and a contractor in Hungary lost their life in a construction incident. Two employees were struck by lightning in separate incidents in Kenya and Tanzania. And two employees were involved in a fatal car accident in India.\n\nWhen fatalities occur, our first priority is to support the emotional and physical needs of the families and team members of the individuals involved. We work with local law enforcement, communities and regulators to fully investigate the root cause and determine further preventative measures.\n\nSee our website for more on safety at work\n\n## New ways of working\n\nThe world of work is changing. Our 2021 employee survey showed that around three-quarters of our people believe we have become simpler, faster and more agile in the last 12 months. Covid-19 has been a catalyst to expand flexible and more inclusive ways of working.\n\nWe're rethinking how we work as an employer. The fact that the satisfaction and connection levels of new employees have risen since our last pre-Covid survey is testament to the effectiveness of our evolved ways of working. So we've moved to a hybrid model for our office-based employees. This means thinking about work as what people do, not where they do it - with our offices as collaboration spaces and people able to work where they'll be most effective. Our global guiding principles for hybrid working state that we expect our employees to spend at least 40% of their time in the office.\n\nWe're also pioneering new ways of working which both unlock capacity and help individuals find a meaningful and balanced way of working. Our AI-powered internal talent marketplace, Flex, allows us to match the skills needed for projects to people, regardless of where they sit in the organisation. It helped us reprioritise more than 110,000 hours to around 1,350 critical projects in 2021. In addition we have flexible working options like job-sharing or paid learning sabbaticals. Our people now have the option to work as a contractor on a project-by-project basis through the 'U-Work' programme in seven countries. This gives them the flexibility associated with contract roles and they are paid a monthly retainer fee with a core set of benefits.",

        "page_content": "## Skills for the future\n\nWe're creating a culture of learning across Unilever, upskilling and reskilling our people for jobs of the future. Our employees accessed the Degreed learning platform over 4.2 million times during 2021. In our latest employee survey, 83% of our people in offices and 77% of our people in factories said they believe Unilever gives them a chance to upgrade their skills for a successful future.\n\nIn 2021, we focused on building critical digital commerce skills throughout our business, including an eCommerce accelerator hub and bootcamp for our customer development teams and enhancing digital access in our factories to ensure our people have future-fit capabilities. Our Future of Work in Manufacturing programme gave frontline workers access to technology that enables shared learning on the job and better processes and communications. This is an important step towards our factories becoming the efficient digital workplaces we'll need for our future growth.\n\nOur ultimate goal is for no one to be left behind as the world of work continues to change. In December 2021, we held our first Future of Work conference to share our progress and learnings and build alliances with forward-thinking companies. We're also aiming to help equip 10 million young people with essential skills for jobs by 2030 - see page 30 for more.\n\nSee our website for more on the future of work\n\n## Nurturing our growth culture\n\nWe see a human, purposeful and accountable culture that is rooted in our values as essential to our purpose-led and future-fit organisation. Using our future-fit plans, our people are shaping development and career plans based on their purpose - we've made a good start by upskilling or reskilling 7% of our people in 2021. We now have statistical evidence from ongoing research led by the London School of Economics of the link between purpose and intrinsic motivation, based on data from 3,500 employees across 14 countries.\n\n## Equity, diversity and inclusion\n\nWe also want to be a workplace in which everyone feels they belong and are able to thrive. This means creating an inclusive culture free from the barriers that limit people in reaching their true potential. We've identified four equity, diversity and inclusion priorities - gender, race and ethnicity, people with disabilities and LGBTQI+ communities. This is where we will put our global focus to address under-representation and overcome possible challenges in career progression and to foster a greater sense of inclusion. We're building the capabilities of our business leaders and HR practitioners to support equity advocacy, diversity awareness and psychological safety in their teams.\n\nWe're working to build a better understanding of the diversity of our workforce in order to identify specific community needs. For example, we've conducted a cultural assessment and focus groups with over 2,000 employees in Brazil, India and the UK to explore attitudes and barriers around disability inclusion in Unilever. Our LGBTQI+ employee network has increased to over 1,000 members, and we're continuing to expand it\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNo1\n\nFMCG employer of choice for graduates and early career talent in over 50 markets\n\nto increase advocacy for human rights and safe havens for this community.\n\nOur race and ethnicity strategy is focused on four markets (Brazil, South Africa, the UK and US). These are leading our work to make our recruitment practices more equitable by increasing the representation of black and brown people, building more inclusive and equitable cultures, and expanding local partnerships and advocacy.\n\nOur gender balance at management level changed slightly in 2021, with women now accounting for 52% of all management employees. Our work continues to increase the representation of women, particularly at senior levels. This year, we reintroduced a tool that uses a mix of behavioural science and data to raise awareness of senior leaders' hiring patterns and unconscious bias in decision-making. See page 64 for our gender balance statistics.\n\nSee our website for more on equity, diversity and inclusion\n\n## Working with integrity\n\nOur focus is on growth in line with our values, not on growth at any cost. We review our Code of Business Principles and Code Policies every year to ensure they reflect the current operating context and the latest legal requirements. In 2021, we further strengthened our Code Policies on data security and fraud. Our zero-tolerance approach to bribery continues to be supported through mandatory training and initiatives delivered to all employees.\n\nWe train our people every year to prevent compliance breaches, and they're able to report in confidence any concerns around business integrity through our 24/7 Speak Up platform. In 2021, we continued to simplify and improve the whistleblowing process for users through expansion of local hotlines and interpreting services.\n\nOn our website, we report the number of Code cases and subsequent actions for each of our five Code themes including countering corruption - covering amongst other things antibribery and avoiding conflicts of interest. This year, across all areas of our Code of Business Principles, we received 1,275 Code reports, closed 1,246 reports (including some from prior years) and confirmed 694 reports as breaches, which led to 369 people leaving the business. Our data on Code breaches provides insights into issues and where they happen so that we can prevent behaviours that lead to them.",

Shoppers also continue to be increasingly discerning - looking for highly effective products, with ingredients that are good for them and good for the environment. There is now compelling evidence that brands with purpose grow. Our own research shows a strong correlation between brand purpose and brand attractiveness referred to as brand power - which in turn drives market share and growth. Other independent research from Kantar shows that the category of most sustainable shoppers who are highly concerned about the environment, is now around 1 in 5 of the global adult population - with the potential to reach 1 in 3 by 2024.\n\nEven as some countries relaxed restrictions and people started to spend more time out of the home, online shopping and the demand for convenience stayed strong - e-everything is here to stay. Many people chose to stay home even when they had other options - continuing to cook at home instead of eating out, for example. The varying impact of the pandemic has also led to some shoppers treating themselves to more premium products while others are increasingly cost-conscious, looking for the best-performing products they can afford. Despite the price increases brought about by commodity inflation, we continued to offer value for everyone.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus\n\n## Saying no to normal\n\nAs part of our commitment to challenging narrow beauty ideals, we're eliminating the use of the word 'normal' across all our Beauty & Personal Care products and communications, globally. We'll end any digital alteration to change a person's body shape, size, proportion or skin colour across all advertising material, and increase the number of advertisements portraying people from diverse groups. Our brands are already putting this commitment into action. Dove's Reverse Selfie campaign launched in 2021 to highlight the effect retouching apps have on girls' self-esteem. And Sunsilk released a music video in Turkey featuring inspiring women who are breaking the mould.\n\nTo capitalise on these consumer trends, we're building our marketing capability to support the growth of our brands. We're particularly focused on digital marketing which now makes up to 40% of our media spend. And we're harnessing new AI-powered innovation tools to spot trends early and test new product concepts. Against this dynamic backdrop, our three Divisions worked to anticipate and meet consumers' needs with their products and purpose-led brands.\n\n## Beauty & Personal Care\n\n## We want to be the most positive beauty business in the world for people and the planet.\n\nWe believe in beauty that not only does less harm, but also does more good - beauty that's both inclusive and sustainable. To achieve our new Positive Beauty vision, we're using our scale to create positive change and drive growth through our big brands, impactful innovation and portfolio transformation.\n\n## Growing our core brands\n\nDove grew strongly this year reaching \u20ac5 billion turnover, supported by renovation of its core products, such as Dove Care & Protect which is now available in 50 countries with clinically proven, superior moisturisation. Dove also launched the premium Hair Therapy range, combining expert hair care solutions with skin care-inspired ingredients.\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the importance of hygiene, and our brands continued to meet this need, despite the slowdown in the sale of hand sanitisers which affected the growth of Lifebuoy and Suave. Lifebuoy's handwashing campaigns continued to raise awareness and contributed to a large increase in brand power - a measure of brand attractiveness - and its ranking as the third most chosen FMCG brand in the world by Kantar. Lux relaunched its core soap bars and body washes with superior benefits, such as long-lasting fragrance.\n\nRexona relaunched its core deodorant range with 72-hour non-stop protection against sweat and body odour. And our male grooming brand Axe refreshed its identity to celebrate and represent all types of attraction, in addition to a major reformulation that fights odour instead of masking it.\n\n## Impactful innovation\n\nWe're anticipating future consumer needs by focusing our innovations on fewer projects with bigger impact. This year, we've scaled our industry-leading pro-lipid technology which helps to nourish skin from within. Developed by our dermatology scientists, it's now available across our biggest skin care brands such as Dove, Vaseline, and Pond's.",

For example, our reformulated Dove Body Wash uses a gentle formulation to support a healthy skin microbiome.\n\nWe're also dialling up our innovation partnerships to anticipate future consumer needs. The digital Uni-Excubator we launched in 2020 in China has been giving start-ups unique access to our insights and expertise in areas such as technology, sustainability and distribution networks. In return we've harnessed their skills and agility to help our brands grow. We're partnering with Alibaba's Tmall platform which is hosting the Uni-Excubator's flagship store, Uni-Topia Planet, showcasing exclusive new beauty and personal care products and driving sales through its channel.\n\n## Portfolio transformation\n\nWe're building a sizeable Prestige beauty business, a key part of our strategy to evolve our portfolio into high growth spaces. Prestige is growing fast, with turnover of \u20ac1 billion in 2021 if we include a full year of Paula's Choice, a digitally led, crueltyfree skin care brand. The growth of Prestige was supported by new innovations from Dermalogica, REN - and Hourglass with a breakthrough red lipstick that offers consumers a vegan alternative to the red pigment traditionally made from crushed beetles.\n\nSkin care grew single-digit in 2021. Potential in the category is high, but there is more we need to do to fully capitalise on the opportunity. By targeting our top markets with breakthrough innovations such as pro-lipids, as well as locally relevant brand purpose activities, we're already seeing strong growth of brands such as Vaseline which performed strongly in 2021, supported by a number of premium innovations across skin brightening, therapeutics and hydration. Good growth also came from brands such as Pond's which continues to offer more premium ranges.\n\nWe continued to expand our presence across eCommerce channels - eCommerce sales accounted for 16% of our Beauty & Personal Care turnover in 2021. We're also looking at digital commerce and capitalising on this growth in a number of\n\n\"Positive Beauty isn't just about doing the right thing for the planet, it's also helping to grow our business too.\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDove grew high single-digit in 2021 and reached another turnover milestone\n\n## \u20ac5bn\n\nways. For example, through our new Positive Beauty Growth Platform which aims to partner with start-ups and scale-ups from around the world on cutting-edge projects. Our initial invitation for pitches focused on the emerging channel of social commerce - from livestream shopping to gaming. We're now working with the shortlisted applicants to partner with our brands.\n\n## People positive\n\nWe know that consumers want health and beauty products which they feel represent them. So we're focused on growing our global portfolio of brands that are inclusive and care for all skin, hair and body types, championing the diversity of beauty.\n\nAs well as saying 'no to normal', our Beauty & Personal Care brands are using their power to serve more diverse communities and break down stereotypes and prejudice. As hair can be a source of discrimination for people from different races and ethnicities, we're working to help people make the most of all hair types. By pinpointing the proteins that differ in curly and straight hair, we were able to launch one of the first product ranges - Nexxus Curl Define in the US - which caters to each hair type's specific needs.\n\nIn line with its purpose to give people the confidence to move more, Degree piloted the world's first prototype deodorant designed to be easier for people with disabilities to use. Alongside this, to get audiences thinking differently about sportspeople, the brand also released short films featuring diverse athletes defying stereotypes.\n\nSee page 30 for more on how Beauty & Personal Care brands worked to improve health and wellbeing and advance equity and inclusion in 2021.\n\n## Planet positive\n\nWe're committed to doing less harm and more good for the natural world by protecting and regenerating 1.5 million hectares of land, forests and oceans by 2030. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the effect of the products they buy on the environment - and especially plastic pollution. Towards our goal to use less, better and no plastic, our oral care ranges, starting with France in 2021, began rolling out recyclable toothpaste tubes. And Dove launched 'buy once, refill for life' aluminium deodorant sticks. For more on plastic, see page 29.",

Requests for new animal tests in Europe threaten the European Union's ban on animal testing for cosmetics. Dove and our other 27 PETA-approved brands united with The Body Shop and animal protection organisations to campaign to save cruelty-free cosmetics. Regulatory changes in China have allowed for the import of more cosmetic products without the requirement for animal testing, meaning more consumers will be able to enjoy our beauty products.\n\n## Foods & Refreshment\n\n## We're on a mission to be a world-class force for good in food.\n\nOur brands continue to provide great-tasting, nutritious and sustainable foods for consumers all over the world - using our world-class innovation and brand purpose to inspire change.\n\n## Irresistible innovation\n\nDuring 2021 we continued to grow our core brands. Knorr, our biggest Foods & Refreshment brand grew high singledigit, supported by bigger innovations and a clear purpose. It launched its first zero salt bouillon in Europe - now available in ten markets, offering cooks unique blends of vegetables, herbs and spices, while supporting our goal to reduce salt intake. Its purpose to 'reinvent food for humanity', inspired the inaugural Eat for Good day, which aims to empower 'Eativists' who want to make a difference to the world through their food choices, as well as building brand awareness. And the 'futureproof your recipe' platform on Recipedia, where consumers can share Future 50 Foods recipe ideas, is expanding to other countries after a successful launch in Mexico.\n\nHellmann's, the world's number one mayonnaise, grew double-digit for the second year in succession. Continuing its mission to inspire 100 million people to waste less food, its 2021 Superbowl campaign led to increased brand awareness and a boost in sales. And Hellmann's vegan mayonnaise, now available in 33 markets, launched three new flavours Baconnaise, Chipotle and Garlic.\n\nWhile varying levels of restrictions around the world affected our sales of out-of-home ice cream in 2021, our ice cream brands grew mid-single digit - as Ben & Jerry's (now a \u20ac1 billion brand), Wall's and Magnum continued to offer muchloved favourites and new flavours, such as Magnum's Double Gold Caramel Billionaire - available in 35 markets. Not only an indulgent ice cream, it comes in 100% recycled plastic tubs developed with advanced recycling technology which is now being rolled out to other brands.\n\n## Expanding our plant-based portfolio\n\nWe continued to step up our plant-based offerings through a number of our brands. Our plant-based meat and dairy replacement business saw strong double-digit growth in 2021 in pursuit of \u20ac1 billion annual sales by 2025-2027. This was primarily driven by The Vegetarian Butcher, which is growing\n\nin all 55 markets, both in foodservice and retail. The latest addition to its meat alternatives is the Patty on the Back burger, a breakthrough plant-based burger. Not only is the burger lower in calories and fat than meat, it's higher in fibre and iron and has similar salt levels.\n\nOur plant-based ice cream range continued to grow with brands like Ben & Jerry's, Magnum, Breyers, Cornetto, Carte D'Or and Swedish Glace offering non-dairy options. With Magnum's Vegan Sea Salt Caramel winning a PETA Vegan Food Award in 2021, all the brand's vegan flavours are now awardwinning. Certified vegan non-dairy now makes up over 25% of Ben & Jerry's pint flavours in the US.\n\nWe're also using cutting-edge food science to find alternative proteins and new ways to cook without meat. In Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, we launched Rinde M\u00e1s, a blend of herbs, spices, vegetables and protein that gives cooks an affordable way to reduce the meat in their dishes. We've also begun working with food-tech company ENOUGH to develop new plant-based products based on mycoprotein - from a process that uses 93% less water, 97% less feed and 97% less carbon than meat.\n\nWe were again named by investor network FAIRR as a pioneer in sustainable protein research and innovation and ranked number one in its protein transition index for 2021.\n\nSee our website for more on plant-based foods\n\n## Growing our channel footprint\n\nWe're finding new ways to make our brands available to consumers, wherever they are. Sales through eCommerce continue to grow, and accounted for 9% of our Foods & Refreshment turnover in 2021. Our Ice Cream Now business caters to the rise of 'in-home' eating, by quickly delivering our brands to consumers in 35 countries, growing 60% in 2021. And our out-of-home professional foodservices business, Unilever Food Solutions (UFS), grew double-digit in 2021 despite the ongoing impact of restrictions. UFS is now working with cloud kitchens - commercial kitchens that prepare and cook food purely for delivery - such as Casper, a cloud kitchen pioneer in Belgium, where we provide a range of products from our Vegetarian Butcher portfolio, as well as specific ingredients and flavours.\n\n\"We're improving the health of the planet by changing what's on our plates.\"\n\nHanneke Faber President, Foods & Refreshment",

Knorr continues its work with farmers and growers through a new series of 50 projects. Part of our Climate & Nature Fund, it aims to establish regenerative agriculture sourcing for 80% of its key raw materials over five years. One project, for example, is using satellite data and digital sensors to help tomato farmers in the south of Spain optimise their water use and improve soil health through cover cropping. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where the cocoa used by Magnum is grown by Rainforest Alliance farmers, the brand has planted 465,000 native trees and is working with farmers to tackle deforestation. For more on nature see pages 30 and 52.\n\nWe're meeting consumer demand for more sustainable packaging by using less, better or no plastic. Many of our foods brands already use 100% recycled plastic, such as Hellmann's and Bango. And we're now making progress in finding better ways to overcome technical challenges with sachets that are hard to recycle, for example by bringing out groundbreaking paper-based recyclable pouches for our Colman's range in the UK. For more on plastic see page 29.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus\n\n## Knorr: building a greener food future\n\nOur largest food brand continues to take bold and innovative steps towards healthier eating and a healthier planet. Through its new zero salt bouillon, its promotion of Future 50 Foods - a collection of nutritious and sustainable plant-based foods - and its new World Eat for Good day, the brand is encouraging people to swap out traditional ingredients for healthier ones. And now, through its new Grown for Good initiative, Knorr will create 50 regenerative agriculture projects to transform how its key ingredients are grown. The first three projects are looking at water preservation and soil health with key suppliers of tomatoes, rice and vegetables. Knorr grew high single-digit in 2021.\n\n## Home Care\n\n## We're making people's homes a better world, and our world a better home.\n\nAs we work to make the lives of the people who buy our products easier, cleaner and safer, we're also leading our industry towards a cleaner future through the power of science and innovation. Our relentless focus on meeting consumer needs with superior products has fuelled the steady and competitive growth of many of our brands.\n\n## Powering growth through Clean Future\n\nWe know people want to clean their homes and clothes without damaging the planet. We're making good progress in transforming some of the world's most well-known household brands to disinfect, clean, freshen up and remove stains better than ever while lowering their carbon emissions and waste, in line with our 'Clean Future' strategy.\n\nOur biggest Home Care brand, Dirt is Good (also known as OMO, Surf Excel, Persil or Skip) is key to our Clean Future ambitions - and leads the transformation of our entire Home Care business. It launched a successful new liquid range that uses plant-based stain removers without compromising on performance. It's suitable for low-temperature washing, with a lower GHG impact than laundry powders, and is packaged in mostly recycled plastic bottles.\n\nTo help reduce its use of plastic packaging, Dirt is Good also rolled out a six times concentrated OMO dilute-at-home laundry liquid in our biggest laundry market, Latin America. It quickly became a top-seller in Argentina and Brazil. Not only does this make the brand affordable to more consumers, it also uses around 70% less plastic than a conventional 3-litre bottle, and is now more biodegradable. Dirt is Good grew mid single-digit in 2021 and increased its global brand power score, also winning WARC and Effie awards for the effective communication of its brand purpose to consumers. For more on our Clean Future innovations, see pages 31 and 52.\n\nSunlight, one of our \u20ac1 billion brands, started to roll out a new plant-based formulation for its hand dishwash products across the world. With biodegradable active ingredients, it's also proven to deliver a superior cleaning experience.\n\nIn 2021, we entered a multi-year partnership with Arzeda to design new enzymes for our laundry and cleaning products, including OMO, Surf and Sunlight. Applying the latest advances in digital biology, the new enzymes have the potential to significantly reduce the number of ingredients we use, while delivering superior products, new cleaning benefits and a lower environmental footprint.\n\nSee our website for more on our Clean Future strategy",

Lifebuoy home disinfectants, delivering 24 hours of disinfection with 100% natural cleaning ingredients, are now available in the UK, Germany, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. And in Indonesia we rolled out a new antibacterial Sunlight washing-up liquid that can be used without water and rinsing.\n\nOur air purification brand Blueair enjoyed a particularly strong year in 2021. Its latest innovation, HealthProtect, which provides protection against viruses and bacteria, supported a record year of growth for Blueair. The brand also made great strides in its Freedom to Breathe campaign which supports children's right to clean air, after the Committee of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child acknowledged children's right to clean air.\n\n## Value through more convenient formats and channels\n\nOur Home Care brands have a long track record of helping consumers access more convenient formats which offer superior benefits and create more value in the market. Our market development activities have accelerated liquid detergent growth to double-digit in most of our key developing and emerging markets. And we're moving consumers from laundry liquids to laundry capsules, so that they get the right dose of detergent every time. Our capsules business enjoyed strong growth, gaining share in most markets. And our OMO capsules became the second most popular laundry capsules in China, ranking first in offline channels.\n\nAs more people turned to online shopping to conveniently buy their cleaning and laundry products during the pandemic, we've renewed our focus on growing our home care digital commerce business. We've also invested in a digital capability team, including a dedicated unit in the UK to create and launch 'design for eCommerce' innovations. Sales through eCommerce accounted for 16% of our Home Care turnover in 2021.\n\nWe continue to focus on taking unproductive costs out of our business. Our 5S programme delivered \u20ac190 million of savings, helping us to invest in future shopping channels, product formats, media, consumer needs and sustainable innovation.\n\n\"We're radically transforming some of the most popular cleaning and laundry brands in the world to deliver great cleaning experiences with lower environmental impact.\"\n\nPeter ter Kulve President, Home Care",

Our customer partners range from large traditional stores to online-only retailers, and from small family-owned shops to value retailers. As our gateway to the people who buy and use our products, these customer partners are critical to our success.\n\n## A shifting retail landscape\n\nOur customers had to adapt throughout the year to changes in people's buying habits as Covid-related restrictions came and went and shopping patterns shifted in different ways at different times around the world. One consistency was the ongoing growth of online retail - with consumers shopping more and more online and new groups of shoppers, such as older age groups, joining them. During the year, global supply chain and logistics challenges made it harder for retailers to predict product availability. So we focused on offering more proactive planning and strategic support and establishing new ways to help our partners of all sizes grow.\n\n## Partnering for growth\n\nWe survey our customers using the Advantage Group Survey to understand our strengths and where we need to improve. This year across the 34 markets we surveyed, we continued to improve customer satisfaction. We were told that customers value the quality of our consumer insights and that we're improving in our service and supply. We were also rated leaders in sustainability. Based on these findings, we continue to improve our capabilities for closer collaboration, smoother processes, more powerful insights and solid business planning and execution. For instance, we're transforming our core business processes across functions by using technology and data to create a superior customer experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital acceleration\n\nDespite the recent surge in digital commerce, only around a third of the world's population shop online - which represents a huge opportunity for growth. We're seeing the rise of new models like social commerce, where people shop through social media platforms, and quick commerce, where people expect to receive their orders in less than an hour. And we're seeing continued growth through some of our biggest eCommerce partners, Amazon and Alibaba.\n\nOur eCommerce sales grew by 44% in 2021 and now represent 13% of our turnover. We're investing significantly in our ability to fulfil online customer orders and our own technology, skills and capabilities in digital commerce. Our aim is to be the digital commerce partner of choice, helping our customers grow in the channels of the future. The power of our brands and marketing, our inclusive content and design, the strength of our supply chain and our focus on sustainability allows us to form unique partnerships.\n\nWe're a launch partner for Amazon as they expand into new markets - most recently Egypt and Poland where our products were available on the day of launch. As one of a select group of manufacturers in Amazon's Tier 1 Global Vendor Program, we work closely together on retail, supply chain, media and sustainability initiatives around the world. Our offering under their Climate Pledge Friendly programme continues to expand, with over 700 items in the programme in 2021. More than half of these are certified as compact by design - lighter products that use less water and packaging, so need less energy to deliver and use. Our Amazon US Climate Pledge Friendly selection online accounted for 7% of our US eCommerce turnover in 2021 - and this will continue to be a key focus for the future.\n\nWe partner with Alibaba across 13 markets. In China, our collaboration goes beyond core commerce into digital transformation across the value chain: from suppliers to marketing to consumer recycling. In March 2021, we launched a joint innovation centre in Hangzhou, China to quickly test, refine and scale product innovations. Our strategic partnership with Alibaba's Lazada platform has helped our products reach consumers across South East Asia since 2017. We also see huge potential in Europe through AliExpress, Alibaba's new local marketplace.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic growth for large retail partners\n\nMost of our large retail partners are evolving from traditional 'bricks and mortar' stores to selling across a blend of channels (omnichannel), with digital commerce playing a significant role. This change in business model requires new ways of thinking about and reaching consumers.\n\nThe shift has led to challenges around product distribution, availability, visibility and promotion for many of our large retail customers. In 2021, we ran pilots of location-based analytics in the US, UK and Netherlands allowing us to track how our products were performing store by store to help customers meet these challenges.\n\nWe also launched a strategic growth initiative for our large retail customers. Through the Partners4Growth programme, we're harnessing insights and foresights from our advanced shopper data analytics to help our customers create growth plans and make sure they have the right products in the right places at the right time. After piloting this approach to mutual growth with Walmart, Carrefour, Target and AholdDelhaize Benelux, we plan to expand to other key customers and ultimately bring all of the elements of our collaboration together in an integrated digital platform.\n\nCloser collaboration and insight-driven initiatives like these with our most valuable customers, alongside a focus on our biggest purpose-led brands, are helping us to further accelerate mutual growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus\n\n## Empowering small retailers through apps\n\nWe're expanding our e-business-to-business (eB2B) platforms to give our small retail customers a safe, non-contact way of interacting with us at convenient times to place orders, track stock and shipments, and see prices and promotions. Not only does this create a better experience for our customers, it helps them increase sales - our digitally enrolled customers grew by 4% more than offline-only stores in 2021. And we can use the data from these apps to predict sales, manage inventory, offer insight-based advice to retailers and improve our customer experience.\n\n## \"In this rapidly changing environment, we are partnering with our customers big and small, digital and physical, to drive shopper loyalty and conversion.\"\n\n## Keith Higgins\n\nChief Customer Development Officer\n\n## Helping small retailers become future-fit\n\nWe believe that by helping smaller retailers engage with the digital economy, we can help them build more resilient and profitable businesses that also grow our sales. In 2021, we expanded our e-business-to-business (eB2B) platforms co-created and owned by Unilever, such as Shikhar in India, Compra Agora in Brazil and GoToko in Indonesia, to help small retailers meet the changing needs of today's shoppers. We've added thousands of new customers each month to reach half of the 4.7 million small stores in the Asia, Latin America and Africa markets we directly serve. They also offer many of our smaller customers access to things like extended payment terms and cashless payments that help them keep their shelves stocked and increase their profits.\n\nWe're working with external researchers to independently assess the impact of three of our initiatives providing smallscale retailers in our value chain with access to finance, technology and training. These include Jaza Duka in Kenya, Siparis Direkt in Turkey and Kabisig Summits in the Philippines. The studies found that 68% of participants reported that their business grew as a result of being in the programmes. As the retail world moves more and more online, we'll continue to invest in digital and financial inclusion for our small retailers everywhere. See page 30 for more on how we're creating economic opportunities throughout our retail value chain.\n\n## Selling with purpose\n\nWith sustainability an important consideration in many consumers' buying decisions, we're working with our customers to deliver on our strategic priorities - such as climate action and health and wellbeing - while engaging consumers on these important issues. One example is our continued partnership with Alibaba to create China's first large-scale closed-loop system of recycling machines. These use artificial intelligence to sort plastic packaging so that it can be fasttracked for reuse - and consumers get 'green points' for their deposits, which they can use to plant trees or protect land.\n\nAnother is the Hygiene 101 sale in the Philippines with Lazada, Shopee and Grab, where popular brands such as Lifebuoy handwash and Domex cleaner were sold with hygiene tips and vouchers to help spread good habits. This was part of a bigger campaign in partnership with the Philippine Public Health Association to create better hygiene behaviours.\n\nWe're also bringing our brands' purposes to life in retail outlets. Through in-store campaigns and materials, we've now reached over 8 million points of sale display units.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Suppliers & business partners\n\n## We're working more closely with our many suppliers and partners around the world to deliver our strategy.\n\nOur supplier ecosystem includes millions of people around the world - from large multinationals to start-ups and small local producers who provide us with goods and services such as raw materials, logistics, advertising, professional services and much more. We also work with a range of business partners, including industry peers, innovation agencies, universities and joint ventures, to help unlock growth and find solutions that benefit our stakeholders.\n\n## Stronger together\n\nCovid-related restrictions continued to challenge supply chains in 2021, with lockdowns affecting our suppliers' businesses in many parts of the world. Commodities, packaging and transport all experienced high levels of inflation. There were shortages of agricultural raw materials, such as tomatoes, soybean oil and rapeseed oil, caused by extreme weather conditions. And globally, supply chains and services were put under pressure due to labour shortages. Meanwhile, consumer demand rebounded in many areas, calling for deeper collaboration, agility and innovation with our network of partners to secure supplies and stay resilient.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we spread production of products across our manufacturing network and held inventory closer to the consumer to ensure availability. We also enhanced our procurement approach: partnering with scoutbee, for example, to bring AI into our supplier discovery process to quicken, streamline and strengthen our search for partners - giving us a more resilient network.\n\n\"Through purpose-led partnerships, we're innovating and finding new opportunities to accelerate growth and scale industry transformation.\"\n\nReginaldo Ecclissato Chief Business Operations Officer\n\n## Partnerships fit for the future\n\nOur ongoing success rests on working with many innovative and purposeful businesses and offering them a great experience. We know that while our suppliers value our sustainability ambitions and the relationships they have with us, they want Unilever to be quicker, simpler and easier to work with. In 2021, we improved our partner experience through a new integrated supplier helpdesk with a single point of contact and faster query resolution times. We'll be rolling out the helpdesk globally in 2022.\n\nWe continue to invest in technology to enhance our supply chain, with digital transformation allowing us to re-engineer production lines and apply automation and AI to be more responsive and resilient. We developed an award-winning Covid-19 dashboard which uses real-time data and machine learning to monitor and predict trends down to site level. This helped us identify and manage risks in our operations. We've also created a version of the dashboard to share with our supply chain partners.\n\nOur Virtual Ocean Control Tower also proved indispensable in mitigating the effects of the Suez Canal blockage in 2021, giving us real-time visibility of sea cargo location, container details and estimated time of arrival. This helps our logistics, planning and procurement teams minimise delays and makes our cross-border supply chain more efficient and resilient.\n\nIncreases in speed and agility must not, of course, come at the expense of product quality. So we also introduced a new digital process for addressing quality defects with our raw ingredient and packaging supply partners. This is allowing us to better track, analyse and manage quality issues, and we'll be rolling this out to all factories and supply partners in 2022. We know we need to bring more collaborative technology to our relationships with our suppliers, and are working to increase the speed and scale of platforms and processes like this one.",

        "page_content": "## Suppliers & business partners continued\n\n## From strategy to action\n\nOur direct suppliers are the gateway to the millions of people in our wider supply chain. So they're critical to building a more inclusive world, slowing climate change, and protecting natural resources. We simply can't do these things without them.\n\nWe've started to turn our strategy into action by working with our partners on pilots, roadmaps, capability building and information sharing. At the very end of 2020, we launched our Partner with Purpose programme to help us find innovative and impactful ways to deliver on our ambitious commitments with our supply partners and generate mutual growth.\n\nThroughout 2021, we held a series of global and marketspecific virtual events to share our strategy and commitments and recognise supplier contributions. In August, we launched our Partner Promise Programme to encourage suppliers to begin their own sustainability journeys, initially in three critical areas: climate, supplier diversity and living wage.\n\n## Reducing emissions through our supply chain\n\nIn 2020, we set out our ambition to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain by 2039. (a) This is a collective challenge, and an urgent one. Our suppliers bring critical climate action innovations to us. Through our partnership with Neste, for example, we're exploring new sources of renewable and recycled carbon for our cleaning product formulations. In June, we joined forces with Coca-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive in AB InBev's 100+ accelerator to push sustainable innovation in climate, water, packaging and sustainable agriculture in supply chains. We began five pilots to test innovations in sustainable packaging, water and energy - for example, converting food waste into animal feed in East Africa and repurposing brewery grains for packaging materials in China. We also take part in groups with similar ambitions, such as Transform to Net Zero and the Exponential Roadmap Initiative, to learn from others and share our own experience to help accelerate climate action in supply chains. For more on how we're working with our suppliers see page 53.\n\nSee our website for more on partnering with suppliers to deliver net zero\n\n## Dialling up diversity\n\nHaving a more diverse supply chain not only helps shape a fairer and more socially inclusive world - it allows us to unlock innovation and agility and better address the needs of our diverse consumers. Despite the volatility of the year, we made progress on our commitment to help our suppliers improve their own diversity and increase our spend with diverse suppliers. Our first step was to understand where we're starting from and begin tracking our spend. We ran our first global survey to map our spending with diverse businesses and are now working on validating our data and assessing which procurement categories should be prioritised. Our technology partner for finding new suppliers, scoutbee, has also added\n\ndiversity to its search criteria - reinforcing this as a critical element we look for in all potential suppliers.\n\nWe expanded our supplier diversity programmes in North America and South Africa and began new ones in seven other countries - the UK, Ireland, India, Thailand, Australia, Brazil and Kenya - where we'd identified conditions for good progress. For example, in the UK we're working with Google, Dow and WPP on an accelerator programme to empower diverse businesses. And in Kenya, we began partnering with International Finance Corporation (IFC) on Sourcing2Equal, a three-year project helping women-owned small and medium businesses access corporate procurement opportunities.\n\nWe spent \u20ac445 million with diverse suppliers in 2021, the first year of our ambitious goal to spend \u20ac2 billion annually by 2025. As a global commitment, this covers all markets many with little or no infrastructure for supporting diverse businesses. So in 2021, we also invited 450 of our closest supply partners to commit to growing their own workforce and supplier diversity in order to start growing the demand for more diverse businesses.\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nPartnerships based on clear standards of responsible sourcing strengthen our supply chain and the businesses within it. Our Responsible Sourcing Policy (RSP) sets out our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and with respect for universal human and labour rights as well as environmental sustainability. It's a crucial part of the due diligence we undertake to identify and encourage remediation by suppliers of issues within our extended supply chain.\n\nIn 2021, the proportion of our suppliers meeting the requirements of our RSP reached 81%. Our 2021 performance is not comparable to previous years as we now include new acquisitions that are not yet fully integrated into our systems. We risk-assess our suppliers against the RSP and require those we identify as high-risk to undergo an independent audit verifying they can meet our requirements. We require suppliers to put in place corrective actions to remedy any identified non-conformances so that they can remain compliant. This year, we improved the compliance process for new suppliers by ensuring that they only work with us once they confirm they can meet the requirements of our RSP. We're strengthening our process for existing suppliers to ensure we only raise new purchase orders for those who remain RSP compliant.\n\nWe're launching a refreshed RSP in 2022 with an expanded focus on climate and nature - and a new requirement for suppliers to pay a living wage, which will be introduced progressively across different portfolios until it is mandatory for all by 2030 - see page 30 for more on living wage.\n\nSee our website for more on responsible sourcing\n\n- (a) The definition of 'net zero' is outlined in our Climate Transition Action Plan.

The plan received overwhelming support, with 99.59% of votes in favour. For more detail on progress against our CTAP during 2021 and our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) statement, see pages 51 to 62.\n\nSee our website for more on climate action\n\n## A waste-free world\n\nWe're making progress towards our ambitious goals around virgin plastic reduction, recycled plastic use, making our packaging recyclable, and collection and processing of plastic. However, we know there is still a lot more to do. In just three years, we've increased our use of recycled plastic to approximately 17% of our total packaging portfolio (July 2020 to June 2021 - the reporting period for all our plastic metrics). Our end of 2021 forecast was around 20%, putting us well on track to meet our commitment of at least 25% recycled plastic by 2025.\n\nMany of our brands are now using high levels of recycled plastic in their packaging. In 2021, Hellmann's launched 100% recycled packaging in almost two-thirds of its markets. In Europe, Knorr has introduced bouillon tubs and lids made from 100% recycled material, Swedish Glace now offers its plant-based ice cream in food-grade and freezable recycled plastic tubs, and Persil comes in lighter bottles made with 70% recycled plastic. Dove uses 100% recycled plastic in its bottles in Europe and North America (where technically feasible) and 98% of its new refillable deodorant packaging in the US is made from recycled plastic.\n\nDue to our step up on recycled plastic, we've reduced our total virgin plastic packaging footprint since 2018 by around 16% to 599,000 tonnes. We have more projects than ever exploring\n\nless or no plastic. We're working with Pulpex to create the first- ever paper-based laundry detergent bottle, piloting this with OMO in Brazil. And we're expanding our in-store refill programmes, now in 11 countries, including refill stations in Asda and Co-op stores in the UK, and vending machines in India for Surf Excel, Comfort and Vim refills.\n\nCurrently, 53% of our packaging is recyclable, reusable or compostable. This is our actual recyclability rate (which is based on the EMF Global Commitment definition of 'recyclable'), which is significantly less than the 70% of our packaging portfolio that is technically recyclable with existing technology. This gap is an industry-wide challenge and is primarily driven by a lack of collection and recycling infrastructure. We're working with local governments and partners to close this gap, while we continue to deploy new materials and technologies. For instance, Signal, Pepsodent and Closeup are shifting to fully recyclable toothpaste tubes. In 2021 we rolled out recyclable flexibles in North America for Dove and Love Beauty and Planet. And in Vietnam, we launched a trial of recyclable sachets for CLEAR shampoo, with the aim of collecting and recycling the sachets for other uses.\n\nWe're also ramping up our collection and processing of postconsumer plastic waste. Our business in India was one of the first to help collect and process more plastic than it sold, and we have roadmaps for achieving this in other markets. We have more work to do to scale up our collection efforts. Industry partnerships will be key, such as our work with Mars, Mondel\u0113z, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo and UK retailers to incentivise the recycling of flexible packaging. In the US, we've made a $15 million investment in the Closed Loop Partners' Leadership Fund to help improve recycling. Advocacy is an important part of our plastics strategy. In January 2022, alongside more than 70 other businesses, we called for an ambitious and legally binding UN treaty to tackle plastic pollution on a global scale, similar in intent to the Paris Agreement.\n\nSee our website for more on plastic\n\nWe're also focused on reducing food waste. We're using predictive analytics and automation to better manage stock as well as apps to help chefs and caterers become more aware of food waste. Hellmann's continues its efforts to cut waste in homes and hospitality. Its #MakeTasteNotWaste campaign encourages quick and easy ways to use up leftovers, reaching more than 150 million people around the world. Hellmann's grew double-digit in 2021.

We've made progress in moving our sourcing footprint to areas of lower risk of deforestation. We're working towards reporting of low-risk deforestation volumes from 2022 and independently verified deforestation-free volumes from 2023. Our efforts in tackling deforestation and sustainable sourcing have been recognised by CDP, through our inclusion on the A List for Forests in 2021.\n\nDuring the year, we strengthened our contractual framework with key suppliers in palm and soy so we are working on aligned commitments. We created independent verification protocols and piloted these in our sourcing of palm oil, cocoa, and soy. We also expanded the coverage of our palm oil monitoring platform, which uses satellite imagery and geolocation data to measure deforestation in our supply chain. And along with NASA, Google, and others, we developed the Forest Data Partnership to collect data on forests and ecosystems.\n\nOur People & Nature Policy enhances our supplier requirements around no deforestation and human rights for our key commodities. We also published our Regenerative Agriculture Principles, guiding our suppliers and farmers, including smallholders, on how to nourish soil and water, capture carbon and restore land. By the end of 2021, we had 53,000 hectares under protection and regeneration in partnership with others. Brands like Knorr are playing a leading role in driving our regenerative agriculture programmes (see page 52).\n\nWater is essential for our business - the crops we grow, how we make our products, and how consumers use our brands. We're expanding our focus on water beyond our factory gates, starting with 12 factories in a number of water-stressed countries. We're also working with the 2030 Water Resources Group to address water security for consumers in Bangladesh, India, Brazil, South Africa and Vietnam. Ensuring our Home Care and Beauty & Personal Care products are biodegradable is another key part of our approach to water stewardship. We're working with suppliers and innovation partners to find alternative biodegradable ingredients that don't compromise on product performance. See page 23 for more.\n\nSee our website for more on nature and water\n\n## A fairer, more inclusive world\n\nWe're helping to build more resilient and equitable communities by raising living standards, advancing equity, diversity and inclusion and preparing people for the future of work.\n\n## Raising living standards\n\nSince 2020, we've continued to pay all our employees a living wage, and in 2021 were awarded our first global independent accreditation as a living wage employer from the Fair Wage Network.\n\nIn 2021, we made a groundbreaking commitment that everyone who directly provides goods and services to us will earn at least a living wage or living income by 2030. We're starting with our manufacturing and agriculture supply chain, where workers tend to be the most vulnerable. We're engaging our teams in the four markets with the biggest gap between the legal minimum wage and living wage in our supply chain. And we've begun engaging with our suppliers to understand their living wage position and how best to support and engage them.\n\nIn addition, we know there are many barriers to small businesses thriving, such as lack of access to skills, finance and technology. We've launched new programmes to move towards our goal to help 5 million small and medium-sized businesses in our retail value chain grow by 2025, reaching 1.2 million in 2021.\n\nSee our website for more on raising living standards\n\n## Equity, diversity and inclusion\n\nOur research shows that more progressive advertising has the potential to deliver 74% better brand power - a key measure of consumer attraction for brands. Through our Act 2 Unstereotype programme, we're integrating more diverse and inclusive thinking at every point of our marketing - to ensure it reflects the diversity of society. For examples of how our brands are working to shape a fairer and more inclusive world, see pages 21 and 31, and for diversity and inclusion in our workforce and supply chain, see pages 19 and 28.\n\n## The future of work\n\nWe're working to help young people find their purpose and match it with skills that will prepare them for the future of work - giving us access to talented young workers. Our LevelUp programme in South Africa for example, aims to break barriers to employment through purpose workshops, digital learning, mentoring and work experience. For more on how we're preparing our own people for the future of work, see pages 18 to 19.\n\nSee our website for more on the future of work\n\n## Improving health, confidence and wellbeing\n\nOur brands continued their work to promote health and wellbeing, inclusive beauty and positive nutrition - finding ways to power growth through purpose.",

Lifebuoy's purpose is preventing illness and saving lives through handwashing with soap. Its H for Handwashing education campaign has been teaching children about the importance of handwashing since its launch in 2020. And the Hygiene & Behaviour Change Coalition created by Lifebuoy, Domestos, the UK government and others has equipped many more to practise better hygiene. Lifebuoy also began offering free doctor teleconsultations on pack and through its communications across India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam. Our Pepsodent/Signal toothpaste brand also expanded its oral health services in Indonesia by providing free dental consultations via WhatsApp during Covid-19 restrictions, with other markets to follow in 2022. We see access to healthcare services as an important way to grow household penetration of our brands by providing vital services to communities.\n\nOur brands also expanded their efforts to improve confidence and wellbeing. Rexona deodorant extended its Breaking Limits programme to help young people in Brazil, the US and the UK overcome barriers to being active - funding community sports projects and access to coaches. Sunsilk continued its work to empower girls and young women through its Explore More programme with Girl Rising, which has reached more than 56,000 young people from underserved communities in six countries. Our brand-led initiatives helped to improve health and wellbeing and advance equity and inclusion for almost 700 million people in 2021.\n\nSee our website for more on improving health and wellbeing\n\n## Positive nutrition\n\nWe're continuing to increase the nutritional value and reduce salt, sugar and calories in our foods and refreshments. 63% of our portfolio met our WHO-aligned nutrition standards. Fortifying foods with micronutrients is another long-standing priority, now linked to our goal to double the number of products sold that deliver Unilever's standards for positive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus\n\nOMO: Purple carbon cleaning power\n\nWe've teamed up with biotech partners\n\nLanzaTech and India Glycols to capture carbon dioxide waste from steel factories and turn it into a climate-friendly cleaning ingredient. This 'purple carbon' technology - carbon captured from industrial emissions - has so far been used in OMO laundry liquid capsules in China and in Sunlight dishwashing liquid in South Africa. This is just one example of how we're reinventing the chemistry of our Home Care products to create growth opportunities for our brands\n\nwhile cutting the use of fossil fuels.\n\nnutrition by 2025 - including impactful amounts of vegetables, fruits, protein and fibre as well as micronutrients. At the end of 2021, 41% of our products delivered positive nutrition (per serving), keeping us on track towards our goal - see page 35 for more including our progress in reducing salt, sugar and calories.\n\nWe're using our voice to push for a sustainable food system, for example at the UN Food Systems Summit in 2021 where we called for a move to more plant-based proteins and more action on food loss and waste. We know there is more to do, but we're proud that our efforts are being recognised. We ranked first in the World Benchmarking Alliance's Food and Agriculture Benchmark and number two in the global Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI) Index, which ranks the nutrition programmes of the top 25 global food and beverage manufacturers.\n\nSee our website for more on positive nutrition\n\n## Respecting and promoting human rights\n\nRespect for human rights is at the heart of our business and the responsibility of every person in Unilever. We work with suppliers, peers, industry bodies, trade unions and civil society to address human rights impacts so that everyone connected to our value chain is treated with respect, dignity and fairness.\n\nIn support of our commitment to respect and promote human rights and the effective implementation of the UN Guiding Principles, in 2021 we created a framework to enable us to address human rights issues consistently and effectively. We're using it to define a theory of change, and action plans which include capability building and impact assessment metrics to measure progress. We used the framework to implement capability building on responsible recruitment for our suppliers - which includes an e-learning platform and toolkit - and our procurement teams.\n\nOur Human Rights Reports explain our progress and the due diligence we've undertaken in tackling the many human rights challenges such as forced labour, gender-based violence and living wages.\n\nWe continued to work on women's inclusion and safety in agriculture, manufacturing and last-mile distribution. We'll be introducing safety frameworks in priority regions and making sure our direct suppliers have policies and processes in place to support inclusion and address sexual and gender-based violence.\n\nSee our website for more on human rights",

For details and 2020 Basis of Preparation, see www.unilever.com/planet-andsociety/sustainability-reporting-centre/reporting-archive.\n- \u0394 This metric was subject to external independence limited assurance by PwC in 2019. For details and 2019 Basis of Preparation, see www.unilever.com/planet-andsociety/sustainability-reporting-centre/reporting-archive.\n- (a) Restated 2020 and 2019 figures due to a change in alignment of our renewable electricity reporting with the updated RE100 guidance. See page 51 for more information.\n- (b) This is a new metric which reflects the revised scope of our sustainable sourcing programmes. Previously reported sustainable sourcing metrics are not comparable.\n- (c) For the vast majority of products in scope, we have used the actual weight of plastic packaging sold to calculate this metric. For the remainder, we estimate the weight using the average packaging weight of similar products.\n- (d) For our 2018 baseline, we calculated the weight of plastic packaging sold for around half of products in scope. For the remainder, we estimated the weight of packaging sold by extrapolation using sales volumes.\n- (e) Refers to 'actual recyclability' of plastic packaging, meaning that it is both technically possible to recycle the material; and that there are established examples to recycle the material in the region where it is sold.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Underlying sales growth was 4.5%, there was a net positive impact of 1.3% from acquisitions and disposals and a negative currency impact of 2.4% driven by weakening of currencies in our key markets such as US, Turkey, Brazil and India. The growth was competitive and was delivered through focus on our strategic choices. Our thirteen \u20ac1 billion brands grew 6.4%. The US, India and China, three of our key growth markets, grew at 3.7%, 13.4% and 14.3% respectively. Our underlying sales growth in eCommerce (a) was 44%. The major challenge of 2021 was the significant rise of input costs. We responded with pricing actions, delivering underlying price growth of 2.9%. Covid-19 continued to impact the operating environment, with new variants resulting in restrictions in some of our key markets which impacted consumer and channel dynamics.\n\nAcquisition and disposal activities made a positive contribution of 1.3% to turnover. Our 2021 acquisitions included Paula's Choice and Onnit, helping to re-shape our portfolio into the high growth spaces of Prestige beauty and Functional nutrition respectively. On 18 November 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell our global tea business, ekaterra, to CVC Capital Partners Fund VIII for \u20ac4.5 billion on a cash-free, debtfree basis. More details on acquisitions and disposals are in note 21 on pages 161 to 163.\n\nEmerging markets underlying sales grew by 6.7%, driven by India and China. Latin America grew high-single digit, led by price. South East Asia declined following tough Covid-19 restrictions throughout the year. Developed markets underlying sales grew by 1.5% led by a competitive performance in US. Europe grew slightly from both price and volume.\n\nOperating profit was \u20ac8.7 billion which included \u20ac0.9 billion of non-underlying items, primarily restructuring costs and acquisition and disposal related costs. Restructuring costs of \u20ac0.6 billion are comprised of supply chain optimisation projects to improve gross margin and improve network agility, and organisational change projects to reduce overheads.\n\nUnderlying operating profit was \u20ac9.6 billion, an increase of 2.9%. This included an unfavourable currency impact of 4.3%. Underlying operating margin decreased by 10bps. Gross margin decreased by 120bps reflecting very high inflation in raw material, packaging and distribution costs globally. Brand and marketing investment and overheads contributed 90bps and 20bps to underlying operating margin respectively. There was an improvement in underlying operating margin when excluding currency impact. In line with our multi-year financial framework, we delivered savings of \u20ac2 billion and our profit growth was ahead of our underlying sales growth on a comparable basis.\n\nFree cash flow was \u20ac6.4 billion compared to \u20ac7.7 billion in the prior year. Low levels of capital expenditure and favourable working capital movements in 2020 were not repeated.\n\n- (a) eCommerce sales are defined as online sales made by Unilever to our consumers or customers either directly or through platforms as well as an estimate of our brands' sales through our customers' own websites.\n\n## Highlights for the year ended\n\nBeauty & Personal Care\n\nFoods & Refreshment\n\nHome Care\n\nGroup\n\n|                                         | 2021   | 2020   | 2021   | 2020   | 2021   | 2020   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Turnover (\u20ac million)                    | 21,901 | 21,124 | 19,971 | 19,140 | 10,572 | 10,460 | 52,444 | 50,724 |\n| Underlying sales growth (%)             | 3.8    | 1.2    | 5.6    | 1.3    | 3.9    | 4.5    | 4.5    | 1.9    |\n| Underlying volume growth (%)            | 0.8    | 1.2    | 2.9    | 0.1    | 0.7    | 5.1    | 1.6    | 1.6    |\n| Underlying price growth (%)             | 3.0    | -      | 2.7    | 1.1    | 3.1    | -0.6   | 2.9    | 0.3    |\n| Operating profit (\u20ac million)            | 4,471  | 4,311  | 2,937  | 2,749  | 1,294  | 1,243  | 8,702  | 8,303  |\n| Underlying operating profit (\u20ac million) | 4,742  | 4,591  | 3,477  | 3,257  | 1,417  | 1,519  | 9,636  | 9,367  |\n| Operating margin (%)                    | 20.4   | 20.4   | 14.7   | 14.4   | 12.2   | 11.9   | 16.6   | 16.4   |\n| Underlying operating margin (%)         | 21.7   | 21.7   | 17.4   | 17.0   | 13.4   | 14.5   | 18.4   | 18.5   |\n| Return on assets (%)                    | 166    | 140    | 84     | 69     | 172    | 129    | 123    | 102    |\n| Free cash flow (\u20ac million)              |        |        |        |        |        |        | 6,393  | 7,671  |",

Underlying sales growth was 3.8%, there was a net positive impact of 2.7% from acquisitions and disposals and a negative currency impact of 2.8%.\n\nAll categories delivered good growth apart from skin cleansing which declined following the elevated demand in the prior year. Skin care grew high-single digit with channels reopening in 2021. Vaseline performed strongly throughout the year, supported by several premium innovations across brightening, therapeutics and hydration. Deodorants grew as the market continued to recover, with good growth and restored competitiveness in North America. Rexona relaunched its core deodorant range with 72-hour non-stop protection against sweat and body odour. Hair care grew mid-single digit, with Sunsilk, Dove and CLEAR contributing and styling in North America restored to competitive growth. Dove grew highsingle digit and is now a \u20ac5 billion brand. Oral care grew with good performance in South Asia and Africa. Prestige beauty delivered strong double-digit growth in 2021 benefiting from eCommerce and a recovery in beauty channels compared to the prior year. New innovations in Prestige beauty include Dermalogica's biolumin-c and sound sleep cocoon and REN's zero waste packaging. Prestige beauty reached \u20ac1.0 billion turnover in 2021 if we include a full year of Paula's Choice. Functional nutrition (a) grew double-digit with good growth in Liquid I.V. and Olly, and reached \u20ac1.5 billion turnover if we include a full year of Onnit.\n\n- (a) Includes vitamins, minerals & supplements which is reported in Beauty & Personal Care and Health Foods Drinks which is reported in Foods & Refreshment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus\n\n## Our multi-year financial framework\n\nWe will deliver long-term value creation by continuing to evolve our portfolio and driving earnings growth, a strong cash flow and a growing dividend. We expect to do this through:\n\n- \u25aa Underlying sales growth ahead of our markets, delivering USG in the range of 3% to 5%\n- \u25aa Profit growth ahead of sales growth, on a comparable basis\n- \u25aa Sustained strong cash flow over the long term\n- \u25aa Savings of \u20ac2 billion per year from our well-established Fuel for Growth savings programmes\n- \u25aa Restructuring investment of around \u20ac1 billion for 2021 and 2022; lower thereafter\n- \u25aa Return on invested capital (ROIC) in the mid-to-high teens\n- \u25aa Net debt to underlying EBITDA at around 2x\n\nUnderlying operating profit increased by \u20ac151 million. This was due to a \u20ac169 million impact from the growth in turnover and \u20ac18 million due to negative gross margin particularly impacted by high material inflation in palm oil. This was partially offset by reduction in brand and marketing investment although we benefited from efficiencies in advertising production costs. Non-underlying items were \u20ac271 million, \u20ac9 million lower than the prior year due to lower restructuring costs. Operating profit increased by \u20ac160 million.\n\n## Foods & Refreshment\n\nTurnover increased 4.3%. Underlying sales growth was 5.6%, there was a net positive impact of 0.6% from acquisitions and disposals and a negative currency impact of 1.8%.\n\nIce cream grew mid-single digit. Growth was driven by outof-home products, with in-home ice cream flat as we lapped double-digit prior year growth. Magnum and Ben & Jerry's each grew high-single digit. Ben & Jerry's is now a \u20ac1 billion brand. Our Ice Cream Now business which catered to the rise of 'in-home' eating by quickly delivering our brands to consumers in 35 countries, grew 60% in 2021. Food solutions recovered well, with double-digit growth, although Covid-19 variants continued to drive uncertainty in the out-of-home channel. In-home savoury saw a slight decline in growth, following elevated demand in the prior year. Our largest food brand Knorr grew high-single digit across in-home and outof-home channels through innovations such as zero salt stock cubes and Rinde M\u00e1s in Latin America, a plant-based product that extends the yield of meat dishes while adding flavour. Dressings brand Hellmann's grew double-digit for the second consecutive year. Our retained tea business grew double-digit.\n\nUnderlying operating profit increased by \u20ac220 million. This was due to a \u20ac141 million impact from the growth in turnover and \u20ac79 million driven by lower overheads and brand and marketing investment as a percentage of turnover, despite a reduction in gross margin as a result of high input cost inflation. Non-underlying items were \u20ac540 million, \u20ac32 million higher than prior year due to step up in acquisition and disposal related costs partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Operating profit increased by \u20ac188 million.\n\n## Home Care\n\nTurnover increased 1.1%. Underlying sales growth was 3.9% with a negative currency impact of 2.6%.\n\nIn fabric care, mid single-digit growth in fabric cleaning and low-single digit growth in fabric enhancers was led by South Asia and Latin America. We continued to see good innovation performance from dilutable laundry liquids across Latin America, under the OMO brand. Capsule and liquid formats continued to grow well, and in China OMO became the leading capsules brand in traditional retail and second-largest in eCommerce. Underlying sales in home and hygiene declined mid-single digit as we lapped strong performance for hygiene products in 2020, but home and hygiene continued to trade ahead of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nUnderlying operating profit decreased by \u20ac102 million. This was due to a \u20ac16 million positive impact from the growth in turnover which was more than offset by \u20ac118 million impact from reduction in gross margin as a result of high cost inflation. This was partially offset by lower brand and marketing investment, following a step up in 2020 as we invested behind high demand hygiene categories. Non-underlying items were \u20ac123 million, \u20ac153 million lower than prior year due to lower restructuring costs. Operating profit increased by \u20ac51 million.",

Capital expenditure increased in 2021 following investment returning to normal levels.\n\nNet cash flow used in financing activities was \u20ac7.1 billion compared to \u20ac5.8 billion in the prior year primarily due to \u20ac3 billion share buybacks. In 2021 borrowings net of repayments was \u20ac1.6 billion higher than in the prior year primarily to support the share buybacks.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\n|                                | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Goodwill and intangible assets | 38,591           | 34,941           |\n| Other non-current assets       | 19,103           | 16,561           |\n| Current assets                 | 17,401           | 16,157           |\n| Total assets                   | 75,095           | 67,659           |\n| Current liabilities            | 24,778           | 20,592           |\n| Non-current liabilities        | 30,571           | 29,412           |\n| Total liabilities              | 55,349           | 50,004           |\n| Shareholders' equity           | 17,107           | 15,266           |\n| Non-controlling interest       | 2,639            | 2,389            |\n| Total equity                   | 19,746           | 17,655           |\n| Total liabilities and equity   | 75,095           | 67,659           |\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets were \u20ac38.6 billion. This was an increase of \u20ac3.7 billion compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by acquisitions which contributed \u20ac2.5 billion and a positive impact from currency of \u20ac1.9 billion offset by movement of \u20ac0.9 billion of goodwill and intangible assets relating to classifying ekaterra as held for sale. The Paula's Choice acquisition was the primary driver of the increase in goodwill and intangible assets. Total consideration paid was \u20ac1,832 million comprised of \u20ac1,818 million cash paid on the completion date and \u20ac14 million of deferred consideration. Intangible assets and goodwill arising from this acquisition were \u20ac1.6 billion and \u20ac0.6 billion respectively. See note 21 on pages 161 to 163 for more.\n\nOther non-current assets increased by \u20ac2.5 billion primarily as a result of positive investment returns on pension assets. Current assets increased by \u20ac1.2 billion primarily due to the classification of ekaterra assets under held for sale offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac2.1 billion driven by share buybacks.\n\nNon-controlling interest increased by \u20ac0.3 billion driven by an increase in profits.\n\n## Net debt\n\nClosing net debt was \u20ac25.5 billion compared to \u20ac20.9 billion as at 31 December 2020 driven by lower free cash flow, the share buybacks and acquisitions including Paula's Choice. Net debt to underlying earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (UEBITDA) was 2.2x as at 31 December 2021 versus 1.8x in the prior year. Underlying EBITDA means operating profit before the impact of depreciation, amortisation and non-underlying items within operating profit. This is primarily used to assess our leverage level as referenced in the multi-year financial framework.\n\n## Movement in net pension liability/asset\n\nThe table below shows the movement in net pension liability/ asset during the year. Pension assets net of liabilities were in surplus of \u20ac3.0 billion at the end of 2021 compared with a surplus of \u20ac0.3 billion at the end of 2020. The increase was driven by positive investment returns on pension assets. Liabilities remained unchanged overall, with a decrease from higher interest rates offsetting an increase due to higher inflation.\n\n|                                                   | \u20ac million 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| 1 January                                         | 287              |\n| Current service cost                              | (228)            |\n| Employee contributions                            | 13               |\n| Actual return on plan assets (excluding interest) | 1,958            |\n| Net interest cost                                 | (10)             |\n| Actuarial loss                                    | 464              |\n| Employer contributions                            | 394              |\n| Currency retranslation                            | 127              |\n| Other movements (a)                               | (12)             |\n| 31 December                                       | 2,993            |",

These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third-party borrowings. We maintain access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short and longterm debt programmes. We make use of plain vanilla derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to help mitigate risks. More detail is provided in notes 16, 16A, 16B and 16C on pages 149 to 155. The remaining \u20ac3 billion (or 89%) of the Group's cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis. For most countries, this is done through dividends which are in some cases subject to withholding or distribution tax. This balance includes \u20ac83 million (2020: \u20ac98 million, 2019: \u20ac146 million) of cash that is held in a few countries where we face cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions that inhibit our ability to make these balances available in any means for general use by the wider business. The cash will generally be invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other capital resources available to the Group, does not significantly affect the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations. We closely monitor all our exposures and counter-party limits. Unilever has committed credit facilities in place for general corporate purposes. The undrawn bilateral committed credit facilities in place on 31 December 2021 were $7,965 million. Additional bilateral undrawn revolving 364-day credit facilities of \u20ac1,500 million were signed in December 2021. Further information on liquidity management is set out in note 16A to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Material cash commitments from contractual and other obligations\n\nThe following table shows the amount of our contractual and other obligations as at 31 December 2021. The material cash commitments from contractual and other obligations arise from our borrowings which include bonds, commercial paper, bank and other loans, interest on these borrowings and trade payables and accruals.\n\n|                                                            | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million Due  within 1  year   | \u20ac million Due in 1-3 years   | \u20ac million Due in 3-5 years   | \u20ac million Due in  over 5  years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Bonds                                                      | 23,892           | 2,359                           | 5,091                        | 4,529                        | 11,913                            |\n| Commercial paper,  bank and other  loans                   | 4,357            | 4,338                           | 13                           | -                            | 6                                 |\n| Interest on  financial liabilities                         | 3,564            | 451                             | 797                          | 639                          | 1,677                             |\n| Trade payables  and accruals                               | 14,443           | 14,320                          | 68                           | 22                           | 33                                |\n| Lease liabilities                                          | 1,939            | 426                             | 621                          | 404                          | 488                               |\n| Other lease  commitments                                   | 159              | 56                              | 53                           | 27                           | 23                                |\n| Purchase  obligations (a)  &  other long-term  commitments | 2,561            | 885                             | 715                          | 460                          | 501                               |\n| Others  (b)                                                | 589              | 163                             | 218                          | 208                          | -                                 |\n| Total                                                      | 51,504           | 22,998                          | 7,576                        | 6,289                        | 14,641                            |\n\n- (a) For raw and packaging materials and finished goods.\n- (b) Includes other financial liabilities and deferred consideration for acquisitions.\n\nFurther details are set out in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: note 10 on pages 138 to 140, note 15C on page 147 and 148, and note 20 on page 160 and 161. We are satisfied that our financing arrangements are adequate to meet our short term and long term cash requirements. In relation to the facilities available to the Group, borrowing requirements do not fluctuate materially during the year and are not seasonal.\n\n## Guaranteed US debt securities\n\nAt 31 December 2021 the Group had in issue US$12.1 billion (2020: US$11.5 billion; 2019: US$12.35 billion) bonds in connection with a US shelf registration. See page 198 for more information on these bonds and related commentary on guarantor information.\n\n## Non-GAAP measures\n\nCertain discussions and analyses set out in this Annual Report and Accounts (and the Additional Information for US Listing Purposes) include measures which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as IFRS. We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring our operating performance, and our ability to retire debt and invest in new business opportunities. Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating performance and value creation. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Wherever appropriate and practical, we provide reconciliation to relevant GAAP measures.\n\n## Explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures\n\nUnilever uses 'constant rate' and 'underlying' measures primarily for internal performance analysis and targeting purposes. We present certain items, percentages and movements, using constant exchange rates, which exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency values by translating both the current and the prior period local currency amounts using the prior year average exchange rates into euro, except for the local currency of entities that operate in hyperinflationary economies. These currencies are translated into euros using the prior year closing exchange rate before the application of IAS 29.\n\nThe table below shows exchange rate movements in our key markets.\n\nAnnual average\n\nAnnual average\n\n|                              |   rate in 2021 |   rate in 2020 |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Brazilian real (\u20ac1 = BRL)    |          6.366 |          5.781 |\n| Chinese yuan (\u20ac1 = CNY)      |          7.663 |          7.862 |\n| Indian rupee (\u20ac1 = INR)      |         87.599 |         84.1   |\n| Indonesia rupiah (\u20ac1 = IDR)  |      16983     |      16557     |\n| Philippine peso (\u20ac1 = PHP)   |         58.401 |         56.447 |\n| UK pound sterling (\u20ac1 = GBP) |          0.861 |          0.888 |\n| US dollar (\u20ac1 = US$)         |          1.187 |          1.135 |",

        "page_content": "## Financial review continued\n\nIn the following sections we set out our definitions of the following non-GAAP measures and provide reconciliation to relevant GAAP measures:\n\n- \u25aa underlying volume growth;\n- \u25aa underlying sales growth;\n- \u25aa underlying price growth;\n- \u25aa underlying earnings per share;\n- \u25aa non-underlying items;\n- \u25aa underlying operating profit and underlying operating margin;\n- \u25aa constant underlying earnings per share;\n- \u25aa underlying effective tax rate;\n- \u25aa free cash flow;\n- \u25aa net debt; and\n- \u25aa return on assets;\n- \u25aa return on invested capital.\n\n## Underlying sales growth\n\nUnderlying sales growth (USG) refers to the increase in turnover for the period, excluding any change in turnover resulting from acquisitions, disposals, changes in currency and price growth in excess of 26% in hyperinflationary economies. Inflation of 26% per year compounded over three years is one of the key indicators within IAS 29 to assess whether an economy is deemed to be hyperinflationary. We believe this measure provides valuable additional information on the underlying sales performance of the business and is a key measure used internally. The impact of acquisitions and disposals is excluded from USG for a period of 12 calendar months from the applicable closing date. Turnover from acquired brands that are launched in countries where they were not previously sold is included in USG as such turnover is more attributable to our existing sales and distribution network than the acquisition itself.\n\nThe reconciliation of changes in the GAAP measure of turnover to USG is as follows:\n\nBeauty &\n\nFoods &\n\n| 2021 vs 2020 (%)                                      | Personal Care   | Refreshment   | Home Care   | Group   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|---------|\n| Turnover growth (a)                                   | 3.7             | 4.3           | 1.1         | 3.4     |\n| Effect of acquisitions                                | 2.7             | 0.8           | -           | 1.4     |\n| Effect of disposals                                   | -               | (0.2)         | (0.1)       | (0.1)   |\n| Effect of currency-related items,                     | (2.8)           | (1.8)         | (2.6)       | (2.4)   |\n| of which:                                             |                 |               |             |         |\n| Exchange rate changes                                 | (3.0)           | (2.1)         | (2.9)       | (2.6)   |\n| Extreme price growth in hyperinflationary markets (b) | 0.2             | 0.3           | 0.3         | 0.3     |\n| Underlying sales growth (b)                           | 3.8             | 5.6           | 3.9         | 4.5     |\n| 2020 vs 2019 (%)                                      |                 |               |             |         |\n| Turnover growth (a)                                   | (3.4)           | (0.8)         | (3.4)       | (2.4)   |\n| Effect of acquisitions                                | 0.9             | 2.7           | 0.2         | 1.4     |\n| Effect of disposals                                   | -               | (0.4)         | (0.2)       | (0.2)   |\n| Effect of currency-related items,                     | (5.4)           | (4.2)         | (7.5)       | (5.4)   |\n| of which:                                             |                 |               |             |         |\n| Exchange rate changes                                 | (5.6)           | (4.6)         | (7.8)       | (5.7)   |\n| Extreme price growth in hyperinflationary markets (b) | 0.2             | 0.5           | 0.3         | 0.3     |\n| Underlying sales growth (b)                           | 1.2             | 1.3           | 4.5         | 1.9     |\n| 2019 vs 2018 (%)                                      |                 |               |             |         |\n| Turnover growth (a)                                   | 6.0             | (4.6)         | 6.9         | 2.0     |\n| Effect of acquisitions                                | 0.9             | 0.6           | 0.3         | 0.7     |\n| Effect of disposals                                   | -               | (7.5)         | -           | (3.0)   |\n| Effect of currency-related items,                     | 2.4             | 1.0           | 0.4         | 1.5     |\n| of which:                                             |                 |               |             |         |\n| Exchange rate changes                                 | 1.7             | (3.5)         | (0.3)       | (0.7)   |\n| Extreme price growth in hyperinflationary markets (b) | 0.6             | 4.7           | 0.7         | 2.2     |\n| Underlying sales growth (b)                           | 2.6             | 1.5           | 6.1         | 2.9     |\n\n## Underlying price growth\n\nUnderlying price growth (UPG) is part of USG and means, for the applicable period, the increase in turnover attributable to changes in prices during the period. UPG therefore excludes the impact to USG due to (i) the volume of products sold; and (ii) the composition of products sold during the period. In determining changes in price we exclude the impact of price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies as explained in USG above.\n\n## Underlying volume growth\n\nUnderlying volume growth (UVG) is part of USG and means, for the applicable period, the increase in turnover in such period calculated as the sum of (i) the increase in turnover attributable to the volume of products sold; and (ii) the increase in turnover attributable to the composition of products sold during such period. UVG therefore excludes any impact on USG due to changes in prices.",

Underlying operating profit represents our measure of segment profit or loss as it is the primary measure used for making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the segments.\n\nThe Group reconciliation of operating profit to underlying operating profit is as follows:\n\n|                                                            | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Operating profit                                           | 8,702            | 8,303            | 8,708            |\n| Non-underlying items within operating  profit (see note 3) | 934              | 1,064            | 1,239            |\n| Underlying operating profit                                | 9,636            | 9,367            | 9,947            |\n| Turnover                                                   | 52,444           | 50,724           | 51,980           |\n| Operating margin                                           | 16.6%            | 16.4%            | 16.8%            |\n| Underlying operating margin                                | 18.4%            | 18.5%            | 19.1%            |\n\nFurther details of non-underlying items can be found in note 3 on page 124 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nRefer to note 2 on page 121 for the reconciliation of operating profit to underlying operating profit by division. For each division, operating margin is computed as operating profit divided by turnover and underlying operating margin is computed as underlying operating profit divided by turnover.\n\n## Underlying earnings per share\n\nUnderlying earnings per share (underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity divided by the diluted average number of ordinary shares. In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity, net profit attributable to shareholders' equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items. This measure reflects the underlying earnings for each share unit of the Group. Refer to note 7 for reconciliation of net profit attributable to shareholders' equity to underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity.\n\n## Underlying effective tax rate\n\nThe underlying effective tax rate is calculated by dividing taxation excluding the tax impact of non-underlying items by profit before tax excluding the impact of non-underlying items and share of net profit/(loss) of joint ventures and associates. This measure reflects the underlying tax rate in relation to profit before tax excluding non-underlying items before tax and share of net (profit)/loss of joint ventures and associates.\n\nTax impact on non-underlying items within operating profit is the sum of the tax on each non-underlying item, based on the applicable country tax rates and tax treatment.\n\nThis is shown in the table:\n\n|                                                                                                                               | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Taxation                                                                                                                      | 1,935            | 1,923            |\n| Tax impact of:                                                                                                                |                  |                  |\n| Non-underlying items within operating profit (a)                                                                              | 219              | 272              |\n| Non-underlying items not in operating profit but  within net profit (a)                                                       | (41)             | (146)            |\n| Taxation before tax impact of non-underlying                                                                                  | 2,113            | 2,049            |\n| Profit before taxation                                                                                                        | 8,556            | 7,996            |\n| Non-underlying items within operating profit  before tax (a)                                                                  | 934              | 1,064            |\n| Non-underlying items not in operating profit but  within net profit before tax                                                | 64               | 36               |\n| Share of net (profit)/loss of joint ventures and  associates                                                                  | (191)            | (175)            |\n| Profit before tax excluding non-underlying  items before tax and share of net profit/(loss) of  joint ventures and associates | 9,363            | 8,921            |\n| Underlying effective tax rate                                                                                                 | 22.6%            | 23.0%            |\n\n## Constant underlying earnings per share\n\nConstant underlying earnings per share (constant underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity at constant exchange rates and excluding the impact of both translational hedges and price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies divided by the diluted average number of ordinary share units.

The annual average is computed by adding the amounts at the beginning and the end of the calendar year and dividing by two.\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n| 2021                                         | Beauty &  Personal Care   | Foods &  Refreshment   | Home  Care   | \u20ac million  Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| Underlying operating profit before tax       | 4,742                     | 3,477                  | 1,417        | 9,636              |\n| Tax on underlying operating profit           | (1,070)                   | (785)                  | (320)        | (2,175)            |\n| Underlying operating profit after tax        | 3,672                     | 2,692                  | 1,097        | 7,461              |\n| Property plant and equipment                 | 3,956                     | 4,424                  | 1,967        | 10,347             |\n| Net assets held for sale                     | 2                         | 678                    | -            | 680                |\n| Inventories                                  | 2,157                     | 1,761                  | 765          | 4,683              |\n| Trade and other receivables                  | 2,264                     | 2,065                  | 1,093        | 5,422              |\n| Trade payables and other current liabilities | (5,957)                   | (5,726)                | (3,178)      | (14,861)           |\n| Period-end assets (net)                      | 2,422                     | 3,202                  | 647          | 6,271              |\n| Average assets for the period (net)          | 2,206                     | 3,219                  | 638          | 6,063              |\n| Division return on assets                    | 166%                      | 84%                    | 172%         | 123%               |\n| 2020                                         |                           |                        |              |                    |\n| Underlying operating profit before tax       | 4,591                     | 3,257                  | 1,519        | 9,367              |\n| Tax on underlying operating profit           | (1,056)                   | (749)                  | (349)        | (2,154)            |\n| Underlying operating profit after tax        | 3,535                     | 2,508                  | 1,170        | 7,213              |\n| Property plant and equipment                 | 3,763                     | 4,895                  | 1,900        | 10,558             |\n| Net assets held for sale                     | 2                         | 10                     | 15           | 27                 |\n| Inventories                                  | 1,817                     | 1,894                  | 751          | 4,462              |\n| Trade and other receivables                  | 2,057                     | 1,864                  | 1,018        | 4,939              |\n| Trade payables and other current liabilities | (5,649)                   | (5,428)                | (3,055)      | (14,132)           |\n| Period-end assets (net)                      | 1,990                     | 3,235                  | 629          | 5,854              |\n| Average assets for the period (net)          | 2,523                     | 3,614                  | 906          | 7,043              |\n| Division return on assets                    | 140%                      | 69%                    | 129%         | 102%               |\n\n## Other information\n\n## Accounting standards and critical accounting policies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the UK and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

        "page_content": "## Our risks\n\n## Our risk appetite and approach to risk management\n\nRisk management is integral to Unilever's strategy and to the achievement of Unilever's long-term goals. Our success as an organisation depends on our ability to identify and exploit the opportunities generated by our business and in our markets. In doing this, we take an embedded approach to risk management which puts risk and opportunity assessment at the core of the Board agenda, which is where we believe it should be.\n\nUnilever's appetite for risk is driven by the following:\n\n- \u25aa Our growth should be consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible.\n- \u25aa Our behaviours must be in line with our Code of Business Principles and Code Policies.\n- \u25aa Our actions on issues such as plastic and climate change must reflect their urgency, and not be constrained by the uncertainty of potential impacts.\n- \u25aa Our ambition to continuously improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness.\n- \u25aa Our aim to maintain a minimum A/A2 credit rating on a longterm basis.\n\nOur approach to risk management is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that our assets are safeguarded, the risks facing the business are being assessed and mitigated, and all information that may be required to be disclosed is reported to Unilever's senior management including, where appropriate, the CEO and CFO.\n\n## Organisation\n\nThe Board has overall accountability for the management of risk and for reviewing the effectiveness of Unilever's risk management and internal control systems. The Board has established a clear organisational structure with well-defined accountabilities for the principal risks that Unilever faces in the short, medium and long term. This organisational structure and distribution of accountabilities and responsibilities ensure that every country in which we operate has specific resources and processes for risk reviews and risk mitigation. This is supported by the ULE, which takes active responsibility for focusing on the principal areas of risk to Unilever. The Board regularly review these risk areas, including consideration of environmental, social and governance matters, and retain responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks that Unilever is prepared to take to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\n## Foundation and principles\n\nUnilever's approach to doing business is framed by our purpose and values (see pages 8 to 9). Our Code of Business Principles sets out the standards of behaviour that we expect all employees to adhere to. Day-to-day responsibility for ensuring these principles are applied rests with senior management across Divisions, geographies and functions.\n\nA network of Business Integrity Officers and Committees supports the activities necessary to communicate the Code, deliver training, maintain processes and procedures (including support lines) to report and respond to alleged breaches, and to capture and communicate learnings.\n\nWe have a framework of Code Policies that underpins the Code of Business Principles and sets out the non-negotiable standards of behaviour expected from all our employees.\n\nFor each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place and who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating that risk. Unilever's functional standards define mandatory requirements across a range of specialist areas, which are key controls in mitigating these risks. Examples include health and safety, accounting and reporting, and financial risk management.\n\nOur assessment of risk considers both short- and long-term risks, including how these risks are changing, together with emerging risk areas. These are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and formally by senior management and the Board at least once a year.\n\n## Processes\n\nUnilever operates a wide range of processes and activities across all its operations covering strategy, planning, execution and performance management. Risk management is integrated into every stage.\n\n## Assurance and re-assurance\n\nAssurance on compliance with the Code of Business Principles and all of our Code Policies is obtained annually from Unilever management via a formal Code declaration. In addition, there are specialist awareness and training programmes which are run throughout the year and vary depending on the business priorities. These specialist compliance programmes supplement the Code declaration. Our Corporate Audit function plays a vital role in providing to both management and the Board an objective and independent review of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems throughout Unilever.\n\n## Board assessment of compliance with the risk management frameworks\n\nThe Board, advised by the Committees where appropriate, regularly review the significant risks and decisions that could have a material impact on Unilever. These reviews consider the level of risk that Unilever is prepared to take in pursuit of the business strategy and the effectiveness of the management controls in place to mitigate the risk exposure.\n\nThe Board, through the Audit Committee, has reviewed the assessment of risks, internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures in operation within Unilever. They have also considered the effectiveness of any remedial actions taken for the year covered by this Annual Report and Accounts and up to the date of its approval by the Board.\n\nDetails of the activities of the Audit Committee in relation to this can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 78 to 79.\n\nFurther statements on compliance with the specific risk management and control requirements in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the US Securities Exchange Act (1934) and the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) can be found on page 77.",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement\n\nThe Directors have reviewed the long-term prospects of the Group in order to assess its viability. This review incorporated the activities and key risks of the Group together with the factors likely to affect the Group's future development, performance, financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities as described on pages 1 to 43. These factors have also carefully considered potential further implications of Covid-19. In addition, we describe in notes 15 to 18 on pages 144 to 159 the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk .\n\n## Assessment\n\nIn order to report on the long-term viability of the Group, the Directors reviewed the overall funding capacity and headroom available to withstand severe events and carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. This assessment also included reviewing and understanding the mitigation factors in respect of each principal risk. The potential financial impact of further Covid-19 related restrictions on both our\n\noverall funding capacity and our principal risks has also been considered given the wide range of potential outcomes. The risks and mitigating factors are summarised on pages 46 to 50.\n\nThe viability assessment has three parts:\n\n- \u25aa First, the Directors considered the period over which they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities,\n- \u25aa Second, they considered the current debt facilities and debt headroom over the viability period, assuming that any debt maturing can be re-financed at commercially acceptable terms; and\n- \u25aa Third, they considered the potential impact of severe but plausible scenarios over this period which included the potential ramifications that Covid-19 could have across the different areas of the Group, including:\n- \u25aa assessing scenarios for each individual principal risk, for example the termination of our relationships with the three largest global customers; the loss of all material litigation cases; a major IT data breach, reputational damage from not progressing against our plastic packaging commitments, the lost cost and growth opportunities from not keeping up with technological changes and increased operational costs from climate change; and\n- \u25aa assessing scenarios that involve more than one principal risk including the following multi-risk scenarios:\n\n| Multi-risk scenarios modelled                                                                                                                            | Level of severity reviewed                                                                                                                                                                        | Link to principal risk                                                  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Contamination issue with one of our products  leading to lower sales of products of this  brand and the temporary closure of our  largest sourcing unit. | Reduced sales in two of our Divisions was  considered along with damage to our largest  brand and disruption to supply chain.                                                                     | \u00b7  Safe and high-quality products \u00b7  Brand preference \u00b7  Supply chain   |\n| A major global incident affecting a key  sourcing unit and significant water shortages  in our key developing markets.                                   | The complete loss of all of our turnover in our  largest geographic market was considered  along with destruction of a key sourcing  unit and increased operational costs due to  water shortage. | \u00b7  Economic and political instability \u00b7  Supply chain \u00b7  Climate change |\n| Lack of progress against our plastic  packaging ambitions and the loss of our  three largest customers.                                                  | Significant reputational damage was  considered with the impact of losing our  three key customers.                                                                                               | \u00b7  Plastic packaging \u00b7  Brand preference \u00b7  Customer                    |\n| Cyber-attack causing a temporary shutdown  of our systems and the impact on profit  if management failed to deliver a major  transformation project.     | Loss of turnover for two weeks and ongoing  reputational damage and loss of confidence  from our customers and consumers.

None of the future outlooks considered resulted in significant liquidity headroom issues, primarily because:\n- \u25aa the Group has a healthy balance of short-term and long-term debt programmes, with repayment profiles ensuring short-term commercial paper maturities do not exceed \u20ac0.5 billion in any given week and long-term debt maturities do not exceed \u20ac4 billion in any given year\n- \u25aa the Group has $8.0 billion of committed credit facilities with a maturity of 364 days which are used for backing up our commercial paper programmes. Additional revolving 364 day facilities of \u20ac1.5 billion have also been taken out in 2021 to support liquidity headroom.\n- \u25aa Thirdly, for each of our 14 principal risks, worst case plausible scenarios have been assessed together with multiple risk scenarios. None of the scenarios reviewed, either individually or in aggregate would cause Unilever to cease to be viable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn the basis described above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.",

On the following pages we have identified the risks that we regard as the most relevant to our business. These are the risks that we see as most material to Unilever's business and performance at this time. There may be other risks that could emerge in the future. Climate change is a principal risk to Unilever as described on page 47.\n\nOur principal risks include risks that could impact our business in the short term (i.e. the next two years), medium term (i.e. the next three to ten years) or over the longer term (i.e. beyond ten years).\n\nOur principal risks have not changed this year. We also reflect on whether we think the level of risk associated with each of our principal risks is increasing or decreasing. There are three principal risks where we believe there is an increased level of risk compared with last year:\n\n- \u25aa Business transformation: there is an increase in the scale of projects in 2022, e.g. the disposal of ekaterra, new organisational model and the transformation of our core business processes to create a superior customer experience.\n- \u25aa Economic and political instability: heightened risk due to inflationary and supply chain pressures, possible withdrawal of state fiscal stimulus and differing recoveries from Covid-19 between countries.\n- \u25aa Systems and information: the cyber-attack industry is becoming increasingly professionalised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk                  | Risk description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Management of risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Level of risk   |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Brand  preference     | Our success depends on the value and relevance  of our brands and products to consumers around  the world and on our ability to innovate and  remain competitive.

Our acquisition and disposal activity is driven  by our portfolio strategy with a clear, defined  evaluation process.                                                                              | No change       |\n\nThe potential impact and likelihood of certain principal risks remain heightened due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These risks are the safety and wellbeing of our employees, continuity of operations, product relevance, channel capabilities and IT availability.\n\nBiodiversity loss has the characteristics of an emerging risk. A loss of forests and soil due to potential physical and regulatory risks could make future harvests more difficult and expensive in the long term (see pages 59 to 60).\n\nWe set out below certain mitigating actions that we believe help us to manage our principal risks. However, we may not be successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions. If the circumstances in these risks occur or are not successfully mitigated, our cash flow, operating results, financial position, business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. In addition, risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary from those described, which may include forward-looking statements, or could impact on our ability to meet our targets or be detrimental to our profitability or reputation.",

Our goals are to:\n\n- \u25aa Reduce in absolute terms our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 100% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline; (a) with an interim goal to achieve a 70% reduction by 2025 against a 2015 baseline.\n- \u25aa Halve the full value chain emissions of our products on a per consumer use basis by 2030 against a 2010 baseline. (b)\n- \u25aa Achieve net zero emissions covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2039. (c)\n\nIn the 2020s and 2030s, our primary focus will be to eliminate emissions in our operations and reduce emissions across our value chain (d) rather than purchasing carbon credits. It is too early to estimate the amount of any residual value chain emissions but our plan is to balance these with carbon removals to achieve and maintain our net zero emissions goal.\n\nWe fully expect our approach to delivering our commitments to evolve as science progresses and the societal debate on net zero matures. For example, we're currently considering the recently issued guidance from the Science Based Targets initiative on net zero targets.\n\nSee our website for our Climate Transition Action Plan\n\n## Our progress\n\nTo deliver the ambitious goals set out in our CTAP, we're focusing our actions in four key areas, which form the basis of this Annual Progress Report: our operations, our brands and products, our value chain and our wider influence on society.\n\n## Our operations\n\nOur first ambition is to eliminate operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our factories, offices and research labs which make up approximately 2% of our GHG footprint. We've reduced our operational emissions by 64% since 2015. This puts us on track to achieve our interim milestone of a 70% reduction by 2025 - see page 34 for our three-year performance. We're taking action in a number of areas to decarbonise our operations.\n\n## Eco-efficiency\n\nFor years we've invested in eco-efficiency projects across our factories, reducing CO 2 from energy per tonne of production by 77% compared to 2008 and by 14% versus 2020. Recent investments include improving energy efficiency of lighting and manufacturing equipment, and installing heat recovery systems. We've committed to align our future capital expenditure with the Paris Agreement. As a first step, in 2021 we developed a bespoke digital tool to capture the GHG, water and waste impact data of all capital expenditure projects.\n\n## Renewable electricity\n\nTransitioning to renewable electricity is a significant driver of emissions reduction in our operations. Our preference is to support local renewable energy markets through purchasing renewable electricity contracts called Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), or green tariffs/bundled Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to match our grid power demand, where these are available and can be sourced in a cost competitive way. Where this is not possible, and as the next best option, we seek to purchase unbundled RECs sold separately from electricity in the same market.\n\nOnly as a last resort, and when unbundled RECs are not available in a market where we buy electricity, do we buy unbundled RECs in an adjacent market.\n\nIn January 2020, we reached our target of purchasing 100% renewable grid electricity for our operations through a combination of PPAs and RECs (bundled and unbundled). Since we set this target, we've worked with the RE100 campaign to evolve industry best practice in renewable electricity reporting. From 2021, we're aligning our reporting with the updated RE100 guidance which requires us to make two changes.\n\nFirst, for renewable electricity certified with RECs, we will only report as 'renewable' the electricity where the accompanying RECs originate in the same market. While we intend to maintain our commitment to ensure our purchase of renewable grid electricity is matched by an equivalent volume of renewable electricity generation, we'll no longer count the purchase of unbundled RECs from an adjacent market in our renewable electricity reporting. While this will lower our reported renewable electricity percentage, we support the aims of RE100 to increase transparency in the global renewable power landscape, which we hope will help to accelerate the provision of renewable power in all markets.\n\nThe second change is to include non-grid sourced electricity. Currently, we use biomass in combined heat and power (CHP) boilers at a limited number of sites. As well as providing thermal energy (see below), they also supply our sites with electricity. From 2021 we'll include this within our renewable electricity reporting. We'll also include the renewable electricity generated at our factory sites, for example, the on-site solar installations in 24 countries. In 2021 we generated almost 3% of our total electricity from on-site renewable sources. Taking into account the updated definition and widened scope of our renewable electricity reporting, in 2021, 86% of our total electricity was from renewable sources. Against the new scope and definitions, the prior year would have been 80%. See page 56 for a more detailed breakdown of our electricity by source.\n\n## Renewable thermal energy\n\nIn addition to renewable electricity, we aim to transition heating sources (typically fossil-fuel-burning CHP boilers for hot air, water and steam) to renewable energy alternatives. By early 2020, we had stopped using direct coal on-site for thermal energy, except for three factories acquired in 2020",

In 2021, we eliminated direct coal from these three factories through the use of biomass and biodiesel. We're exploring options to eliminate indirect coal from steam supplied by third parties by 2030.\n\nWe're phasing out gas-fired boilers and exploring new renewable heating technologies such as heat pumps, concentrated solar power and lower carbon biogenic-derived sources. These technologies could provide up to half of our thermal energy needs by 2025. We have strict criteria to ensure we deliver genuine lifecycle carbon reductions. In 2022, we will publish details on how we'll ensure any biofuels we use do not lead to deforestation, compete with food supplies, and are sourced from local waste materials where possible.\n\nMany of the low-carbon heating options we're exploring are not yet commercially viable or widely available, so we're supporting innovation and looking for ways to trial them. We see hydrogen produced using renewable energy as a potential industrial scale low-carbon alternative to natural gas. Our Port Sunlight factory in the UK is supporting a trial of hydrogen technology.\n\n## Refrigerants\n\nWe're phasing out high-impact refrigerants from our operations, starting with the most harmful hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). When replacing these, we aim to use the greenest version available for the purpose needed. By the end of 2021 we had replaced HCFCs at 29 sites.\n\n## Food waste\n\nOur first priority is to reduce the amount of food waste we generate in the first place - we're aiming to halve food waste in our operations by 2025. This will also help to reduce our GHG emissions. By the end of 2021, we'd reduced food waste per tonne of food handled in our operations by 3% versus 2019. Our progress in reducing manufacturing food waste has been hampered by Covid-related disruptions. We're exploring solutions with our engineering teams such as anaerobic digestion, using the biogas generated on-site, composting and using the waste as fertiliser.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our brands and products\n\nDesigning our products to be lower carbon will help us to reduce our indirect Scope 3 footprint and strengthens the appeal of our brands to consumers. In some cases, it can also help consumers reduce their own footprint (see page 53). We're focusing on concentration and compaction, transitioning away from fossil fuels in our cleaning products, growing our portfolio of plant-based products and investing in climate and nature projects through our Climate & Nature Fund.\n\n## Concentration and compaction\n\nIn the last decade we've made significant emissions reductions by removing or reducing carbon-intensive materials such as inorganics and surfactants, and by concentrating and compacting our products. In 2021 we continued to develop concentrated formulas for our laundry liquids, including OMO in-home refills available in six markets and Seventh Generation's ultraconcentrated laundry formulation in the US. Lifebuoy also rolled out ten times concentrated ecorefill home cleaning spray in Europe.\n\n## Recycled and renewable carbon in formulations\n\nThrough our Clean Future programme, our Home Care laundry and cleaning brands are identifying new opportunities to shift to renewable and recycled ingredients, moving away from fossil-fuel-based ingredients. This year we launched an OMO liquid laundry capsule made from captured industrial carbon. Lifebuoy launched a cleaning range with plant-based ingredients in five countries. And OMO/Persil launched a new laundry liquid in 16 countries with plant-based stain removers. Read more about Clean Future on page 23.\n\n## Plant-based foods\n\nAlternative proteins, plant-based eating and meat and dairy alternatives are strategic pillars for our Foods & Refreshment division and all contribute to lowering carbon emissions. We're aiming to achieve \u20ac1 billion in sales from plant-based meat and dairy alternatives by 2025-2027 - through brands such as The Vegetarian Butcher, Wall's, Ben & Jerry's, Magnum, Knorr and Hellmann's. We're also encouraging people to use more plant-based ingredients in their cooking, through Knorr's 'Future 50' inspired plant-based recipes. Read more about plant-based foods on page 22.\n\n## Helping consumers make lower carbon choices\n\nAs well as ingredient transparency on product packs, we want our consumers to have clear information about the carbon footprint of the products they buy and we're exploring ways to provide this. After more than a decade of work assessing the carbon footprint of our products, we're now working with others across the value chain to standardise data collection protocols and communication frameworks. For example, we're part of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Value Chain Carbon Transparency Pathfinder initiative. And we're working with the Cosmetics Consortium to develop an industry-standard environmental impact assessment and scoring system.\n\n## Climate & Nature Fund\n\nOur \u20ac1 billion Climate & Nature Fund will help brands invest in projects that positively address climate change and protect nature - for example, through forest protection and regeneration. In 2021, we recruited a specialised team to lead this work, formulate the strategy and get started on project implementation. In this first year, we've committed",

        "page_content": "\u20ac40 million and are now building a pipeline of further projects. For example, Knorr will use the fund to support 50 regenerative agriculture projects. These are predicted to reduce GHG emissions and water use by an estimated 30% while improving biodiversity, soil health and livelihoods. As part of our Beauty & Personal Care's Positive Beauty strategy (see page 21), the Fund is working on innovative financing and collaboration partnerships to support the delivery of our commitment to protect and regenerate 1.5 million hectares of land, forests and oceans by 2030. This is more land than we use to grow renewable ingredients for the Division's products.\n\n## Our value chain\n\nOur value chain encompasses upstream and downstream Scope 3 emissions, excluding indirect consumer use-phase emissions (see page 53 for more on consumer use). Our focus is on tackling emissions from raw materials (including aerosol propellants), packaging materials, logistics and distribution networks, ice cream cabinets, and the disposal of waste products and packaging.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nWe've developed GHG reduction roadmaps for key materials and ingredients which contribute to our upstream Scope 3 GHG emissions, including dairy. Our roadmaps identify how we can reduce emissions through product reformulations, different raw materials and supplier innovation partnerships. It is particularly critical that we work in partnership with our suppliers as 1.5\u00b0C-aligned emission reduction pathways for the majority of these materials are still unclear and it is only through collaboration that we will find solutions.\n\nIn 2021, we invited our suppliers to commit to setting a public target to halve absolute GHG emissions by 2030, report their progress and share their data with us. We're exploring new ways to support suppliers through guidance, tools and resources, particularly for the 300 suppliers who have the most significant GHG emissions. In 2021, we began working with a small group to help us shape the programme, and we'll launch a pilot in 2022, before further roll-out in 2023. We're also encouraging other companies to work with their suppliers, for example through the 1.5\u00b0C Supplier Engagement Guide, launched by the 1.5\u00b0C Supply Chain Leaders initiative at COP26.\n\nWe cannot achieve our climate goals if our operations or supply chain contribute to deforestation. Our suppliers and other partners will play a critical role in helping us achieve a deforestation-free supply chain for five key commodities by 2023. Read more on tackling deforestation on page 30.\n\n## Packaging materials\n\nWe've set ambitious plastic commitments including to halve our virgin plastic footprint by 2025. Key to achieving this will be by increasing our use of recycled plastic. Our goal is to use at least 25% recycled plastic by 2025, and this year we achieved approximately 17%. We're also reducing our use of virgin\n\nplastic by shifting to refillable, reusable or naked (unwrapped) products which use less or no plastic. In 2021, we saw strong sales of concentrated home refill laundry and we continue to expand our in-store and at-home refill pilots, with about 15 in progress around the world. We're also exploring materials like paper and board, using life cycle analysis to ensure any switch away from plastic doesn't end up increasing our GHG footprint. Read more about plastic on page 29.\n\n## Logistics and distribution\n\nMore than 90% of our logistics emissions come from our logistics suppliers. We've begun using lower carbon alternative fuels such as liquified natural gas (LNG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) in 12 countries and piloted zero emission electric trucks with partners in three countries with plans to scale to more. We also signed up to a new shipping coalition, Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels (coZEV) to help accelerate the decarbonisation of the shipping industry.\n\nIn our own car fleet, we developed country roadmaps to achieve 100% electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrids by 2030, taking into account the availability of EVs, charging infrastructure and financial support or subsidies. In 2021, across six of the most EV-ready countries, EVs and hybrids made up 6% of the fleet.\n\n## Retail emissions\n\nIn 2021, all the new freezers we purchased to cool our ice creams in-store used lower carbon natural hydrocarbon refrigerants. We estimate that over 90% of the 3 million freezers in our fleet now use these refrigerants. We're investing in energy-efficient freezers, with the average energy use per cabinet falling by 3% compared to 2020. We're also looking at 'warming up' the cold chain so that less energy is needed to refrigerate products across their life.\n\n## Aerosol propellants\n\nWe typically use hydrocarbon propellant gases in hairsprays, body sprays and deodorants. In the US, our largest deodorant and hair market, Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) regulations restrict the use of formulations used elsewhere. Our primary focus has been to find regulatory solutions in the US to enable the use of alternative propellant systems which have a lower GHG footprint compared to hydrocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon propellants and help improve air quality. Provisions have been added to the US VOC regulations to allow the use of compressed gas propellants. We're now exploring alternative formulations and formats in key markets.\n\n## Disposal of waste products\n\nOur products have a GHG impact at the end of their life, as fossil-fuel-based ingredients break down and release emissions. We're switching to plant-based 100% biodegradable formulations across our Home Care portfolio. For example, Lifebuoy's BotaniTech range made from naturally derived and 100% biodegradable cleaning ingredients launched in five markets in 2021. And Comfort launched its Ultimate Care range, which contains new biodegradable technology to extend the life of clothes.",

        "page_content": "## Our wider influence on society\n\nWe're advocating for changes that will ultimately reduce the impact of our products when used by consumers as well as accelerating progress in other areas of our value chain.\n\n## Consumer use\n\nAround two-thirds of our products' GHG impact comes from their use by consumers (indirect downstream Scope 3 emissions), for instance from energy used by washing machines or hot water used for showering. There's a limit to how much we can influence emissions from product use as consumers make their own choices on how long they shower, which energy provider they use, and how efficient their home appliances are. We're therefore reliant, as many companies are, on the decarbonisation of the energy grid to reduce our downstream Scope 3 footprint. We're using our influence to advocate for system-wide change, such as acceleration of renewable energy globally, which will help reduce emissions in consumers' homes - see below for more on our advocacy.\n\nIn addition, we're committed to using technology and innovation to provide consumers with superior and lower carbon products while growing our business. This is already visible in Home Care's Clean Future strategy (with a focus on renewable and recycled carbon ingredients - see page 23), in Foods & Refreshment's Future Foods strategy (with a focus on plant-based foods - see page 22), and Beauty & Personal Care's Positive Beauty strategy (with a focus on sustainable sourcing, deforestation-free palm oil and nature-based solutions - see page 21).\n\nOur product lifecycle GHG emissions per consumer use have reduced by 14% since 2010 and by 4% since 2020, while our absolute Scope 3 emissions (from consumer use, ingredients and packaging and distribution and retail) increased by 1% versus 2020, as our sales increased over the same period. The reduction in GHG emissions per consumer use is driven by our Foods & Refreshment and Home Care Divisions, where emissions have fallen by 32% and 43% respectively since 2010. This is mainly due to grid decarbonisation, portfolio changes and product reformulation, such as the removal of phosphates in our laundry products. Over the same period, GHG emissions per consumer use from our Beauty & Personal Care Division have increased by 6% despite ongoing grid decarbonisation - driven primarily by the acquisition of brands with hair, bath and shower products which have high GHG emissions associated with consumer hot water use.\n\n## Advocacy\n\nWe were an early signatory to the We Mean Business open letter to G20 leaders calling for higher ambition ahead of the COP26 conference in 2021. Subsequently we partnered with the UK government as a Principal Partner of COP26 in Glasgow. Alan Jope served as a member of the COP26 Business Leaders Group to rally UK and international businesses. During the conference, we participated in numerous events including the World Leaders Summit, the Forest, Agriculture, Commodities and Trade (FACT) dialogue to reduce emissions in commodity value chains and events on creating high integrity standards for voluntary carbon markets. We also developed a climate advocacy toolkit to support our market teams to push for higher climate ambition.\n\n## Trade association policy alignment\n\nWe've committed to ensuring that all direct lobbying relevant to climate policy is consistent with the Paris Agreement. At the end of 2021 we published our climate policy position on our website for indirect climate lobbying. In 2021 we rejoined the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) to help accelerate the European chemical industry's transition towards circular chemistry. We will clearly indicate when CEFIC submissions on climate change-related policies do not align with our own climate positions.\n\nSee our website for our climate policy position\n\n## Industry partnerships\n\nWe continued our engagement with a selected group of international climate leadership strategic partners - the United Nations Global Compact, the World Economic Forum, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF). We initiated and co-chaired with Walmart a Race to Zero Task Force within the CGF to encourage other consumer goods and retail companies to join the UN's Race to Zero. This succeeded in doubling the number of CGF Board members making such commitments. We also helped to create a Transform to Net Zero guide for businesses.\n\n- (a) Our medium-term emissions reduction target has been recognised as sciencebased and consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C ambition of the Paris Agreement by the Science Based Targets initiative.\n- (b) Our medium-term full value chain emissions reduction target has been recognised as science-based and consistent with a 2\u00b0C temperature increase by the Science Based Targets initiative. It was set in 2010 and was validated by the Science Based Targets initiative before the 1.5\u00b0C validation was introduced. We plan to review this goal in the near future.\n- (c) Our long-term net zero value chain target covers upstream Scope 3 emissions, Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and mandatory downstream Scope 3 emissions. Mandatory downstream emissions include direct emissions from aerosol propellants and the biodegradation of chemicals in the disposal phase, but excludes indirect consumer use-phase emissions, such as emissions associated with hot water used with our products. This approach is consistent with the Science Based Targets initiative's approach to net zero targets. Our mediumterm value chain emissions reduction target covers indirect consumer usephase emissions. The definition of 'net zero' is outlined in our CTAP.\n- (d) In this CTAP Progress Report, as in the CTAP, references to 'our value chain' encompasses upstream and downstream Scope 3 emissions, but excludes indirect consumer use-phase emissions and operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions, unless stated otherwise. References to 'full value chain' in the context of our goal to halve our full value chain GHG emissions by 2030, additionally includes operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions and indirect consumer-use phase emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures statement\n\nThe following statement, which Unilever believes is consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures, details the risks and opportunities arising from climate change, the potential impact on our business and the actions we're taking to respond. We also integrate climate-related disclosures throughout this Annual Report and Accounts, including in our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) Progress Report on pages 51 to 56.\n\nSee our website for our Climate Transition Action Plan\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board takes overall accountability for the management of all risks and opportunities, including climate change (see page 44). Our CEO and Executive Board member, Alan Jope, is ultimately responsible for oversight of our climate change agenda. The Corporate Responsibility Committee and Audit Committee review our climate reporting and receive presentations from sustainability experts, including the Sustainability Advisory Council. The Board is supported by the ULE. The ULE meet quarterly to discuss key strategic matters. During 2021, three agenda items relating to climate change were discussed, including progress against our Compass climate goals.\n\nAdditional specialist governance groups are in place to support our climate agenda and ULE decisionmaking, including:\n\n- \u25aa Climate Action Committee: Drives delivery of our carbon ambition at corporate and country level and leads strategic partnerships and policy on renewables. Chaired by our Chief Business Operations Officer, Reginaldo Ecclissato.\n- \u25aa Sustainable Sourcing Steering Group: Supports our strategy focusing on long-term, sustainable access to our key crops. Chaired by our Chief Procurement Officer, David Ingram.\n\nThis year we engaged with shareholders on our climate strategy by seeking an advisory vote on our CTAP. We will continue to seek an advisory vote on our CTAP at our AGM every three years.\n\nExecutive remuneration for management employees - up to and including the ULE - continues to be linked to performance against climate change goals. Their reward packages include fixed pay, a bonus as a percentage of fixed pay and eligibility to participate in a long-term Performance Share Plan (PSP). The PSP is linked to financial and sustainability performance, guided by our Sustainability Progress Index (SPI), which accounts for 25% of the total PSP award. The SPI in 2021 is tied to a number of sustainability targets, including our progress on reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions in manufacturing, sustainable sourcing and recycled plastic - see page 92 for details. From 2022, the SPI will be linked to a new set of targets, including replacing fossil-fuel-derived ingredients in our\n\nlaundry and cleaning products with renewable or recycled carbon and our deforestation-free supply chain and recycled plastic commitments. See pages 87 to 88 for more on PSP including the role of the Board's Compensation Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee in determining how the PSP operates, and the SPI outcome each year.\n\n## Strategy and risk management\n\nClimate change is a principal risk to Unilever which has the potential - to varying degrees - to impact our business in the short, medium and long term. We face potential physical environment risks from the effects of climate change on our business, including extreme weather and water scarcity. Potential regulatory and transition market risks associated with the shift to a low-carbon economy include changing consumer preferences and future government policy and regulation. These also present opportunities. The potential impacts of climate change are taken into account in developing the overall strategy and financial plans.\n\nMore detail on these risks, opportunities and the mitigating actions we're taking can be found on pages 59 to 60.\n\nThe process for assessing and identifying climate-related risks is the same for the principal risks and is described on page 44. The risks are reviewed and assessed on an ongoing basis and formally at least once per year. For each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place, who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating it. We monitor risks throughout the year to identify changes in the risk profile.\n\nWe regularly carry out climate-related risk assessments at site level, supplier level, as well as innovation-project level. Climate-related risks are managed by the team relevant to where the risk resides. For example, climate risks in relation to commodities in the supply chain are managed by our procurement team.\n\n## Understanding financial impact: scenario analysis\n\nWe have conducted several high-level scenario analyses on the potential impacts of climate change to help us consider and adapt our strategies and financial planning. In prior years, we have reported the potential financial impacts of climate change on our business in 2030 if average global temperatures were to rise by 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This analysis led us to understand that limiting warming to 2\u00b0C would primarily expose us to economic and regulatory transition risks, whereas a 4\u00b0C warming level would expose us to unprecedented physical risks. In 2021, as new scientific evidence was released by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the global consensus around the need of governments to commit to a 1.5\u00b0C world strengthened, we extended our scenario analyses to assess the impacts of a 1.5\u00b0C temperature increase above pre-industrial levels by 2100 on our business in 2030, 2039 and 2050.",

        "page_content": "## Additional non-financial information continued\n\n## Understanding and modelling the potential financial impact on the business in 2030, 2039 and 2050 of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C\n\nThe IPCC's sixth assessment report (AR6), the most up-todate compendium from the global scientific community on climate change, states that limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels is necessary to prevent the severe environmental consequences that are likely to occur in a 2\u00b0C warmer world, and the catastrophic impacts that would materialise if temperatures rose by 4\u00b0C. However, it also noted that achieving a 1.5\u00b0C world would still imply major disruption and would necessitate a fast and aggressive transition of our global economy, encompassing policy and regulation, production and consumption systems, societal and economic structures and behaviours, and infrastructure development and deployment of new technologies.\n\nThe IPCC also sets out multiple pathways that the world could take to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The nature of the pathway taken significantly impacts the risks and opportunities that a business will face.\n\nIn assessing the material risks and opportunities Unilever would face in a world focused on achieving 1.5\u00b0C we have reviewed in detail two pathways, 'proactive' and 'reactive', that we assessed as more likely than other more extreme possible pathways. In the 'proactive' route, there is an early and steady reduction of emissions as a result of a fast response from all economic actors, meaning there is less dependence on technological advancements to remove carbon from the atmosphere in the second half of the century. Conversely, in the 'reactive' route, significant action by economic actors is delayed to 2030, after which a very rapid transition across all actors is required, accompanied by deployment at a very large scale of low-carbon energy and carbon removal activities and technology.\n\n## Risks and opportunities assessed in creating our 1.5\u00b0C scenario\n\nIn creating our 1.5\u00b0C scenario analysis, we took the two pathways and considered the five broad types of risks and opportunities using the TCFD risk framework: Regulatory risks; Market risks; Physical environment risks; Innovative products and services opportunities; and Resource efficiency, resilience, and market opportunities. We identified approximately 40 specific risk and opportunity areas which could impact us in 2030, 2039 and 2050, each of which we assessed qualitatively, supported where possible with high-level quantitative assessments. The assessments are based on financial scenarios and do not represent financial forecasts. They exclude any actions that we might undertake to mitigate or adapt to these risks.\n\nThe quantitative assessments were developed to understand high-level materiality and order of magnitude financial impact rather than perform detailed simulations or forecasts on the long-term future of markets and products. The data used was from internal environmental, operational, and financial data and external science-based data and assumptions from reputable and broadly used sources such as the IPCC or the International Energy Agency.\n\n## Climate scenarios: 1.5\u00b0C, 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pathways to 1.5\u00b0C: Proactive and Reactive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Proactive route\n\n- \u25aa Aggressive and persistent regulation from today\n- \u25aa Dramatic changes to lifestyle from today, towards minimising climate impact and social inequality\n- \u25aa Reliance on available and proven technologies\n- \u25aa Lower reliance on carbon removal technologies\n\n## Reactive route\n\n- \u25aa Gradual regulation by 2030, very aggressive post-2030\n- \u25aa Continuation of historical societal trends until 2030, then rapid pivot\n- \u25aa Major reliance on technologies that are not yet proven to scale\n- \u25aa Higher reliance on carbon removal technologies",

        "page_content": "## Key risks and opportunities\n\nOut of all the risks and opportunities we assessed, there are 11 which we believe are significant and we summarise these below. We have combined the outputs from the 'proactive' and 'reactive' analyses since the risks and opportunities are similar, with differences in the size and timing of impact. Where we have been able to quantify the risk, the ranges represent potential impacts of the different pathways.\n\nActions to mitigate the risks and capitalise on the opportunities have been consolidated into our Compass strategy (pages 8 to 11) and our CTAP (pages 51 to 56). Below we summarise the actions we're taking for each of the areas considered in our 1.5\u00b0C scenario assessments.\n\n## Regulatory risks:\n\n- \u25aa Carbon pricing includes carbon taxes and voluntary removal or offset costs. Tightening regional or national regulations as well as climate commitments across individual businesses could drive widespread implementation of these taxes or market schemes. This could translate into rising direct and indirect costs linked to carbon emissions, where the strongest impact would likely be on costs of sales linked to raw materials, production, and distribution emissions. Carbon taxes on household emissions or costs passed through to our consumers linked to household emissions may impact their disposable income and ultimately their purchasing power.\n- \u25aa Land use regulation could drive reforms to radically restructure current global land use patterns to conserve and expand forest land, serving as the main natural carbon removal solution. This could reduce land available for food crops, pasture, and timber and hence access to our primary commodities which could drive reduced crop output and increase raw material prices.\n- \u25aa Product composition regulations could restrict or ban the use of certain GHG intensive components and ingredients in everyday products. This would require the redesign of products and packaging to comply, which could increase costs.\n- \u25aa Sourcing transparency and product labelling regulations could increase significantly through pressure from regulators, consumers, and investors. This could lead to disclosure compliance risks and rising commodity costs linked to radical transition to transparent supply chains, as well as a potential loss of market share to more transparent competitors.\n- \u25aa Extended producer responsibility (EPR) would mean that producers are held accountable for their environmental and social impacts across the product value chain. This could lead to improvements of lifecycle traceability from sourcing to managing end-of-life treatment of products and packaging. Circular product design and manufacturing practices could become a requirement in many regions to incentivise efficient and responsible resource extraction, and pass waste management costs through higher disposal and recycling fees to producers.\n\nActions taken: We're mitigating regulatory risks through ongoing progress against the goals in our Compass and CTAP, notably our commitments on climate, deforestation and plastic packaging - see pages 10, 29 to 30 and 51 to 56. We support the use of carbon pricing as an important tool to help us achieve our zero emissions goal. Our carbon pricing approach is a mechanism which creates a sustainable capital investment fund which is then used to fund capital investments to decarbonise our operations. We support EPR policies and schemes and we're investing directly in waste collection, processing and capacity-building projects to recycle more plastic.\n\n## Market risks:\n\n- \u25aa Energy transition and rising energy prices could be driven by increased electrification, the deployment of renewable energy solutions, associated transmission, distribution and storage infrastructure, as well as the adoption of emerging low-carbon technologies such as biogas, green hydrogen and ammonia. This could impact our operations, suppliers, and end-consumers' utility costs.\n- \u25aa Energy and commodity market volatility could potentially lead to increased uncertainty in financial planning and forecasting for key commodities, as well as a higher cost associated with risk management. Other considerations include potential manufacturing or supply disruptions linked to availability or higher cost of energy and sourced commodities.\n\nActions taken: We're mitigating market risks by decarbonising our operations through eco-efficiency measures in our factories, powering our operations with renewables and transitioning heating and cooling for our factories to lower emission and renewable sources (see page 51). We manage commodity price risks through forward-buying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms.\n\n## Physical environment risks:\n\n- \u25aa Water scarcity would lead to increased droughts while limited resources to irrigate soils could reduce crop outputs. Water shortages could also impact our manufacturing sites and our ability to supply water-based products. Our consumers could also face water shortages in their everyday activities in certain regions, creating a need for water-smart or waterless products or services.\n- \u25aa Extreme weather events could significantly disrupt our entire value chain. Sustained high temperatures could lead to reduced crop outputs due to reduction in soil productivity which could translate into higher raw material prices. Weather events such as hurricanes or floods, which would become increasingly common and intense, could cause plant outages or disrupt our distribution infrastructure. Additionally, macroeconomic negative shocks among affected communities could reduce or destroy consumer demand and purchasing power.\n\nActions taken: We're mitigating physical environment risks by investing in new products and formulations that work with less water, poor quality water or no water. Many of our hair care products now have fast-rinse technology as standard, using less water. We're expanding our water stewardship programme to 100 locations in water-stressed areas by 2030 (see page 30). We monitor changing weather patterns on a short-term basis and integrate weather system",

To mitigate negative effects from extreme weather we have contingency plans to secure alternative key material supplies at short notice or transfer or share production between manufacturing sites. We manage commodity price risks through forward-buying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms. Our Regenerative Agriculture Principles and Sustainable Agriculture Code encourage our agricultural raw material suppliers to adopt practices which increase their productivity and resilience to extreme weather.\n\nIn addition to these risks inherent in the pathways to a 1.5\u00b0C world, there are also opportunities which would arise from emerging needs for products and services which are delivered sustainably at an appropriate price. There are two specific opportunities which this scenario analysis highlighted:\n\n## Innovative products and services opportunities:\n\n- \u25aa Growth in plant-based or lab-grown foods could increase rapidly in the coming years. As people become more environmentally conscious and there is regulation on land use, we could see a rise in plant-based diets away from animal-based protein.\n\nActions taken: We're capitalising on innovative product and service opportunities by offering a range of vegan and vegetarian products. We have a target to grow sales from our plant-based meat and dairy alternatives business to \u20ac1 billion per annum by 2025-2027 (see page 22).\n\n## Resource efficiency, resilience and market opportunities:\n\n- \u25aa Investment in energy transition technologies represents a shift to efficient and less centralised energy supply and consumption (e.g. through on-site renewable energy generation and storage), zero-emission logistics and designing products for resource-efficient consumption. This could drive decarbonisation across the value chain, while\n\nopening up the opportunity to access the utility market as an off-grid generator and create new revenue streams from grid balancing or demand side response services or providing excess renewable power of oversized capacity to supply chain partners.\n\nActions taken: We're capitalising on resource efficiency opportunities by generating renewable electricity at our factory sites where feasible (see page 51), targeting emissions reduction from our logistics suppliers and own vehicle fleet (see page 53) and through product reformulations which make our products more resource efficient in use - for example, many of our laundry products are now low-temperature washing as standard (see page 23).\n\n## Summary of high-level quantitative assessment\n\nFor those risks and opportunities where we have undertaken high-level quantitative assessments, the results are shown in the tables below. These assessments show the gross impact before any action which Unilever might take to respond. The ranges reflect the different results from the reactive and proactive pathways assessed.\n\nWe first undertook scenario analysis in 2017 on 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios. This year we have completed a 1.5\u00b0C scenario analysis. The results of this work on the way to 1.5\u00b0C is consistent with this previous work. The key differences are due to: the more extreme measures that would need to be taken to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C outcome; the evolution of the scientific assumptions contained within the IPCC's AR6 report; and a more detailed approach to the scenario analysis. The financial impact in 2030 is more significant in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario. However, the scenario avoids the greater negative impacts from the physical risks associated with higher temperature rise scenarios in 2050 and beyond.",

The next level of impact would be as a result of the transition of the energy system with rising energy prices and market volatility. We would also experience the impact of physical environment risks associated with a warmer climate, even in a 1.5\u00b0C world. While the potential risks and financial impact of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C are significant if no mitigating actions are taken, the impact of the potential risks that would exist if we were not to reduce warming to 1.5\u00b0C are potentially even more significant.\n\nThe outcomes from our analysis provide us with initial high-level insights into these potential business and financial impacts. These form an important input to our strategic planning process.\n\nIn summary, the radical and disruptive system-wide transformation we could face in the journey to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, would present a significant range of material risks, where regulatory and economic risks would be the most disruptive. However, many opportunities would also emerge, which we would be well placed to seize given our ambitious commitments are aligned with a proactive route towards net zero by 2039.\n\nThere is still much to do to advance our understanding of the risk and opportunities facing our business and our industry, and our strategic responses to such a radically different future. This analysis represents an important step to continue to engage and challenge our business and our stakeholders to define how we can make sustainable living commonplace.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nOur CTAP includes key metrics and targets to assess and manage climate risks and opportunities across our value chain. Two of the targets have been recognised as science-based by the Science Based Targets initiative - see page 55 for more details. The table below provides a high-level overview of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions.

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy disclosures\n\nNew legislation has been introduced this year to support the transition to a more sustainable economy and will continue to be augmented and amended. This includes the European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation which incorporates new reporting obligations including the EU Taxonomy. The Taxonomy sets out certain economic activities which are deemed to be environmentally sustainable - referred to as 'eligible activities'. It requires European businesses to disclose certain information about these eligible activities.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is work in progress and in creating the current list of eligible activities the European Commission have not yet considered our industry, focusing instead on those industries where they believe there is most potential for climate change mitigation or adaptation. However, certain European companies are required to report against the current list of eligible activities for this year end. On the basis of the current eligible activity list and in accordance with the legislation, we have undertaken a review of the Group's turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure (as defined by the EU Taxonomy) to identify the extent of any eligible activities within our business.\n\n## Turnover\n\n- \u25aa None of our turnover as detailed in our consolidated income statement (page 114) for the year ended 31 December 2021 is derived from eligible activities.\n\n## Capital expenditure (intangible assets and property, plant and equipment)\n\n- \u25aa 1% of our capital expenditure as detailed in our consolidated financial statements (pages 114 to 117) for the year ended 31 December 2021 is in respect of eligible activities. The activities identified are related to: (i) Construction and real estate; (ii) Water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation; and (iii) Energy.\n\n## Operating expenditure\n\n- \u25aa Operating expenditure as per the EU Taxonomy is defined as directly incurred, non-capitalised costs relating to research and development, building renovations, short-term leases and the repair and maintenance of property, plant and equipment. 0% of our operating expenditure for the year ended 31 December 2021 is in respect of eligible activities.\n\n## WEF/IBC metrics\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) and the International Business Council (IBC) have defined a number of metrics and disclosures to help standardise environmental, social and governance reporting. Our Annual Report and Accounts includes a number of the 'core' WEF/IBC metrics and disclosures, including: Governing purpose (pages 8 to 9 and 72 to 73), Ethical behaviour (page 19), Risk and opportunity oversight (pages 44 to 46), Climate change (pages 51 to 62), and Employment and wealth generation (pages 112, 121 to 130, 163). Further information on core metrics will be available on our website in May.\n\nSee our website for more information on reporting standards",

PLC's shares are traded through its listings on the London Stock Exchange and Euronext in Amsterdam, with its securities also traded on the New York Stock Exchange under its American Depositary Share programme.\n\nThe Board of PLC has implemented standards of corporate governance and disclosure policies applicable to a UK incorporated company, with listings in London, Amsterdam and New York.\n\n## Articles of association\n\nThe current Articles of Association (Articles) were approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM and adopted with effect from 5 May 2021. The amendments made to the Articles at the 2021 AGM brought the Articles up to date in a number of areas, including providing the ability to hold AGMs and general meetings in a hybrid format, meaning a combined physical and electronic general meeting enabling shareholders to choose whether they attend and vote in person or remotely through an electronic platform. PLC also retains the ability to hold AGMs and general meetings in the traditional way as a physical meeting without attendance via an electronic platform. No decision has been taken on how best to hold AGMs or general meetings in the future, but the Directors of PLC believe that it is important to have flexibility to hold AGMs or general meetings in a different format, which is what the changes to the Articles achieved. There were also a number of other changes to the Articles to reflect changes to company law and market practice.\n\n## Lapse of distributions\n\nAny PLC dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date of the declaration of the dividend by PLC reverts to PLC. Any unclaimed dividends may be invested or otherwise applied for the benefit of PLC while they are unclaimed. PLC may also cease to send any cheque for any dividend on any shares normally paid in that manner if the cheques in respect of at least two consecutive dividends have been returned to PLC or remain uncashed.\n\nUnilever N.V., the former parent company of the Unilever Group alongside PLC, was merged in to PLC and dissolved in November 2020 (Unification). The time periods for the right to claim cash dividends or the proceeds of share distributions declared by Unilever N.V. before Unification will remain at 5 and 20 years, respectively, after the first day the dividend or share distribution was obtainable from Unilever N.V. Any such unclaimed amounts will revert to Unilever PLC after the expiry of these time periods.\n\n## Redemption provisions and capital call\n\nOutstanding PLC ordinary shares cannot be redeemed. PLC may make capital calls on money unpaid on shares and not payable on a fixed date. PLC has only fully paid shares in issue.\n\n## Modification of rights\n\nModifications to PLC's Articles of Association must be approved by a general meeting of shareholders.\n\nModifications that prejudicially affect the rights and privileges of a class of PLC shareholders require the written consent of three-quarters of the affected holders (excluding treasury shares) or a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the class at which at least two persons holding or representing at least one-third of the paid-up capital (excluding treasury shares) must be present. Every shareholder is entitled to one vote per share held on a poll and may demand a poll vote. At any adjourned general meeting, present affected class holders may establish a quorum.\n\n## Indemnification\n\nThe power to indemnify PLC Directors, together with former Directors, the Company Secretary and the directors of subsidiary companies, is provided for in PLC's Articles of Association and deeds of indemnity have been agreed with all PLC Directors. Third-party directors' and officers' liability insurance was in place for such individuals throughout 2021 and is currently in force.\n\nIn addition, PLC provides indemnities (including, where applicable, a qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision) to the Directors of three subsidiaries, each of which acts or acted as trustee of a Unilever UK pension fund. Appropriate trustee liability insurance is also in place.\n\n## The Governance of Unilever\n\nA comprehensive description of Unilever's corporate governance arrangements, including further details on the structure of the Unilever Group, is set out in 'The Governance of Unilever'. It further details the roles and responsibilities of the Chair, Senior Independent Director (SID), CEO, CFO and other corporate officers and how our Board effectively operates, governs itself and delegates its authorities.\n\nThe Governance of Unilever also describes Directors' appointment, tenure, induction and training, Directors' ability to seek independent advice at Unilever's expense and details about Board and Management Committees (including the Disclosure Committee). Unilever's strong governance makes it well-placed to meet its strategic targets by ensuring it has effective risk management and internal controls, a diverse board, and high levels of engagement with stakeholders.\n\nwww.unilever.com/board-and-management-committees\n\n## Board\n\nThe Board of PLC has ultimate responsibility for the management, general affairs, direction, culture, performance and long-term success of our business as a whole. The Directors lead by example, promoting Unilever's culture and acting with integrity. The majority of the Directors are independent Non-Executive Directors who essentially have a supervisory role, providing constructive challenges, strategic guidance and specialist advice. In the normal course, Unilever has two Executive Directors, the CEO and the CFO. A list of our current Directors can be found on pages 72 to 73.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has established four Board Committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Responsibility Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The terms of reference of these Committees can be found on our website and the reports of each Committee, including attendance at meetings in 2021, can be found on pages 73 and 78 to 104.\n\nwww.unilever.com/boardsofunilever\n\n## Board meetings\n\nIn the ordinary course, six Board meetings are planned throughout the calendar year to consider important corporate events and actions, for example, the half-year and full-year results announcements; the development and approval of our strategy; oversight of the performance of the business; review of the risk framework; authorisation of major transactions; declaration of dividends; review of the financial plan; succession planning; review of the functioning of the Board and its Committees; culture; workforce engagement; and review of corporate responsibility. Other ad hoc Board meetings are convened to discuss strategic, transactional and governance matters that arise. A majority of Board meetings are held in the UK.\n\nIn 2021, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Board met physically in October and November only and these Board meetings took place in the UK. The Board held all other meetings in 2021 virtually, these being in February, March, May, June, July and September.\n\nThe Chair leads the Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the Unilever Group. The Chair sets the Board's agenda, ensures the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information, promotes and facilitates constructive relationships and effective contribution of all the Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and promotes a culture of openness and debate. The Group Secretary supports the Board to ensure that it has the policies, processes, information, time and resources it needs to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nWhen there is a Board meeting, the Non-Executive Directors usually meet also as a group, without the Executive Directors present. In 2021 they met six times. The Chair, or in his absence the SID, chairs such meetings.\n\nThe table showing the attendance of current Directors at Board meetings in 2021 can be found on page 73. If Directors are unable to attend a Board meeting, they have the opportunity beforehand to discuss any agenda items with the Chair.",

        "page_content": "## Board evaluation\n\nEach year the Board formally assesses its own performance, including with respect to its composition, diversity and how effectively its members work together, with the aim of helping to improve the effectiveness of both the Board and the Committees. At least once every three years, an independent third party facilitates the evaluation. The last external evaluation was performed at the end of 2019 by No.4, an independent third party consultant, and consisted of individual interviews with the Directors followed by a Board discussion in January 2020, covering both the outcome of the evaluation and the proposed actions to enhance the effectiveness of the Board.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Board performed an internal evaluation which consisted of the Directors completing a questionnaire that focused on a number of key areas including strategy, risk/financial controls, Board effectiveness, virtual ways of working, and information/knowledge. The Chair's statement on pages 4 to 5 describes the key actions agreed by the Board following the internal evaluation.\n\nThe evaluation of the performance of the Chair and CEO is led by the SID and Chair respectively, and bespoke questionnaires are used to support these evaluations.\n\nCommittees of the Board evaluate themselves annually under supervision of their respective Chairs taking into account the views of respective Committee members and the Board. The key actions agreed by each Committee in the 2021 evaluations can be found in each Committee Report.\n\n## Board appointment\n\nThe report of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC) on pages 82 to 83 describes the work of the NCGC in Board appointments and recommendations for re-election. The procedure for the nomination and appointment of Directors is contained within the document entitled 'Appointment procedure for PLC Directors' which is available on our website. Directors may be appointed by a simple majority vote of shareholders at a general meeting, or on an interim basis by the Board (in which case they will offer themselves for reappointment at the next AGM).\n\nwww.unilever.com/boardsofunilever\n\n## Board induction and training\n\nAll new Directors participate in a comprehensive induction programme when they join the Board. The Chair ensures that ongoing training is provided for Directors by way of site visits, presentations and circulated updates at (and between) Board and Board Committee meetings. The training covers, among other things, Unilever's business, environmental, social, corporate governance, regulatory developments and investor relations matters. For example, in 2021 the Directors received presentations on our sustainability strategy, our people strategy, progress on our 5 Growth Fundamentals, and eCommerce.\n\n## Independence and conflicts\n\nIt is important that the Non-Executive Directors can be considered to be independent. Each year the Board conducts a thorough review of the Non-Executive Directors', and their related or connected persons', relevant relationships referencing the criteria set out in The Governance of Unilever which is derived from the relevant best practice guidelines in the UK and US. The Board currently considers all our Non-Executive Directors to be independent of Unilever for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nWe attach special importance to avoiding conflicts of interest between PLC and its Directors. The Board ensures that there are effective procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest by Board members. A Director must without delay report any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest to the Chair and to the other Directors, or, in case any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest of the Chair, to the SID and to the other Directors. The Director in question must provide all relevant information to the Board, so that the Board can decide whether a reported (potential) conflict of interest of a Director qualifies as a conflict of interest within the meaning of the relevant laws. A Director may not take part in the decisiontaking process of the Board in respect of any situation in which he or she has a conflict of interest. We consider the procedures that Unilever has put in place to deal with conflicts of interest operate effectively.\n\nUnilever recognises the benefit to the individual and the Unilever Group of senior executives acting as directors of other companies but, to ensure outside directorships of our Executive Directors do not involve an excessive commitment or conflict of interest, the number of outside directorships of listed companies is generally limited to one per Executive Director and approval is required from the Chair.\n\nUnilever, through the NCGC, assesses and monitors the structure of the Board including the other directorships held or proposed to be held by Non-Executive Directors. Unilever aims to have a Board with a diverse range of skills and capabilities and works to the principle that each Director shall have sufficient time available for the performance of his or her duties. Unilever considers that the other board responsibilities of its Non-Executive Directors, including those taken on during 2021, are fully consistent with these aims.\n\n## How the Board engages with employees\n\nAs in previous years, given Unilever's global footprint and scope of operations, the Board decided that the most effective way of organising its engagement with employees was to share the responsibility among all Non-Executive Directors as a collective point of contact. In 2021, Unilever published a Workforce Engagement Policy (further details can be found on our website) setting out our approach to workforce engagement, which is endorsed by the Board. A number of workforce engagement activities are provided for in the policy including face-to-face engagement sessions with Non-Executive Directors, engaging with employee representatives, townhall meetings, site visits, employee engagement surveys and Code of Business Principles reports. We believe that taking into account feedback from our workforce widens the diversity of our Board's views when making business decisions.\n\nAt the start of the year, the Board discussed the progress on workforce engagement in 2020 and endorsed the programme for 2021. The Board considered workforce engagement valuable, offering the ability to tap into and understand different aspects of Unilever globally and to hear from people at all organisational levels, including junior employees. The engagements gave the Non-Executive Directors the ability to be systematically closer to markets and other parts of the business.\n\nIn 2021, the continuing Covid-19 pandemic meant we were required to hold workforce engagement activities virtually. Non-Executive Directors attended 14 virtual workforce engagement events across a diverse range of the workforce. This method of engagement provided Non-Executive Directors with the opportunity to meet and hear directly from cohorts of employees at all levels, geographies and Divisions across the business and allowed for discussions covering a wide range of topics.\n\nNon-Executive Directors engaged with topics that are personal to the workforce including health and wellbeing, equity, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and incentives. Non-Executive Directors heard from employees on strategic initiatives during sessions dedicated to the Unilever Compass and sustainability, innovation, eCommerce, and a specific geography visit with employees in North Asia. Sessions were dedicated to ways of working with two sessions focused on the future of work initiatives hearing from employees on Unilever's alternative employment models and those upskilling their teams and colleagues in future-fit skills. New hybrid ways of working were discussed with employees who had returned to offices. Non-Executive Directors connected with factory workers across three sessions hearing from employees in factories in Indonesia, Nigeria and Hungary as well as employee representatives from Italy. Lastly, Non-Executive Directors engaged with employees in the cyber security team to hear about their activities in managing this topic.\n\nWe collaborated with the European Works Council (EWC) in a number of areas. An engagement session was held with the EWC to share Unilever's social commitments. We co-developed and hosted a future of work conference with the EWC, which was attended by a member of the ULE. The conference highlighted best practices, outlined future plans and committed to drive the future of work agenda across Europe through site visits and engagements. Throughout the year, we worked in a small group with the EWC focused on equity, diversity and inclusion, exploring opportunities to achieve a better gender balance in supply chain, for example, in relation to shift patterns and flexible working. In 2022, we intend to hold a joint conference with the EWC to promote the equity, diversity and inclusion agenda across Europe.\n\nPerspectives from the workforce were taken into consideration in decision-making. For example:\n\n- \u00b7 Employee engagement survey (UniVoice) results from 2020 showed a need to focus more on career development, so this was added to the HR priorities for 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance continued\n\n- \u00b7 In the health and wellbeing engagement session, attendees suggested providing more training in this area. Line managers have access to training sessions, webinars, supporting material, bereavement guidance, Covid mental health guidebook, policies, online training plans, and a team energy tool.\n- \u00b7 Our Senior Independent Director attended a town hall meeting in July 2021, which was an opportunity for all employees globally to engage with one of our Non-Executive Directors. Employees were able to ask questions and receive feedback on topics, such as gender diversity pipeline for the Board, hearing employee perspectives, growth opportunities, CEO pay ratio, living wage and gender pay equity.\n- \u00b7 In an engagement session on the Unilever Compass, employees were able to ask Non-Executive Directors to leverage their networks to help expand Unilever's ability to influence stakeholders on sustainability.\n- \u00b7 An engagement session on the U-work employment model (employees engaged on assignments) identified a need to further consider IT access and aspects of compensation based on stage of career. The Non-Executive Directors remain committed to ensuring employment rights continue for workers under the U-work model.\n- \u00b7 In a session focused on North Asia, employees asked for feedback from the Non-Executive Directors on the business in China. The NonExecutive Directors confirmed that demand and production in China are both powerful and important to Unilever. They also confirmed business focus on sustainability and local product solutions in China.\n- \u00b7 The Board believes that ensuring a culture that embraces differences without bias is key to stepping up diverse talent representation. This has been facilitated, for example, by inclusion workshops and catalyst conversations, starting with the ULE. The engagement activities in 2021 continue to be a success with positive feedback from employees and Non-Executive Directors alike. A survey of employees who attended found that 59% felt their session topic was extremely relevant to them, all felt they were given the opportunity to raise matters of interest to them and felt listened to, and all felt the sessions are an effective way for Unilever to engage with employees.\n\nNon-Executive Directors found the virtual sessions allowed for effective dialogue with a broad range of employees. Therefore, we intend to continue with virtual connects in 2022 to access hard-toreach sites and diverse Unilever communities.\n\nBased on feedback from Non-Executive Directors, we will also look to carry out some in-person engagement sessions in 2022, subject to any travel restrictions caused by Covid-19.\n\n## Board discussions and decision-making\n\nWithin our business model we have identified six stakeholder groups that are crucial to our ongoing success, see page 9. As part of our Section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 disclosure, below we detail how our Directors engaged with stakeholders and had regard to their interests when setting Unilever's strategy and taking decisions concerning the business. This, along with the information on page 63 which explains how we engaged with our stakeholders in 2021 and the information on pages 69 to 70 which explains how we engaged with our employees in 2021, form our Section 172 statement.\n\nWith clear roles and responsibilities defined by the Governance of Unilever, the Board and the ULE work in tandem to ensure the success of the business, informed by the individual knowledge and experience Board members bring. Board meetings, knowledge sessions covering Unilever Compass topics, visits and an agreed programme of engagement with employees ensure the Board and ULE can come to a rounded view of the interests of stakeholders when making strategic decisions. In 2021, the ten Board visits were held virtually due to Covid-19 and included sessions with a number of key markets as well as detailed discussions on Unilever's largest brands, Dove and Knorr.\n\nThe following section illustrates the key discussions and decisions of the Board in 2021, including highlighting how the Board considered the interests of stakeholders in the context of the strategic choices set out in the Unilever Compass.\n\n| Unilever Compass strategic choices                                          | Board discussions                                                                          | Stakeholders considered                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Develop our portfolio into high growth spaces                               | Our disposals and acquisitions: ekaterra and  Paula's Choice                               | Shareholders, our people, consumers,  customers, planet & society                                 |\n| Win with our brands as a force for good,  powered by purpose and innovation | Our approach to innovation and the Climate  Transition Action Plan (CTAP)                  | Shareholders, our people, consumers,  customers, suppliers & business partners,  planet & society |\n| Accelerate in USA, India, China and key  growth markets                     | Growth strategies in USA, India and China                                                  | Shareholders, our people, consumers,  customers, suppliers & business partners,  planet & society |\n| Lead in the channels of the future                                          | Accelerating eCommerce and becoming  the digital commerce partner of choice  for customers | Shareholders, our people, consumers,  customers                                                   |\n| Build a purpose-led, future-fit organisation  and growth culture            | Our strategy for equity, diversity and inclusion  (EDI)                                    | Shareholders, our people, consumers,  customers, suppliers & business partners,  planet & society |\n\n## Develop our portfolio into high growth spaces\n\nThe evolution of our portfolio into high growth spaces is an important part of our growth strategy. As one of the steps to deliver this strategy, the Board endorsed proposals to separate Unilever's global tea brands into a new entity, to place them into a new company called ekaterra and then to sell ekaterra via an agreement reached in 2021 (see page 15). The Board concluded that ekaterra's strong portfolio and positive momentum would enable it to prosper under new ownership, while the interests of Unilever would be served through a portfolio more focused on high-growth spaces.\n\nWe have also acquired new brands in pursuit of our strategy. Our most recent is Paula's Choice, a digitally-led cruelty-free brand (see page 15). The acquisition represents a strong addition to Beauty & Personal Care's Prestige beauty portfolio and supports Unilever's expansion into this fastgrowing market.\n\nIn June, the Board approved the acquisition of Paula's Choice, noting its potential for growth and the strength it would bring to the business in terms of its appeal to consumers, particularly those seeking cruelty-free options and transparency on ingredients. The company's long experience in digital commerce will also be invaluable as we pursue another of our strategic ambitions to become a leader in channels of the future.\n\n## Win with our brands as a force for good, powered by purpose and innovation\n\nWe rely on our world class R&D capability to evolve our portfolio and capitalise on high growth opportunities. We've developed a number of focused science and technology initiatives to position the business for the future - based on clear priorities and disciplined execution of bigger projects. A number of these focus on opportunities from the low carbon transition. Home Care's Clean Future strategy is already demonstrating the potential of our ambitious approach with high-performance renewable and recycled ingredients (see page 23). And through our Future Foods strategy we're developing lower carbon, plant-based foods alternatives (see page 22).\n\nOur comprehensive Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) sets out how through our business, our purpose-led brands and our value chain partners we will transition to net zero emissions by 2039 and zero emissions in our operations by 2030. Innovation will play a key role in achieving these goals. The Board approved the CTAP's creation in 2020 and supported our proactive stance in setting out this ambitious agenda, agreeing that it was a critical move for the long-term benefit of the business and society.",

        "page_content": "We published the CTAP in 2021, with reference to a number of climaterelated investor initiatives to ensure that it met investor expectations. The views of investors were canvassed by the Chair, CEO and CFO. Investors supported the publication of the CTAP, agreeing that it represented a wellconsidered approach to managing risk and opportunity.\n\nThe Board studied the cost assumptions underlying the CTAP and considered the long-term commercial gain from emissions reductions, noting that leveraging the power of Unilever's value chain will be essential to drive the scale and pace of the change required. They also emphasised that citizens and consumers have increasing expectations of company action on climate change. The Board concluded that the CTAP will prove valuable in the future, particularly plans to communicate the carbon footprint of products. These footprints - which will require in-depth GHG lifecycle analysis by our R&D teams - will ultimately help consumers make lower carbon choices.\n\nIn March 2021, the Board agreed that the CTAP should be put to a nonbinding advisory vote at the AGM in May, where it received overwhelming support with over 99% of votes in favour.\n\n## Accelerate in USA, India, China and key growth markets\n\nDuring the year the Board scrutinised progress against the Unilever Compass strategy. Underpinning the success of the Unilever Compass are the 5 Growth Fundamentals (see page 9) - which are being driven with discipline throughout Unilever to improve the operation of the business. In addition, they held in-depth discussions with our three biggest businesses - the USA, India and China - to analyse progress on growth in these important markets.\n\nIn discussions with the US leadership team, the Board noted that the USA represents a very competitive and volatile market. The US business is building its competitiveness, and growing the proportion of the business sold through eCommerce remains a priority. It is working closely with customers, for example by creating customised product ranges for them, while boosting its premium product portfolio. Ensuring its brands serve the varying needs of consumers, for example the Hispanic population, has also been identified as a priority.\n\nThe Board's discussion with our Indian business focused on the continued resilience of Hindustan Unilever during 2021 and the opportunities over the next decade as internet access increases and the Indian economy expands. Hindustan Unilever is pursuing growth in line with the Unilever Compass - with a particular focus on making good nutrition accessible and building our beauty brands. Recognising that these plans respond to consumer needs, the Board endorsed Hindustan Unilever's strategic growth ambitions.\n\nIn China, consumers' passion for digital commerce continues to rise. The Board spoke to the Unilever China leadership team and studied an example of how the Chinese business had benefited from improving its digital capabilities. By connecting real-time social media advertising to eCommerce sites, it was able to track the effectiveness of its advertising in converting to sales, and ultimately to derive a bigger return on its marketing investment. Integrating digital processes is a company-wide imperative to support growth, and Unilever has placed a high priority on training for employees, particularly for those in marketing (see page 19).\n\nFrom its workforce engagement discussions with employees (see page 69), the Board recognised the importance of localised products and solutions for Chinese consumers, and urged Unilever China to continue developing its portfolio of in-home foods, hygiene, and health and wellbeing brands.\n\n## Lead in the channels of the future\n\nOnline commerce continues to grow, a trend that accelerated as people switched to digital channels during the pandemic. The Board keeps close track of Unilever's strategic choice to lead in the channels of the future, which goes hand in hand with the strategic choice to accelerate growth in key markets.\n\nThe Board focused on eCommerce during its July meeting and Unilever's aim to become the digital commerce partner of choice for customers. To achieve this, we are developing our capabilities across business-tobusiness (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) channels. At the same time, we are exploring new business models and new routes to market in our aim to help customers - both large and small - grow their businesses.\n\nDigital commerce also featured prominently in the Board's virtual visit programme during the year as business leaders, from markets as disparate as Brazil to Benelux, explained its importance in winning in the marketplace. For example, the Board discussed how the Chinese business is investing in people to deliver on this fast-moving agenda: recruiting from a highly competitive market and equipping existing employees with specialist skillsets such as data science. This visit reinforced a discussion in the workforce engagement programme, where earlier in the year the Board had emphasised the vital role of the Chinese business in delivering Unilever's growth strategy.\n\nThe Board was pleased to see that Unilever's initiatives are paying off, with eCommerce growing by 44% to reach 13% of turnover in 2021. Board members considered that accelerating this momentum remains crucial to the future success of the business.\n\n## Build a purpose-led, future-fit organisation and growth culture\n\nThe Board reviewed Unilever's plans for a new organisational model during its annual strategy discussions in 2021. It noted that the objectives of the simplified model were to create a leaner and faster organisation that is better able to respond to a fast-changing and intensely competitive environment. Employee feedback had also echoed the need for greater speed and agility. Five new category-focused Business Groups will equip Unilever to be more responsive to consumer and channel trends as each Group will be accountable for its strategy, growth, and profit delivery.\n\nThrough its Compass goals, Unilever is driving equity, diversity and inclusion in its culture and workforce, through its brands, in its advertising and among its suppliers.\n\nThe Board considers that a bias-free culture is crucial if we are to benefit from the talent of a diverse workforce, a view that was reinforced through our workforce engagement where gender diversity and gender pay equity were raised by employees.\n\nThe CEO chairs Unilever's Global Diversity Board and the Board's Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) also regularly reviews the topic. The Committee welcomed Unilever's comprehensive strategy and supported Unilever's drive to maximise the use of tools and data-driven insights to inform decision-making, for example to ensure fairness in recruitment and appointments. To support this improved decision-making, we are using a mix of behavioural science and data to shed light on our senior leaders' hiring patterns.\n\nUnilever's equity, diversity and inclusion strategy focuses on four areas: gender; race and ethnicity; people with disabilities; and LGBTQI+ communities. The CRC probed the detail of this strategy, enabling it to see, for example, how we are determining a baseline on people with disabilities to inform our future steps and how we are equipping eight countries to support advocacy on human rights and freedom from discrimination. And through a Board knowledge session, our objective to increase the representation of women across the business was also discussed.\n\nFurther illustrations of this strategy in action were shared in many of the Board virtual visits, for instance Unilever's team in Brazil explained their targets to ensure equality of opportunity for Black and mixed-race people (who make up half of the Brazilian population) in leadership roles - so that leaders reflect the societies they live in and the consumers they serve. And at a brand level, the Board engaged with Dove's team who shared their work to challenge systemic race-based hair discrimination through The CROWN Act.",

The CEO is responsible to the Board in relation to the operational running of the Group and other powers delegated to him by the Board. The CEO can delegate any of his powers and discretions, and he does so delegate to members of the ULE (with power to sub-delegate).\n\nThe ULE is composed of the CEO, CFO and other senior executives who assist the CEO in the discharge of the powers delegated to the CEO by the Board. Members of the ULE report to the CEO, and the CEO supervises and determines the roles, activities and responsibilities of the ULE. While ULE members (other than the CEO and the CFO) are not part of the Board decision-making process, to provide the Board with deeper insights, ULE members often attend those parts of the Board meetings which relate to the operational running of the Group. The ULE currently consists of the CEO, CFO and those listed below. As announced on 25 January 2022, there will be some changes to the leadership team with effect from 1 April 2022. These are indicated below.\n\nFor Alan Jope and Graeme Pitkethly, see page 72 ULE as at December 31 2021 *For ULE changes and new appointments, see page 75\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conny Braams\n\nChief Digital & Marketing Officer\n\nNationality Dutch Age 56, Female Appointed to ULE January 2020 Joined Unilever 1990\n\nCurrent external appointments: Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum (Advisory Board member); Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University (Advisory Board member).\n\nPrevious Unilever posts include: Unilever Middle Europe (EVP); Unilever Benelux (Chair and EVP); Home Care Europe (EVP); Unilever Food Solutions Asia, Africa and Middle East (EVP); various Unilever marketing and general management roles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fabian Garcia*\n\nPresident, North America\n\nNationality American Age 62, Male Appointed to ULE January 2020 Joined Unilever 2019\n\nCurrent external appointments: Council of Foreign Relations in the US (member); Arrow Electronics (Board member).\n\nPrevious posts include: Revlon (President and CEO); Colgate Palmolive (COO; President of the Asia/Pacific Division, EVP Latin America); P&G (President of Asia Pacific, General Manager of Venezuela).\n\n## Reginaldo Ecclissato*\n\nChief Business Operations Officer\n\nNationality Brazilian Age 53, Male Appointed to ULE January 2022 (replacing Marc Engel) Joined Unilever 1991\n\nPrevious Unilever posts include: EVP for Mexico, Caribbean, and Central America; EVP Supply Chain for North America and Latin America; VP Supply Chain, Home Care for the Americas.\n\nCurrent external appointments: Tapestry Inc.

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance continued\n\n## Our shares\n\n## Share capital\n\nPLC's issued share capital on 31 December 2021 was made up of \u00a381,798,695 split into 2,629,243,772 ordinary shares of 3 1 / 9 p each and each carrying one vote. A total of 62,976,145 PLC ordinary shares were held in treasury as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Listings\n\nPLC has ordinary shares listed on the London Stock Exchange (ULVR), on Euronext Amsterdam (UNA) and, as American Depositary Receipts* (UL), on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n- * One American Depositary Receipt represents one PLC ordinary share with a nominal value of 3 1 / 9 p.\n\n## Share issues and purchase of shares\n\nAt the 2021 PLC AGM held on 5 May 2021, the PLC Directors were authorised to:\n\n- \u00b7 issue new shares, up to a maximum of \u00a327,212,500 nominal value (which at the time represented approximately 33% of PLC's issued ordinary share capital);\n- \u00b7 disapply pre-emption rights up to a maximum of \u00a34,086,711 nominal value (which at the time represented approximately 5% of PLC's issued ordinary share capital) for general corporate purposes and an additional 5% authority in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment; and\n- \u00b7 make market purchases of its ordinary shares, up to a maximum of 262,811,000 ordinary shares (which at the time represented just under 10% of PLC's issued ordinary share capital) and within the price limits prescribed in the resolution.\n\nPLC conducted a share buyback programme during 2021 with an aggregate market value of approximately \u20ac3 billion, pursuant to which PLC bought back 62,976,145 PLC ordinary shares of 3 1 / 9 p each in two tranches. The purpose of the share buyback programme was to reduce the capital of PLC and the total consideration paid for the repurchased shares (excluding transaction costs) was \u20ac2,999,999,879. The 62,976,145 PLC ordinary shares that have been repurchased were held in treasury as at 31 December 2021, representing 2.4% of PLC's issued share capital. Outside of this share buyback programme, no other company within the Unilever Group purchased any PLC ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares during 2021.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, the Directors were also authorised to reduce the share premium account of the Company by \u00a318,400,000,000. Immediately prior to Unification becoming effective, Unilever N.V. had distributable reserves of some \u20ac20.6bn (\u00a318.4bn at the prevailing exchange rate). Upon Unification becoming effective, these distributable reserves of Unilever N.V. could not be legally recognised as realised profits (or distributable reserves) of PLC. Accordingly, the purpose of the reduction in PLC's share premium account was effectively to reinstate the distributable reserves of Unilever N.V. prior to Unification in PLC's accounts, so that PLC's distributable reserves were equivalent to those available prior to Unification. The share premium account reduction was approved by the court and became effective on 15 June 2021.\n\n## Trust Office\n\nThe Trust Office of Unilever N.V. operated a depositary receipts system whereby shareholders in Unilever N.V. could alternatively have their shares held and managed by the Trust Office. Following Unification, the Trust Office was dissolved on 19 January 2022. The ordinary shares in PLC held by the Trust Office have been sold and the proceeds transferred into consignment (in consignatie) in the deposit fund (consignatiekas) at the Dutch Ministry of Finance.\n\n## Our shareholders\n\n## Significant shareholders of PLC\n\nAs far as Unilever is aware, the only holder of more than 3% of, or 3% of voting rights attributable to, PLC's ordinary share capital ('Disclosable Interests') on 31 December 2021, was BlackRock, Inc. with a shareholding of 8.3% and voting interest of 8.5%.\n\nAs far as Unilever is aware, no new Disclosable Interests have been notified to PLC between 1 January 2022 and 24 February 2022 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report). Between 1 January 2019 and 24 February 2022, (i) BlackRock, Inc., and (ii) the aggregated holdings of the trustees of the Leverhulme Trust and the Leverhulme Trade Charities Trust, have held more than 3% of, or 3% of voting rights attributable to, PLC's ordinary shares.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nWe value open and effective communication with our shareholders.\n\nThe CFO has lead responsibility for shareholder engagement, with the active involvement of the CEO and supported by the Investor Relations department.\n\nIn 2021, meetings were held with institutional shareholders based across the world. Members of the ULE and Investor Relations team also met a large number of investors at industry conferences. In October 2021, the Chair and the Chairs of the Board committees met with investors in order to further establish the relationship between the Directors and our largest investors and to cement the understanding on how the Board and its Committees operate. During this event, the Chair and Committee Chairs each presented before concluding with a Q&A session.\n\nThe Chair of the Compensation Committee also extensively engaged with and sought feedback from investors in relation to our new Directors' Remuneration Policy, which was renewed at the 2021 PLC AGM. Further details can be found on page 84 of the Directors' Remuneration Report. This new Policy was approved at the 2021 AGM with over 93% of votes in favour of the Policy.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Board is briefed on investor reactions to the Unilever Group's quarterly results announcements and on any issues raised by shareholders that are relevant to their responsibilities.\n\nWe maintain a frequent dialogue with our principal institutional shareholders and regularly collect feedback. Private shareholders are encouraged to give feedback via shareholder.services@unilever.com. Our shareholders are also welcome to raise any issues directly with the Chair or the SID, and the Chair, Executive Directors and Chairs of the Committees are also generally available to answer questions from the shareholders at the AGM each year. More information on shareholder engagement can be found on page 76.\n\nwww.unilever.com/investor-relations\n\n## General meetings\n\nAt the AGM, the Chair gives his thoughts on governance aspects of the preceding year and the CEO gives a detailed review of the performance of the Unilever Group over the last year. In the ordinary course, shareholders are encouraged to attend the meeting and to ask questions at or in advance of the meeting. Indeed, the question and answer session forms an important part of each meeting. The external auditors are welcomed to the AGM and are entitled to address the meeting on any part of the business of the meeting which concerns them as auditors.\n\nAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the UK government's restrictions on gatherings, the 2021 PLC AGM was held as a closed meeting and shareholders were unable to attend the meeting in person. However, recognising that the AGM also serves as a forum for shareholders to engage with Directors, following the conclusion of the PLC AGM, a live shareholder webcast was held on Unilever's corporate website with statements by the Chair and CEO. The Senior Independent Director and all Committee Chairs were also present and following the statements from the Chair and CEO, the questions submitted by shareholders prior to the webcast and received during the webcast were responded to.",

PLC shareholders holding in aggregate 5% of the issued PLC ordinary shares are able to convene a General Meeting of PLC.\n\nInformation on the 2022 PLC AGM can be found within the PLC AGM Notice which will be published in March 2022.\n\n## Required majorities\n\nResolutions are usually adopted at PLC General Meetings by an absolute majority of votes cast, unless there are other requirements under the applicable laws or PLC's Articles. For example, there are special requirements for resolutions relating to the alteration of the Articles of Association and the liquidation of PLC.\n\nA proposal to alter the Articles of PLC can be made either by the PLC Board or by requisition of shareholders in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. Unless expressly specified to the contrary in PLC's Articles, PLC's Articles may be amended by a special resolution. The Articles of PLC can be found on our website.\n\nwww.unilever.com/investor-relations/agm-and-corporate-governance/ our-corporate-governance\n\n## Right to hold and transfer shares\n\nUnilever's constitutional documents place no limitations on the right to hold or transfer PLC ordinary shares. There are no limitations on the right to hold or exercise voting rights on the ordinary shares of PLC imposed by English law.\n\n## Corporate governance compliance\n\nWe conduct our operations in accordance with internationally accepted principles of good governance and best practice, while ensuring compliance with the corporate governance requirements applicable in the countries in which we operate. Unilever is subject to corporate governance requirements (legislation, codes and/or standards) in the UK and the US and in this section, we report on our compliance against these.\n\n## The United Kingdom\n\nIn 2021, PLC has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Further information on how Unilever has applied the five overarching categories of Principles can be found on the following pages - (i) Board Leadership and Company Purpose: pages 8 and 68 to 71; (ii) Division of Responsibilities: pages 68 to 69 and 78 to 83; (iii) Composition, Succession and Evaluation: pages 82 and 83; (iv) Audit, Risk and Internal Control: pages 78 to 79; and (v) Remuneration: pages 84 to 104. The UK Code is available on the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) website.\n\nRisk Management and Control: Our approach to risk management and systems of internal control is in line with the recommendations in the FRC's revised guidance 'Risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting' (the Risk Guidance). It is Unilever's practice to review acquired companies' governance procedures and to align them to the Unilever Group's governance procedures as soon as is practicable.\n\nUnder the UK Companies Act 2006 and rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Unilever is required to provide information on contracts and other arrangements essential or material to the business of the Unilever Group. We believe we do not have any such contracts or arrangements.\n\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: Information on GHG emissions can be found on pages 55 and 64.\n\nEmployee Involvement and Communication: Unilever's UK companies maintain formal processes to inform, consult and involve employees and their representatives. A National Consultative Forum comprising employees and management representatives from key locations meets regularly to discuss issues relating to Unilever sites in the UK. We recognise collective bargaining on a number of sites and engage with employees via the Sourcing Unit Forum, which includes national officer representation from the three recognised trade unions. A European Works Council, embracing employee and management representatives from countries within Europe, has been in existence for several years and provides a forum for discussing issues that extend across national boundaries. Further details on how the Board has engaged with the workforce can be found on pages 69 and 70.\n\nEqual Opportunities and Diversity: Consistent with our Code of Business Principles, Unilever aims to ensure that applications for employment from everyone are given full and fair consideration and that everyone is given access to training, development and career opportunities. Every effort is made to reskill and support employees who become disabled while working within the Group.\n\n## The United States\n\nPLC is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As such, PLC must comply with the requirements of US legislation, regulations enacted under US securities laws and the Listing Standards of the NYSE, that are applicable to foreign private issuers, copies of which are available on their websites.\n\nWe are substantially compliant with the Listing Standards of the NYSE applicable to foreign private issuers except as set out below.\n\nWe are required to disclose any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those typically followed by US companies listed on the NYSE. Our corporate governance practices are primarily based on the requirements of the UK Listing Rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code but substantially conform to those required of US companies listed on the NYSE. The only significant way in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by domestic companies under Section 303A Corporate Governance Standards of the NYSE is that the NYSE rules require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions thereto, with certain limited exemptions. The UK Listing Rules require shareholder approval of equity compensation plans only if new or treasury shares are issued for the purpose of satisfying obligations under the plan or if the plan is a long-term incentive plan in which a director may participate. Amendments to plans approved by shareholders generally only require approval if they are to the advantage of the plan participants.\n\nAttention is drawn to the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 78 to 79. In addition, further details about our corporate governance are provided in the document entitled 'The Governance of Unilever' which can be found on our website.\n\nAll senior executives and senior financial officers have declared their understanding of and compliance with Unilever's Code of Business Principles and the related Code Policies. No waiver from any provision of the Code of Business Principles or Code Policies was granted in 2021 to any of the persons falling within the scope of the SEC requirements. The Code of Business Principles and related Code Policies are published on our website.\n\nRisk Management and Control: Following a review by the Disclosure Committee, Audit Committee and Board, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the design and operation of the Unilever Group's disclosure controls and procedures, including those defined in the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 - Rule 13a - 15(e), as at 31 December 2021were effective.\n\nUnilever is required by Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. This requirement is reported on within the section entitled 'Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting' on page 197.\n\nwww.unilever.com/corporategovernance",

Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number eligible to be attended.\n\nThe Audit Committee is comprised only of independent Non-Executive Directors with a minimum requirement of three such members. It is chaired by John Rishton and the other current members are Judith Hartmann, Susan Kilsby and Adrian Hennah. Adrian joined the Board and the Audit Committee on 1 November 2021. For the purposes of the US SarbanesOxley Act of 2002, John Rishton is the Audit Committee's financial expert.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the members of the Audit Committee are competent in financial matters and have recent and relevant experience. Other attendees at Committee meetings were the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Auditor, EVP Financial Control and Risk Management, Chief Legal Officer, Group Secretary, EVP Sustainable Business Performance and Reporting and the external auditors. Throughout the year, the Committee members periodically met without others present and also held separate private sessions with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Auditor and the external auditors, allowing the Committee to discuss issues in more detail.\n\nThe majority of the meetings have been held virtually, while the last meeting in the year was held as a hybrid meeting adopting similar ways of working as the rest of the business.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in written terms of reference which are reviewed annually by the Committee, taking into account relevant legislation and recommended good practice. The terms of reference are contained within 'The Governance of Unilever' which is available on our website at\n\nwww.unilever.com/investors/corporate-governance\n\nThe Committee's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following matters:\n\n- \u25aa oversight of the integrity of Unilever's financial statements;\n- \u25aa review of Unilever's half-yearly and annual financial statements (including clarity and completeness of disclosure) and approval of the quarterly trading statements for quarter 1 and quarter 3;\n- \u25aa oversight of risk management and internal control arrangements;\n- \u25aa oversight of the external auditors' performance, objectivity, qualifications and independence; the approval process of non-audit services; recommendation to the Board of the nomination of the external auditors for shareholder approval; and approval of their fees, refer to note 25 on page 165; and\n- \u25aa oversight of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n- \u25aa performance of the internal audit function.\n\nAll relevant matters arising are brought to the attention of the Board.\n\nIn order to help the Committee meet its oversight responsibilities, each year management organise knowledge sessions for the Committee on subject areas within its remit. In 2021, sessions were held with management on cyber security, data privacy, major transformation projects and the management of third parties, particularly service providers and the increased dependency on those. The Committee also had presentations from management and discussions on the business's risk management activities, the preparation of the financial statements, the overall control environment, and the operation of the financial reporting controls.\n\n## How the Committee has discharged its responsibilities\n\nDuring the year, the Committee's principal activities were as follows:\n\n## Financial Statements\n\nThe Committee reviewed prior to publication the quarterly financial press releases together with the associated internal quarterly reports from the Chief Financial Officer and the Disclosure Committee and, with respect to the full-year results, the external auditor's report. It also reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts and the Annual Report on Form 20-F 2021. These reviews incorporated the accounting policies and significant judgements and estimates underpinning the financial statements as disclosed within note 1 on pages 118 to 119. Particular attention was paid to the following significant matters in relation to the financial statements:\n\n- \u25aa indirect tax provisions and contingent liabilities, refer to notes 19 and 20 on pages 159 to 161;\n- \u25aa revenue recognition - including discounts and incentives;\n- \u25aa accounting treatment of assets held for sale (e.g. ekaterra).\n\nThese matters were also highlighted by our external auditors as being important in their audit.\n\nFor each of the above areas, the Committee considered the key facts and judgements outlined by management. Members of management attended the section of the meeting of the Committee where their item was discussed to answer any questions or challenges posed by the Committee. The matters were also discussed with the external auditors and further information can be found on pages 107 to 113. The Committee specifically discussed with the external auditor how management's judgement and assertions were challenged and how professional scepticism was demonstrated during their audit of these areas; this included the disclosures for each matter noted above. The Committee is satisfied that there are relevant accounting policies in place in relation to these significant matters and management have correctly applied these policies.\n\nIn addition to the matters noted above, our external auditors, as required by auditing standards, also consider the risk of management override of controls. Nothing has come to our attention or their attention to suggest any material misstatement with respect to suspected or actual fraud relating to management override of controls.\n\nAt the request of the Board, the Committee undertook to:\n\n- \u25aa review the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual and half-yearly financial statements;\n- \u25aa assess whether the business was viable in accordance with the requirement of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The assessment included a review of the principal and emerging risks facing Unilever, their potential impact, how they were being managed, together with a discussion as to the appropriate period for the assessment. The Committee recommended to the Board that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the threeyear period (consistent with the period of the strategic plan) of the assessment; and\n- \u25aa consider whether the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 was fair, balanced and understandable, and whether it provided the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group's year-end position and performance, business model and strategy. To make this assessment, the committee received copies of the annual report and financial statements to review during the drafting process to ensure that the key messages being followed in the annual report were aligned with the company's position, performance and strategy. The Committee also reviewed the processes and controls that are the basis for its preparation. The Committee was satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## Risk management and internal control arrangements\n\nThe Committee reviewed Unilever's overall approach to risk management and control, and its processes, outcomes and disclosure. The assessment was undertaken through a review of:\n\n- \u25aa the yearly report detailing the risk identification and assessment process, together with any emerging risks identified by management;\n- \u25aa reports from senior management on those 2021 corporate risks for",

        "page_content": "which the Audit Committee had oversight responsibility: treasury, tax and pensions, information security, legal and regulatory compliance, and business transformation;\n\n- \u25aa the proposed 2022 corporate risks identified by the ULE;\n- \u25aa the Quarterly Risk and Control Status Reports, including Code of Business Principles cases relating to frauds and financial crimes;\n- \u25aa a summary of control deficiencies identified through controls testing activities together with action plans to address underlying causes;\n- \u25aa management's improvements to reporting through further automation and centralisation; and\n- \u25aa the annual financial plan and Unilever's dividend policy and dividend proposals.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the application of the requirements under Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nIn fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to risk management and internal control, the Committee met regularly with senior members of management and is satisfied with the key judgements taken.\n\nThe Committee has completed its review for 2021 on both risk management and internal control and was satisfied that the process had worked effectively and where specific areas for improvement were identified, there was adequate mitigation or alternative controls and that processes were under way to ensure sustainable improvements. The key area of focus has been to ensure that the controls impacted by the transformation programmes are appropriately designed and are being implemented effectively. Through its review, it also ensured that appropriate procedures are in place for the detection and prevention of fraud.\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee continued to review the sustainability assurance provided by PwC and plan for the assurance on non-financial Compass metrics going forward.\n\nThe Committee is monitoring and taking a proactive approach in anticipating and preparing for legislative or regulatory changes which may be required following the outcome of the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) consultation paper. As part of this, the Committee reviewed the formal response of the company into the BEIS consultation process mid-year 2021.\n\n## Internal audit function\n\nThe Committee reviewed internal audit's plan for the year which is focused on Unilever's corporate risks, and ensured the necessary resources are in place to perform effectively. The pandemic has impacted the way the audits have been completed since April 2020. The audits were mainly conducted remotely and there has been more focus on data analysis and the use of remote video technology. Data and analytics has made the internal audits more efficient and effective, increasing the coverage. The Committee reviewed interim and year-end summary reports and management's response together with the completion status of agreed actions.\n\nEvery five years, the Committee engages an independent third party to perform an effectiveness review of the function. This was last completed in 2018 and is planned for 2022. In 2021, the Committee evaluated the performance of the internal audit function through a questionnaire. The feedback was reviewed, and the Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness of the internal audit function. During the year, the Committee also met independently with the Chief Auditor and discussed the results of the audits performed and any additional insights obtained from the Chief Auditor.\n\n## Audit of the annual accounts\n\nKPMG, Unilever's external auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, reported in depth to the Committee on the scope and outcome of the annual audit, including their audit of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Their reports included audit and accounting matters, governance and control, and accounting developments.\n\nThe Committee held independent meetings with the external auditors during the year and reviewed, agreed, discussed, and challenged their audit plan, including the materiality applied, scope and assessment of the financial reporting risk profile of the Group.\n\nThe Committee discussed the views and conclusions of KPMG regarding management's treatment of significant transactions and areas of judgement during the year. The Committee considered these and is satisfied with the treatment in the financial statements.\n\n## External auditors\n\nKPMG have been the Group's auditors since 2014 and shareholders approved their reappointment as the Group's external auditors at the\n\n2021 AGM. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Directors will be proposing the reappointment of KPMG at the AGM in May 2022.\n\nThe Committee confirms that the Group is in compliance with The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which requires Unilever to tender the audit every ten years. The last tender for the audit of the Annual Report and Accounts was performed in 2013 with respect to the audit for the financial year 2014. The Committee has commenced planning for a tender process during 2022 with respect to the audit for the financial year 2024. This would allow time for the transition of non-audit services ahead of any change in auditor that may be made. At present, we are satisfied with the effectiveness of our current auditors and hence have no plans to retender the external auditor appointment for an earlier period. This position is re-evaluated each year.\n\nBoth Unilever and KPMG have safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the external auditors' objectivity and independence could be compromised, such as audit partner rotation and the restriction on nonaudit services that the external auditors can perform as described below. KPMG has issued a formal letter to the Committee outlining the general procedures to safeguard independence and objectivity, disclosing the relationship with the Company and confirming their audit independence. During 2021, as part of routine partner rotation, Jonathan Mills of KPMG replaced Nicholas Frost as lead audit partner.\n\nEach year, the Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external audit process which includes discussing feedback from the members of the Committee and stakeholders at all levels across Unilever. Interviews are also held with key senior management within both Unilever and KPMG. During the year, KPMG presented to the Committee the key findings from the review of their 2019 audit files by the FRC's Audit Quality Review (AQR) team. KPMG confirmed that they had acknowledged the AQR comments and had addressed all of them in the 2020 audit through a combination of additional procedures and improved documentation.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the statutory audit, other audit and non-audit services provided by KPMG and compliance with Unilever's documented approach, which prescribes in detail the types of engagements, listed below, for which the external auditors can be used:\n\n- \u25aa statutory audit services, including audit of subsidiaries;\n- \u25aa other audit services - audits that are not required by law or regulation; and\n- \u25aa non-audit services - work that our external auditors are best placed to undertake, which may include:\n- \u25aa services required by law or regulation to be performed by the audit firm; and\n- \u25aa services where knowledge obtained during the audit is relevant to the service such as bond issue comfort letters.\n\nUnilever has for many years maintained a policy which prescribes in detail the types of engagements for which the external auditors can be used with all other engagements being prohibited. The policy is aligned with both UK and SEC regulations and is updated in line with these regulations.\n\nAll engagements over \u20ac250,000 require specific advance approval by the Audit Committee Chair. The Committee further approve all engagements which have been authorised by the EVP Financial Control and Risk Management. These authorities are reviewed regularly and, where necessary, updated in the light of internal and external developments. Since the appointment of KPMG in 2014, the level of non-audit fees has been below 7% of the annual statutory audit fee. The level of other audit fees has been below 6% of the annual statutory audit fee except for 2017 (41%), 2018 (24%), 2020 (32%) and 2021 (21%) due to assurance work relating to the disposal of our Spreads business (2017 and 2018) and assurance work relating to the separation of our Tea business (2020 and 2021).\n\n## Evaluation of the Audit Committee\n\nAs part of the internal Board evaluation carried out in 2021, the Board evaluated the performance of the Committee. The Committee also carried out a self assessment. While overall the members concluded that the Committee is performing effectively, they agreed to ensure continued engagement with the Group's operations by organising (virtual) site visits and to allocate time to transformation projects.\n\n## John Rishton\n\nChair of the Audit Committee\n\nJudith Hartmann\n\nAdrian Hennah\n\nSusan Kilsby",

Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number eligible to be attended.\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee comprises three Non-Executive Directors: Strive Masiyiwa (Chair), Youngme Moon and Feike Sijbesma.\n\nThe Chief Supply Chain Officer, the Chief Sustainability Officer and the Chief Business Integrity Officer attend the Committee's meetings. The Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary may also join the Committee's discussions.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees Unilever's conduct as a responsible global business. Core to this remit is its governance of progress on Unilever's sustainability agenda, as set out in the company's integrated business strategy, the Unilever Compass (see pages 8 to 11). Core to this remit is reviewing sustainability-related risks, developments and opportunities.\n\nThe Committee is also charged with ensuring that Unilever's reputation is protected and enhanced, so it must consider the company's influence and impact on stakeholders. Central to this is the need to identify any external developments that are likely to have an influence on Unilever's standing in society, and to ensure that appropriate and effective communication policies are in place to support the company's reputation. This remit also extends to overseeing Unilever's Code of Business Principles and thirdparty compliance, ensuring that both Unilever's direct employees and those working within the company's value chain comply with the expected standards of conduct.\n\nThe Committee's discussions are informed by the experience of the Unilever Leadership Executive - as those accountable for driving responsible and sustainable growth through Unilever's operations, value chain and brands. Other senior leaders are invited to the Committee to share their perspectives and insights on key issues and external developments. These in-depth discussions ensure the Committee stays alert to current and emerging trends and any potential risks arising from sustainability issues. The Committee captures these insights for the Board through formal feedback and the ongoing sharing of knowledge.\n\nComplementing the Committee's role, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing significant breaches of the Code of Business Principles as part of its remit to review risk management and for overseeing the independent assurance programme of Unilever's sustainability commitments within the Unilever Compass.\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are set out at:\n\nwww.unilever.com/corporategovernance\n\nMeetings are held quarterly and ad hoc as required - four were held in 2021. The Committee Chair is responsible for reporting the findings from the meetings to the Board, thus ensuring that the Board can fulfil its oversight responsibilities.\n\nFollowing the Committee's terms of reference and Unilever's principal risks, in 2021 the Committee's agenda covered the new sustainability commitments of the Unilever Compass strategy and in addition the Code and third-party compliance, safety, plastic packaging, setting the new Sustainability Progress Index (SPI) KPIs aligned with the Unilever Compass, corporate reputation and litigation.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee also addressed a range of other strategic and current issues, including occupational health and human rights. How Unilever handled the Covid-19 pandemic remained topical.\n\n## How the Committee has discharged its responsibilities\n\nIn 2021, the Committee's principal activities were as follows:\n\n## Code of Business Principles\n\nThe Code and associated Code Policies set out the standards of conduct expected of all Unilever employees in their business endeavours. Compliance with these is an essential element in ensuring Unilever's continued business success and is identified as an ethical, legal and regulatory risk to Unilever (see page 50).\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for oversight of the Code and Code Policies, ensuring that they remain fit for purpose and are appropriately applied. It maintains close scrutiny of the mechanisms for implementing the Code and Code Policies. This is vital as compliance is essential to promote and protect Unilever's values and standards, and hence the good reputation of the Group.\n\nAt each meeting, the Committee reviews an analysis of investigations into non-compliance with the Code and Code Policies and discusses any trends arising from these investigations.\n\nThe Committee also considers litigation and regulatory matters which may have a reputational impact and reviews a summary of any significant developments at each meeting. These matters include environmental issues, anti-bribery and corruption and competition law compliance.\n\nIn 2021, human rights was a focus for the Committee's Code oversight. The Committee was updated on and discussed a summary of the legislation enacted and/or proposed in the UK, EU and US in relation to supply chain transparency and mandatory due diligence. This deep dive included the deforestation related proposals in all three jurisdictions, and the German and broader EU proposals on Corporate Sustainability Reporting, mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence and governance risks. Although it was acknowledged that much of the proposed legislation was still to be passed and uncertainties existed in the final requirements and related implications, it was concluded that Unilever is well placed to meet any new requirements through its commitment and work previously under Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan and currently, the Compass. A number of actions are underway to put Unilever in a position to comply with any new requirements including the establishment of a cross-functional workshop to define the implementation roadmap. The Committee also reviewed Unilever's Modern Slavery Statement and Human Rights Report, before the Statement was put to the Board and published.\n\nIt also reviewed the EU's Whistleblower Protection Directive, concluding that the impact on the company would be minimal given Unilever's already comprehensive standards in this area.\n\n## Principles and standards for third parties\n\nExtending Unilever's values to third parties is essential if Unilever is to generate responsible growth and a positive social impact on the industry.\n\nA lack of third-party compliance can pose a significant risk to the business, (see principal risks, page 50), so the Committee examines Unilever's compliance programmes in detail to ensure risks are minimised.\n\nAt each meeting, the Committee tracks compliance with Unilever's Responsible Sourcing Policy (RSP) for suppliers and its Responsible Business Partner Policy (RBPP) for customers and distributors. Together they set out Unilever's requirements that third parties conduct business with integrity and respect for human rights and core labour principles. In 2021, the Committee scrutinised Unilever's roll-out of the RSP First programme that ensures that no new supplier can be onboarded to Unilever's systems without first formally agreeing to the requirements of the RSP.\n\n## Safety and security\n\nThe need to keep people safe remained a priority in the face of Covid-19. Due to the pandemic, in 2021 mental health continued as a focus for the Committee's oversight of employee wellbeing.",

        "page_content": "Unilever's approach centred on ensuring business continuity and ensuring people were physically equipped and felt psychologically secure in the workplace or when working from home. Unilever has long-standing employee assistance programmes, which are accessible to all employees.\n\nIn 2021, programmes were expanded to include tools to help line managers to support team wellbeing, dedicated support for families of bereaved employees and the continuation of the Mental Health Champions Network. The Committee commended the newly created dashboard tracking Unilever's occupational health ambitions and the level of the company's attention on employee health and wellbeing.\n\nThe Committee has continued to receive an ongoing update of Unilever's Covid preparations and actions across its business and supply chain.\n\nThe Committee continued to review Unilever's safety standards and Unilever continues to protect people from accidents. Sadly three contractors and four employees lost their lives (see page 18), but the Total Recordable Frequency Rate (TRFR) improved.\n\nThe Committee also examined Unilever's approach to security. As a global business, Unilever operates in many countries, some of which suffer from a weak rule of law or from growing social and political unrest. Similarly, cyber threats continue to expand. The business continues to upgrade its resilience programmes to protect its people and assets.\n\n## Improving the health of the planet\n\nThe effects of climate change and nature loss are becoming ever more apparent and increasingly urgent. Following the launch of Unilever's new commitments on climate and nature in 2020 (see page 10), in May 2021 Unilever put its Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP, see pages 51 to 56) before shareholders and sought a non-binding advisory vote on our ambitious emissions reduction targets and our plans to reach them. The Corporate Responsibility Committee studied the plan ahead of its publication and presentation to the Board. The Committee reviewed and supported the company's CTAP which the Committee considered reflects Unilever's leadership on sustainability matters.\n\nPackaging waste and single-use plastic continued as high priorities for the business and society in 2021. Unilever's goals cover using more recycled and less virgin plastic, improving the recyclability of plastic and an industry-leading commitment to an absolute reduction in plastic (see page 29).\n\nMembers noted the progress made on Unilever's plastic goals with more recycled material, a step-up in plastic collection and processing, an increase in the proportion of the portfolio that is now technically recyclable and a framework for absolute plastic reduction projects and innovation. However, it was noted that the reduction of virgin plastics remains Unilever's biggest challenge, the CRC urged Unilever to continue its efforts.\n\n## Contributing to a fairer and more socially inclusive world\n\nIn January 2021, Unilever launched new social goals to complement its environmental goals, recognising the interdependence of people and planet. The new goals set out to contribute to a fairer and more socially inclusive world which leaves no one behind.\n\nAlongside its new social goals, Unilever has strengthened its focus on equity, diversity and inclusion in gender, race, people with disabilities and LGBTQI+ across the company's value chain (see pages 19 and 28). In 2021, the Committee in particular reviewed and welcomed the progress made with regards to improving equity, diversity and inclusion strategies in Unilever's own operations, such as workforce representation, inclusive recruitment and career progression policies. The Committee counselled Unilever to maintain its data-driven monitoring on the progress made.\n\n## Protecting and enhancing Unilever's reputation\n\nEnsuring its good reputation is vital to Unilever's ongoing success. As activism rises, commentary on issues such as deforestation for palm oil or animal testing can travel faster and wider than ever before, while social media continues to amplify and accelerate issues. In 2021, the Committee considered the impact of Unilever's brands engaging with activist citizens and consumers on these topics.\n\nAs the Committee charged with overseeing Unilever's reputation, members scrutinised Unilever's processes for managing issues. These processes are defined within a clear governance framework and have been enhanced with more sophisticated forecasting techniques, and tracking and measurement tools, to gauge likely future issues and extended training.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the impact on Unilever of the decision made by the independent Board of Ben & Jerry's about sales in the West Bank, which attracted media and political attention. The Committee noted that Unilever has a strong and long-standing commitment to its business in Israel, and has been clear that it does not support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement.\n\n## Performance Share Plan\n\nUnilever's Reward Framework includes the Performance Share Plan (PSP), a long-term incentive plan that is linked to financial performance, as well as performance against sustainability targets, defined in the Sustainability Progress Index (SPI).\n\nSPI was based on a selection of key performance indicators (KPIs) from our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) which ran until 2020, reflected in the PSP up to and including the 2021 award.\n\nIn 2021, Unilever introduced the Compass, which includes a series of sustainability commitments for the business, and as such, we have updated the SPI incentive performance measure to reflect the Compass from the 2022 PSP award onwards.\n\nThe role of the Committee in 2021 with regards to SPI was therefore twofold: 1) assessment of Unilever's 2020 SPI performance for 2021 reward, and 2) agreement of the new SPI targets based on the Unilever Compass.\n\nTo come to a view on Unilever's 2020 performance on its sustainability commitments, the Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee jointly evaluate performance against the SPI targets.\n\nThe SPI is a two-fold assessment that captures quantitative and qualitative elements. Firstly, the Committee considered the 2020 targets reported in the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts alongside performance evidenced in a number of sustainability ratings and indices. The second part of the assessment takes into account the overall sustainability performance across the strategic actions of the Unilever Compass strategy.\n\nFollowing an in-depth discussion of the SPI, the Corporate Responsibility Committee agreed a performance rating which was endorsed by the Compensation Committee. This joint assessment forms part of the Compensation Committee's overall recommendation on the SPI outcome (see pages 91 to 93 for the SPI outcome for the 2021 PSP award).\n\nIn addition to the performance assessment, the Committee, also jointly with the Compensation Committee, agreed a new set of KPI, which reflect the three overarching strategic actions under the Unilever Compass: to improve the health of the planet; improve people's health, confidence and wellbeing; and to contribute to a fairer, more socially inclusive world.\n\nThese three strategic actions are underpinned by eight key pillars, all of which are  represented in new SPI KPIs. Each of the eight equally weighted SPI KPIs has specific annual KPIs that are fixed for the next three years. These enable the meaningful evaluation of progress against the overarching mid- to long-term Unilever Compass target.\n\nSee page 88 for the SPI KPIs for the 2022 PSP award as agreed between the Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee.\n\n## Evaluation of the Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\nAs part of the internal Board evaluation carried out in 2021, the Board evaluated the performance of the Committee. The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2021 and concluded that it was working effectively.\n\n## Strive Masiyiwa\n\nChair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\nYoungme Moon\n\nFeike Sijbesma",

Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number eligible to be attended.\n\nThe Committee is comprised of three Non-Executive Directors and the Chair. In anticipation of Laura Cha's retirement at the 2022 AGM, Ruby Lu joined the Committee upon her appointment on 1 November 2021. The Group Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. Other attendees at Committee meetings in 2021 were the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief HR Officer.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is primarily responsible for periodically assessing the structure, size and composition of the Board; evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence, diversity and knowledge on the Board; ongoing succession planning (including the development of a diverse pipeline for succession); drawing up selection criteria and appointment procedures for Directors; reviewing the feedback in respect of the role and functioning of the Board Committees arising from Board and Board Committee evaluations; and periodically reviewing and assessing Unilever's practices and procedures in relation to workforce engagement. It also has oversight of all matters relating to corporate governance and brings any issues in this respect to the attention of the Board.\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are set out in 'The Governance of Unilever' which can be found on our website at:\n\nwww.unilever.com/corporategovernance\n\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed its own terms of reference to determine whether its responsibilities are properly described. The amended terms became effective on 1 January 2022.\n\nIn 2021 the Committee met four times. In November, the Committee considered the results of the Committee's annual self-evaluation for 2021 and its priorities for the year and used these to help create an annual plan for meetings for 2022.\n\n## Appointment and reappointment of Directors and ULE\n\n## Reappointment of Directors\n\nAll Directors (unless they are retiring) are nominated by the Board for re-election at the AGM each year on the recommendation of the Committee who, in deciding whether to recommend nomination of a Director, take into consideration the outcomes of the Chair's discussions with each Director on individual performance, the evaluation of the Board and its Committees, and the continued good performance of individual Directors. Non-Executive Directors normally serve for a period of up to nine years. The average tenure of the NonExecutive Directors who have retired from the Board over the past ten years has been seven years. The schedule the Committee uses for orderly succession planning of Non-Executive Directors can be found on our website at:\n\nwww.unilever.com/committees\n\nOn 18 February 2021, Vittorio Colao stepped down as a Director. The Committee proposed the reappointment of all other Directors and the Directors were appointed by shareholders by a simple majority vote at the 2021 AGM, bringing the then number of Non-Executive Directors from ten to nine.\n\nIn anticipation of the retirement of both Laura Cha and John Rishton at the 2022 AGM following the completion of their nine-year tenure, Adrian Hennah and Ruby Lu were appointed to the Board on 1 November 2021. The Committee also recommends to the Board candidates for election as Chair and Senior Independent Director. Following the 2021 AGM, Youngme Moon decided to step down from her role as Senior Independent Director due to other commitments. Andrea Jung was appointed by the Board to succeed Youngme as Senior Independent Director, and Youngme continues to serve as a Non-Executive Director.\n\nFollowing Vittorio Colao stepping down as a Director, Andrea Jung replaced Vittorio Colao as Chair of the Compensation Committee. All other Committee Chairs remained in place in 2021, with John Rishton as Chair of the Audit Committee, Strive Masiyiwa as Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee, and Nils Andersen as Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\n## Succession planning and Board changes\n\nIn consultation with the Committee, the Board reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of succession planning processes and the actual succession planning at Board level, including ensuring that succession plans are based on merit and objective criteria, and that they promote diversity.\n\nWhen recruiting, the Committee will take into account the profile of Unilever's Board of Directors set out in 'The Governance of Unilever' which is in line with the recommendations of applicable governance regulations and best practice. Pursuant to the profile, the Board should",

        "page_content": "comprise a majority of Non-Executive Directors who are independent of Unilever, free from any conflicts of interest and able to allocate sufficient time to carry out their responsibilities effectively. With respect to composition and capabilities, the Board should be in keeping with the size of Unilever, its strategy, portfolio, consumer base, culture, geographical spread and its status as a listed company and have sufficient understanding of the markets and business where Unilever is active in order to understand the key trends and developments relevant for Unilever. The objective pursued by the Board is to have a variety of nationality, race, gender, ethnicity, social background and relevant skills and expertise. It is important that the Board has sufficient global experience and outlook, and financial literacy. As discussed later in this report, Unilever currently has a diverse Board in terms of gender and nationality and, as can be seen from the subset of the mapping that this Committee has done of the current Non-Executive Directors' skills and capabilities on page 73, composition and capabilities are in line with our Board profile described above.\n\nAt each Committee meeting there is a standing agenda item to review the succession plan for the Board and discuss short and long-term action plans on succession. Through these discussions the Committee reflects on whether the plans need to be updated or whether new requirements for potential candidates need to be implemented, ensuring we continue to adapt our succession planning to the skills and experience required on the Board. Reflecting its role in respect of board succession planning, early in 2021, the Committee's priority was to identify new non-executive directors to succeed two of the longer-serving members of the board - Laura Cha and John Rishton. Candidates were sought in line with the skills, experience and diversity requirements of the Board, with particular focus on the technical and professional skills required to take on certain committee responsibilities and who would also enhance the strategic discussion in the boardroom. Due to the successful previous experience with Egon Zehnder and Russell Reynolds, both agencies were engaged to support the process and identify candidates, with the search process leading to the appointments of Adrian Hennah and Ruby Lu during 2021.\n\n## ULE succession planning and appointment\n\nIn consultation with the Committee, the Board reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of succession planning processes and the actual succession planning at ULE level, including ensuring that succession plans are based on merit and objective criteria, and that they promote diversity.\n\n## Board Diversity Policy\n\nUnilever has long understood the importance of diversity and inclusion within our workforce because of the wide range of consumers and other stakeholders we connect with globally. This goes right through our organisation, starting with the Board.\n\nUnilever's Board Diversity Policy, which is reviewed by the Committee each year, is reflected on our website at:\n\nwww.unilever.com/boardsofunilever\n\nThe Board believes that the composition and quality of the Board should be in keeping with the size and geographical spread of Unilever, its portfolio, culture and status as a listed company. A diverse Board with a range of views enhances decision-making which is beneficial to the company's long-term success and in the interests of Unilever's stakeholders. Thus, the Board believes that Unilever Directors must be selected using objective and merit-based criteria, including on the basis of wide-ranging experience, backgrounds, skills, knowledge and insight with a continuing emphasis on diversity of its members.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee also reviewed and considered relevant recommendations on diversity and remains pleased that 55% of our Non-Executive Directors and 46% of all Directors were women and that eight nationalities were represented on the Board. As regards ethnicity, in 2021 eight directors identified themselves as White, four Directors identified themselves as Asian and one Director identified himself as Black. Further details on our approach to diversity and inclusion as well as gender balance of our workforce can be found on pages 19 and 64.\n\n## Corporate governance developments\n\nThe Committee reviews relevant proposed legislation and changes to relevant corporate governance codes at least twice a year. It carefully considers whether and how the proposed laws/rules would impact upon Unilever and whether Unilever should participate in consultations on the proposed changes. For example, during 2021, new EU proposals for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and a UK White paper on audit and corporate governance reform, alongside stakeholder interests, corporate reporting and overboarding were discussed by the Committee.\n\n## Evaluation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nAs part of the Board evaluation carried out in 2021, the Board evaluated the performance of the Committee. The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own composition and performance in 2021. The Committee members concluded that the Committee is performing effectively.\n\n## Nils Andersen\n\nChair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nLaura Cha\n\nAndrea Jung\n\nRuby Lu\n\nFeike Sijbesma",

Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number each member was eligible to attend.\n\n## Letter from the Chair\n\n## Dear shareholders,\n\nAs the Committee Chair, I am pleased to present Unilever's Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) 2021. In the sections below, I set out the Committee's activities in 2021, including Unilever's business performance in 2021 and how it links to key remuneration outcomes for the year. I also reflect on the feedback we received on our new Directors' Remuneration Policy, which was approved at the May 2021 AGM (referred to as the Remuneration Policy).\n\n## Business performance and remuneration\n\n2021 was a year of volatility with continued impact from the Covid-19 pandemic and unprecedented global commodity inflation driven by supply constraints and demand spikes.\n\nIn this context, we delivered Underlying Sales Growth (USG) of +4.5%, above our par target of 3.5%, driven by strong pricing of +2.9% and volume growth of 1.6%. Our growth was competitive with 53% of our business gaining market share on a Moving Annual Total basis.\n\nThe severe mismatch between supply and demand resulted in a once in a two-decade spike in commodity and logistics cost inflation. Prices of core ingredients have risen significantly versus early 2020 levels; Brent Crude Oil +60%, Soyabean Oil +90% and Palm Oil +130%. We accelerated pricing action and stepped up savings, which helped to offset much of the inflation challenge. We delivered Underlying Operating Margin (UOM) of 18.4%; -10bps versus prior year, below the threshold range of -5bps. Overall, Underlying Operating Profit grew 2.9%.\n\nFree Cash Flow (FCF) (excluding taxes paid on disposals) delivery remained strong at \u20ac6.5 billion ahead of our par target of \u20ac6.3 billion.\n\nUnderlying Earnings per Share (EPS) grew by +5.5% at current rates and included +0.9% from the \u20ac3 billion share buy-back programme announced in April 2021.\n\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) was 17.2%, being sustained in the mid to high teens, and Unilever's sustainability performance measure for the long-term incentive plan, the Sustainability Progress Index (SPI), achieved a 125% outcome, as detailed on page 92.\n\n## Incentive outcomes and wider stakeholder considerations\n\n## 2021 Annual Bonus\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Committee decided neither to change the targets in response to volatile business conditions nor to exercise discretion on the formulaic outcome, which will set the global bonus pool for all eligible Unilever employees.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee confirmed a bonus of 81% of target opportunity for both the CEO Alan Jope (resulting in a bonus of 122% of fixed pay against a target of 150%), and the CFO Graeme Pitkethly (resulting in a bonus of 97% of fixed pay against a target of 120%), as detailed in the chart on page 90.\n\nUnder the Remuneration Policy, 50% of the net bonus award will be deferred in shares for three years.\n\n## 2018-2021 Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP)\n\nSimilarly, no discretion was applied to the MCIP vesting based on performance in 2021.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee confirmed the formulaic outcome for the 2018-2021 MCIP was 87% of target, which will be applied to all eligible Unilever employees. This outcome is detailed in the chart on page 91, and corresponds to a vesting of 44% of the maximum of 200% for our two Executive Directors.\n\n## Wider stakeholder considerations\n\nWhen considering the annual bonus and MCIP outcomes, the Committee carefully took into account the experiences of our wider stakeholders in order to ensure that outcomes were aligned.\n\nIn particular, our decision not to amend targets mid-year in light of significant inflationary conditions was taken to ensure that employees and Executive Directors are treated commensurately with the interests of our shareholders. The final outcomes of 81% of target for annual bonus and 87% of target for MCIP are below our expectations. However, the Committee believes these outcomes represent the performance delivered to shareholders in challenging trading circumstances.\n\n## Our Remuneration Policy for 2021\n\nWe are delighted the Remuneration Policy was approved at the May 2021 AGM with 93.51% votes in favour, which is available on our website.\n\nAs detailed in full in last year's DRR, the key changes to the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors were to:\n\n- \u25aa replace the former long-term incentive plan, MCIP, with a new Performance Share Plan (PSP) that is entirely separate from the annual bonus plan;\n- \u25aa replace the voluntary investment of bonus through MCIP with a mandatory deferral of 50% of the net annual bonus in shares for three years;\n- \u25aa set performance measures for the PSP that are strategically aligned with the business; and\n- \u25aa reduce the long-term performance period for the PSP from four to three years while maintaining a five-year period from award to release by increasing the retention period from one year to two years.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy is operating as intended and, following the high level of support, no material changes are proposed in relation to how we implement the Remuneration Policy in 2022.\n\nRemuneration arrangements are determined throughout Unilever based on the same principles as for the Board, as set out in the Remuneration Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Executive Director fixed pay increases\n\n## 2021 increases\n\nAs set out in last year's DRR, we did not conduct a fixed pay review for the Executive Directors in the first half of 2021, and we planned to undertake such a review in the second half of 2021. This review was conducted taking into account business performance, external circumstances and salary increases awarded to the wider workforce.\n\nThe Committee conducted a review of the CEO and CFO packages against external market data* in the second half of 2021, as planned, which shows the CEO is between lower quartile and median on a fixed pay and target total compensation basis and the CFO is between median and upper quartile on fixed pay and just below median on a target total compensation basis.\n\nThe Committee approved a 2021 fixed pay increase of 3.5% for both the CEO and the CFO, effective from 1 July 2021. This is in line with the average increase awarded to the wider Unilever workforce in 2020.\n\nGiven the fixed pay increases were delayed and took place mid-year, they also reduced the incentives for 2021 compared to if the increases were awarded at the start of the year: PSP grants in 2021 were based on previous salary levels; and annual bonus opportunities for 2021 were based on the actual salary received during the year.\n\n## 2022 increases\n\nThere will be no fixed pay review for the Executive Directors in the first half of 2022. Such a review will take place in the second half of 2022, with any potential changes based on performance, external circumstances and with any increase below the level applied for the wider workforce.\n\nIn line with the Remuneration Policy and subject to the performance and workforce alignment, the Committee will, over time, continue to review the CEO's fixed pay positioning and progress towards the market median benchmark.\n\n*Our benchmarking peer group consists of other global companies of a similar financial size and complexity to Unilever and is set out in full in the Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Engaging with shareholders\n\nIn 2020, the Committee engaged extensively with shareholders and major advisory bodies (including the Investment Association, ISS, Glass Lewis, Hermes and Eumedion) on the Remuneration Policy. In the runup to the 2021 AGM, we had further consultation with some of these shareholders and advisory bodies on the Remuneration Policy.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, I spoke with investors and advisory bodies in the autumn of 2021 on how the Remuneration Policy landed in the organisation and wider investor community. Through this engagement, shareholders and major advisory bodies requested to better understand the performance measure on competitiveness, which was introduced for 2021, and how SPI targets are calculated. We have shared additional information and explanation with shareholders, advisory bodies and on our website, including:\n\n## Competitiveness: % Business Winning Market Share (% Business Winning)\n\n- \u25aa Competitiveness, measured as % Business Winning, was introduced as a new measure for the PSP. Growing competitively ahead of our markets is a key strategic driver of long-term growth.\n- \u25aa % Business Winning incentivises all country/category cells (e.g. UK deodorant) to win share, not just the big cells, thus supporting broadbased competitive growth.\n- \u25aa There is an end-to-end governance framework in place consisting of a cross-function steering committee and regular updates to, and evaluation by, the Committee.\n\nSee the remuneration topics section of our website under investors, corporate governance and other governance information for more on Business Winning Market Share.\n\n## Sustainability Progress Index\n\n- \u25aa SPI has been an established feature of our long-term incentive (LTI) scheme since it was introduced in 2017, in recognition of our vision to be the global leader in sustainable business and the importance of sustainability KPIs in driving business performance. SPI was based on a selection of KPIs from our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) which ran until 2020, reflected in the PSP up to and including the 2021 award.\n- \u25aa In 2021, Unilever introduced the Compass, which includes a series of new sustainability commitments for the business, and as such, we have updated the SPI incentive performance measure to reflect the Compass from the 2022 PSP award onwards.\n- \u25aa Within the Unilever Compass strategy, we have three overarching strategic actions: to improve the health of the planet; to improve people's health and wellbeing; and to contribute to a fairer, more socially inclusive world.\n- \u25aa These three strategic actions are underpinned by eight key pillars, all of which are represented in new SPI KPIs. Each of the eight KPIs are equally weighted and have specific annual KPIs that are fixed for the next three years. These enable the meaningful evaluation of progress against the overarching mid- to long-term Unilever Compass KPI.\n- \u25aa The eight KPIs are agreed between the Unilever Board's Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) and the Committee. The CRC and the Committee work together to review a detailed quantitative and qualitative update on performance against each KPI. The CRC and the Committee also look at the overall sustainability performance across the strategic actions of the Unilever Compass strategy. This information together is used to make a recommendation on the performance outcome for each year in the range of 0-200% for the Committee to consider.\n- \u25aa Because performance against the SPI incentive performance measure is calculated after the performance year has ended, the previous year's SPI applies to the performance year for LTI. For example, the 2020 SPI KPIs (based on USLP) were used for the 2021 performance year for LTI whereas the 2021 SPI KPIs (based on the Unilever Compass strategy) will be used for the 2022 performance year for LTI.\n- \u25aa The SPI KPIs for the 2021 PSP award are set out on page 92 and the SPI KPIs for the 2022 PSP award are set out on page 88.\n\nSee the remuneration topics section of our website for a video explanation on SPI.\n\n## Non-Executive Director fees\n\nThere was no increase to Non-Executive Director fees in 2021. Following a review in 2021, the Committee decided to keep Non-Executive Director fees the same for 2022. The Committee will review the fees again in 2022.",

We continued these engagements in 2021, see page 69 for a summary of the discussions that took place.\n\nIn July 2021, I attended a virtual town hall meeting open to all employees globally. This was an opportunity for employees to ask me questions, including in relation to Unilever's approach to remuneration. I was able to share that the Board considers topics on pay, such as living wage and pay equity, because the Board understands the issue of income equality, how it is expressed in society and what corporations can do to address it.\n\nWe sought feedback from employees globally who were eligible for the new PSP and 71% of respondents answered positively that PSP offers a more valuable reward for them personally. In addition, 85% understood how their role can impact the long-term business performance measures that determine final PSP pay-out. Overall, the Committee is pleased to receive such positive feedback.\n\nOne of the Non-Executive Directors attended an engagement session with employees on the subject of compensation and benefits. Employees shared feedback on progression within pay bands, differentiation of annual bonus, benefits of PSP over MCIP and competitiveness of Unilever's pension schemes.\n\nSee the Board and management committees section of our website under investors and corporate governance for a copy of Unilever's workforce engagement policy introduced in 2021.\n\n## Implementation report\n\nThe annual report on remuneration in this report describes 2021 remuneration in detail as well as the planned implementation of the Remuneration Policy in 2022.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee and the entire Board, I thank all shareholders and their representatives for their constructive engagement in 2021. Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the DRR at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Andrea Jung\n\nChair of the Compensation Committee",

Awards normally vest after three years, to the extent performance conditions are achieved. The first PSP  award was made on 7 May 2021, vesting on 15 February 2024 (with a requirement to hold vested shares for a  further two-year retention period). \u25aa The normal maximum award for the CEO is 400% of fixed pay and for the CFO is 320% of fixed pay. At target, 50%  of maximum vests, equating to 200% and 160% of fixed pay respectively. |\n| Implementation in 2021                      | The PSP was implemented in line with the Remuneration Policy.

A retention period of two years applies from vesting.\n\nPSP awards (based on target performance) to be made on 11 March 2022 as follows:\n\n- \u25aa CEO 200% Fixed Pay: \u20ac3,121,560\n- \u25aa CFO 160% Fixed Pay: \u20ac1,881,150\n\nCumulative FCF from operating activities in current currency ensures sufficient cash is available to fund a range of strategic capital allocation choices.\n\nROIC measures the return generated on capital invested by the Group and is calculated as underlying operating profit after tax divided by the annual average of: goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, net assets held for sale, inventories, trade and other current receivables, and trade payables and other current liabilities. The target range of a threshold of 15% and maximum of 19% expresses our commitment to deliver ROIC at a level of mid to high teens, whilst continuing to reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and disposals.\n\nCompetitiveness measured by % Business Winning was introduced as a new metric for the PSP in 2021 and is explained in more detail in the Chair letter on page 85. % Business Winning will be assessed each year as the aggregate turnover of the portfolio components (country/category cells) gaining value market share as a % of the total turnover measured by market data. As such, it assesses what percentage of our revenue is being generated in areas where we are gaining market share. The outcome for the 2022-2024 PSP is the average of the three years % Business Winning performance. With intense competition and changing shopper trends, winning share in each portfolio or geography segment presents a challenge for all players; repeating these wins over successive years is even more demanding. At consolidated Group level delivering consistently in the range of 50% Business Winning will enable us to grow with our markets, delivering above 50% Business Winning over successive years supports our objective of growing ahead of our markets. Keeping this in mind, the Committee believes that a stretch goal of 60% and threshold performance of 45% resulting in a zero pay out for this performance measure to be appropriate.\n\n## SPI KPI setting under the Unilever Compass\n\nSPI is explained in the Committee Chair's letter on page 85. The eight SPI KPIs agreed between the CRC and Committee for 2022 PSP awards are as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Climate action: The total number of suppliers with whom we have signed agreements to develop renewable or recycled carbon surfactants (surface active agent).\n- \u25aa Protect and regenerate nature: % of volume of supply of palm oil, soy, paper and board, cocoa and tea purchased and/or contracted from low-risk sources.\n- \u25aa Waste-free world: Total tonnes of recycled plastic material content ('recycled plastic') used in our plastic packaging portfolio as a percentage of total tonnes of plastic packaging used in products sold.\n- \u25aa Health and wellbeing: Number of people reached by brand communications and initiatives that help improve health and wellbeing, and help advance equity and inclusion.\n- \u25aa Positive nutrition: Total sales (euros) of Unilever's products containing plant-based meat and dairy alternatives.\n- \u25aa Raise living standards: Value of contracts including the living wage requirement.\n- \u25aa Equity, diversity and inclusion: Monetary value (euros) of all invoices received from Tier 1 suppliers that are either verified as a diverse business by an approved certification body or have self-declared as a diverse business.\n- \u25aa Future of work: % of employees with a future-fit skills set.\n\nIn addition to the three elements mentioned above, our Executive Directors are provided with non-monetary benefits. These include medical insurance cover, actual tax return preparation costs and provision of death-in-service benefits and administration.",

These have been translated into euros using the exchange rate on the date of vesting (\u20ac1 = \u00a30.8379 and \u20ac1 = $1.1354).\n\nPerformance against targets:\n\nFurther details of the MCIP outcome are described in the Committee Chair's letter on page 84. Further detail on the SPI outcome is set out below. On the basis of this performance, the Committee determined that the MCIP awards at the end of 2021 will vest at 87% of initial target award levels (i.e. 44% of maximum for MCIP).\n\n## Outcome of SPI for MCIP cycle 2018-2021:\n\nAs explained in the Committee Chair's letter on page 85, the SPI is an assessment of the business's sustainability performance by the CRC and the Committee that captures quantitative and qualitative elements (see page 92). The CRC and the Committee agree on a SPI achievement level against the KPI taking into account performance across the entire SPI pillar.\n\nThe 2021 SPI performance (based on 2020 USLP performance) is set out below. The SPI index for the four-year MCIP performance period is calculated by taking a simple average and is set out at the bottom of the table for MCIP 2018-2021 (see page 92).\n\nThe USLP was our 10-year plan to make sustainable living commonplace by halving our environmental footprint and increasing our social impact through our brands, innovation, sourcing and operations.\n\nSince 2010, we helped 1.3 billion people improve their health, wellbeing and hygiene through programmes led by some of our biggest brands: Lifebuoy, Dove, Domestos, SMILE, Pepsodent and Vaseline. We enhanced the livelihoods of millions of people by driving fairness and human rights in our operations and extended supply chain. We achieved our commitment to pay every direct Unilever employee at or above a living wage.\n\nWe have made progress on our ambition to halve the environmental footprint of the making and use of our products. We have achieved a 75% reduction of CO 2 emissions from energy in our factories per tonne of production and decreased the waste per consumer by 34%. Through innovation, R&D expertise, and partnerships with suppliers, we are finding lower carbon solutions for our everyday products, which has resulted in good progress, particularly in Foods & Refreshment and Home Care where we have reduced emissions by 30% and 37% respectively since 2010.\n\nThrough our 'less plastic, better plastic, no plastic' framework, we have continued to progress against our waste-free world plastic packaging goals. We have scaled the use of recycled material in our packaging, achieving 16% of our packaging using recycled plastic or 112,000 tonnes across the portfolio. Our brands played a major part in increasing our use of recycled plastic. Dove and Sunlight for example, moving to 100% recycled material bottles in their biggest markets, and innovations in Foods & Refreshment using ice cream tubs made with food-grade recycled plastic in key markets in Europe.\n\nWe also continue in our journey to deforestation-free supply chains, where in 2020, we purchased and/or contracted 83% of volume of supply of palm oil, soy, and paper and board from low-risk sources.\n\nWe maintained our leading status by achieving top ratings in industry indexes and continue to use our scale and influence to drive wider changes on issues that are relevant to our business.\n\n2021 marks the final year of reporting against the USLP commitments. In 2022, the SPI indicators will be based on progress made against the Unilever Compass commitments (see page 88 for details).",

Incoming Executive Directors will be required to retain all shares vesting from any share awards made since their appointment (after deduction of tax) until their minimum shareholding requirements have been met in full.\n\nThe table below shows the Executive Directors' share ownership against the minimum shareholding requirements as at 31 December 2021 and the interest in PLC ordinary shares of the Executive Directors and their connected persons as at 31 December 2021.\n\nWhen calculating an Executive Director's personal shareholding, the following methodology is used:\n\n- \u25aa fixed pay at the date of measurement;\n- \u25aa shares in PLC will qualify provided they are personally owned by the Executive Director, by a member of their (immediate) family or by certain corporate bodies, trusts or partnerships, as required by law from time to time (each a 'connected person');\n- \u25aa shares purchased under the legacy MCIP or legacy GSIP, whether from the annual bonus or otherwise, will qualify as from the moment of purchase as these are held in the individual's name and are not subject to further restrictions;\n- \u25aa shares or entitlements to shares that are subject only to the Executive Director remaining in employment will qualify on a net of tax basis (including deferred bonus awards);\n- \u25aa shares awarded on a conditional basis by way of the legacy MCIP or legacy GSIP will not qualify until the moment of vesting (i.e. once the precise number of shares is fixed after the four-year vesting period for the legacy MCIP or three-year vesting period for the legacy GSIP has elapsed);\n- \u25aa shares awarded on a conditional basis under the PSP will not qualify until the moment of vesting (i.e. once the precise number of shares is fixed after the three-year vesting period for PSP has elapsed); and\n- \u25aa the shares will be valued on the date of measurement or, if that outcome fails the personal shareholding test, on the date of acquisition. The share price for the relevant measurement date will be based on the average closing share prices and the euro/sterling/US dollar exchange rates from the 60 calendar days prior to the measurement date.\n\nAny Executive Director who leaves after the date of the Remuneration Policy took effect will be required to maintain at least 100% of their minimum shareholding requirement for two years after leaving (or if less, their actual shareholding on the date of leaving). ULE members are required to build a shareholding of 400% of fixed pay (500% for the CEO). This requirement is 250% of fixed pay for the management layer below ULE.\n\nExecutive Directors' shareholdings are ring-fenced to ensure they meet the minimum shareholding requirement, including for two years after leaving. This means that even if the shares are vested, they are blocked until the end of the minimum shareholding requirement period (excluding any shares above the minimum shareholding requirement).\n\n## Executive Directors' and their connected persons' interests in shares and share ownership (Audited)\n\nShares held as at\n\nShares held as at\n\n|                       | Share ownership  guideline as % of  fixed pay (as at 31  December 2021)   | Actual share  ownership as a %  of fixed pay (as  at 31 December  2021) (a)   | 1 January 2021 PLC ADS   | PLC     | 31 December 2021 (b) PLC ADS   |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|\n| CEO: Alan Jope        | 500%                                                                      | 789%                                                                          | 214,714                  | 43,251  | 223,140                        |\n| CFO: Graeme Pitkethly | 400%                                                                      | 717%                                                                          | -                        | 182,058 | -                              |\n\nDuring the period between 31 December 2021 and 24 February 2022, the following changes in interests have occurred:\n\n- \u25aa Graeme Pitkethly purchased 6 PLC shares under the PLC ShareBuy Plan: 3 on 11 January 2022 at a share price of \u00a339.20, and a further 3 on 8 February 2022 at a share price of \u00a338.64; and\n- \u25aa as detailed under heading (D) on page 91, on 16 February 2022:\n- \u25aa Graeme Pitkethly acquired 13,280 PLC shares following the vesting of his 2018 MCIP award.\n- \u25aa Alan Jope acquired 14,252 PLC ADS shares following the vesting of his 2018 MCIP award; and\n\nThe voting rights of the Directors (Executive and Non-Executive) and members of the ULE who hold interests in the share capital of PLC are the same as for other holders of the class of shares indicated. As at 24 February 2022, none of the Directors' (Executive and Non-Executive) or other ULE members' shareholdings amounted to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of share. All shareholdings in the table above are beneficial. On page 76 the full share capital of PLC has been described. Pages 131 and 132 set out how many shares Unilever held to satisfy the awards under the share plans.\n\n## Information in relation to outstanding share incentive awards\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, Alan Jope held awards over a total of 139,664 shares which are subject to performance conditions and a total of 5,743 shares which are not subject to performance conditions, and Graeme Pitkethly held awards over a total of 112,343 shares which are subject to performance conditions and a total of 3,461 shares which are not subject to performance conditions.

The Committee will review the fees again in 2022.\n\nThe table below outlines the current fee structure with fees set in euros and paid by Unilever PLC (in sterling) shown using the average exchange rate over the year of \u00a31 = \u20ac0.8605 (rounded).\n\n| Roles and responsibilities                              | 2022 Annual Fee \u20ac   | 2021 Annual Fee \u20ac   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Basic Non-Executive Director Fee                        | 95,753              | 95,753              |\n| Chair (all-inclusive)                                   | 732,225             | 732,225             |\n| Senior Independent Director (modular)                   | 45,060              | 45,060              |\n| Member of Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee | 16,898              | 16,898              |\n| Member of Compensation Committee                        | 20,277              | 20,277              |\n| Member of Corporate Responsibility Committee            | 16,898              | 16,898              |\n| Member of Audit Committee                               | 25,910              | 25,910              |\n| Chair of Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  | 33,795              | 33,795              |\n| Chair of Compensation Committee                         | 33,795              | 33,795              |\n| Chair of Corporate Responsibility Committee             | 33,795              | 33,795              |\n| Chair of Audit Committee                                | 45,060              | 45,060              |\n\nAll reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by Non-Executive Directors in the course of performing their duties are considered to be business expenses and so are reimbursed. Non-Executive Directors also receive expenses relating to the attendance of their spouse or partner, when they are invited by Unilever.\n\nNote, the Committee decided to update the foreign exchange (FX) rate used to disclose Non-Executive Director fees from 1 January 2022 to align with the FX rate used for other reporting in the DRR (i.e. average FX rate for the reporting year (\u20ac1 = \u00a30.8605 for 2021) rather than a fixed exchange rate). This explains the change to the 2021 annual fees set out above compared to the 2020 DRR. Non-Executive Director fees are paid in GBP, therefore, actual pay to Non-Executive Directors will remain consistent.",

        "page_content": "## Other disclosures related to Directors' remuneration (Unaudited)\n\nUnilever regularly looks at pay ratios throughout the Group, and the pay ratio between each work level, and we have disclosed this for a number of years. The table below provides a detailed breakdown of the fixed and variable pay elements for each of our UK work levels, showing how each work level compares to the CEO and CFO in 2021 (with equivalent figures from 2020 included for comparison purposes).\n\n## CEO/CFO Pay Ratio Comparison (split by fixed/variable pay)\n\nFigures for the CEO and CFO are calculated using the data from the Executive Directors' single figure table on page 89. The year-on-year comparison reflects an increase in total compensation for the Executive Directors in 2021 following the significant drop in total compensation for the Executive Directors as a result of the lower performance outcomes on bonus and LTI in 2020. The numbers are further impacted by fluctuation in the exchange rates used to convert pay elements denominated in pounds sterling to euros for reporting purposes. Where relevant, amounts for 2020 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2020 (\u20ac1 = \u00a30.8877), and amounts for 2021 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2021 (\u20ac1 = 0.8605).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual bonus and LTI for the UK employees were not calculated following the statutory method for single figure pay. Instead, variable pay figures were calculated using:\n\n- \u25aa target annual bonus values multiplied by the actual bonus performance ratio for the respective year (disregarding personal performance multipliers, which equal out across the population as a whole); and\n- \u25aa MCIP values calculated at an appropriate average for the relevant work level of employees, i.e. an average 20% investment of bonus for WL2 employees; 45% for WL3 employees; 60% for WL4-5 employees; and 100% for WL6 employees, multiplied by the actual MCIP business performance ratio.\n\nFixed pay figures reflect all elements of pay (including allowances) and benefits paid in cash.",

Figures are calculated by reference to 31 December 2021, and the respective salary and pay and benefits figures for each quartile are set out in the table above. Full-time equivalent figures are calculated on a prorated basis.\n\nVariable pay figures for the UK employees are calculated on the basis set out in the paragraph for other work levels below the 'CEO/CFO pay ratio comparison' table. The reason for this is it would be unduly onerous to recalculate these figures when, based on a sample, the impact of such recalculation is expected to be minimal.\n\nYear-on-year comparisons reflects the increase in performance related pay outcomes in 2021 compared to 2020. CEO total pay in 2021 increased by 42% from 2020, notably due to performance related pay, which form a larger portion of CEO pay. In comparison, total pay for UK employees increased by 8% (at median percentile) given a high proportion of UK employees are below management level and therefore have a lower weighting on performance related pay compared to the CEO. For the overall UK employee calculation, total pay has increased by approximately 8% (at median percentile), which is aligned to our defined peer group at the 50th percentile (market median), that we benchmark against on a yearly basis. The median ratio is considered to be consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies within Unilever as the Remuneration Policy is applicable across our 14,300+ managers throughout the whole business worldwide.\n\nAdditionally, in the UK we are required to show additional disclosures on the rates of change in pay year on year. The pay ratios set out above are more meaningful as they compare to the pay of all of our UK employees. By contrast, the UK regulations require us to show the percentages below based on employees of our PLC top company only, which forms a relatively small proportion of our total UK workforce. So, whilst operationally we may pay greater attention to our internal pay ratios (included above in the 'CEO/CFO pay ratio comparison' table), these required figures are set out on the following page.",

The remuneration and fees earned from that particular outside listed directorship may be retained (see 'Independence and Conflicts' on page 69 for further details).\n\nFor the reason above, Graeme Pitkethly is permitted to be a Non-Executive Director of Pearson PLC since 1 May 2019.

The Committee's terms of reference are contained within 'The Governance of Unilever'.\n\nSee the Board and Management Committees section of our website for a copy of the Committee's terms of reference.\n\nAs part of the Board evaluation carried out in 2021, the Board evaluated the performance of the Committee. The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2021. Overall, the Committee members concluded that the Committee is performing effectively. The Committee has agreed to further enhance its effectiveness by continuing to monitor the effectiveness of performance measures for incentives and their link to Company strategy and the assessment of the Company's talent bank and suitability for growth initiatives.\n\n## Advisers\n\nWhile it is the Committee's responsibility to exercise independent judgement, the Committee does request advice from management and professional advisers, as appropriate, to ensure that its decisions are fully informed given the internal and external environment.\n\nFiona Camenzuli of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) provided the Committee with independent advice on various matters it considered. During 2021, the wider PwC firm has also provided tax and consultancy services to Unilever including tax compliance, transfer pricing, other taxrelated services, managed legal services, internal audit advice and secondees, third-party risk and compliance advice, cyber security advice, sustainability assurance and consulting, merger and acquisition support, and media assurance support. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK, which is available online.\n\nwww.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com (Code of Conduct: Executive Remuneration Consulting)\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the PwC engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with PLC that might impair their independence. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts. The fees paid to PwC in relation to advice provided to the Committee in the year to 31 December 2021 were \u00a3137,100. This figure is calculated based on time spent and expenses incurred for the majority of advice provided, but on occasion, for specific projects, a fixed fee may be agreed.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee also sought input from the CEO (Alan Jope), the Chief Human Resources Officer (Leena Nair) and the VP Global Head of Reward (Constantina Tribou) on various subjects including the remuneration of senior management. No individual Executive Director was present when their own remuneration was being determined to ensure a conflict of interest did not arise, although the Committee has separately sought and obtained Executive Directors' own views when determining the amount and structure of their remuneration before recommending individual packages to the Board for approval. The Committee also received legal and governance advice from the Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary (Ritva Sotamaa) and the Chief Counsel Executive Compensation & Employment (Margot Fransen).\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nUnilever remains committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue and takes an active interest in voting outcomes. In the event of a substantial vote against a resolution in relation to Directors' remuneration, Unilever would seek to understand the reasons for any such vote and would set out in the following Annual Report and Accounts any actions in response to it. The following table sets out actual voting in respect of this and previous report:\n\n| Voting outcome (% of votes)                    | For    | Against   | Withheld   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|------------|\n| 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report (2021 AGM) |        |           |            |\n| (excluding the Directors' Remuneration Policy) | 96.88% | 3.12%     | 7,962,282  |\n| 2021 Directors' Remuneration Policy (2021 AGM) | 93.51% | 6.49%     | 8,161,369  |\n\nThe Directors' Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board, and signed on their behalf by Ritva Sotamaa, Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary.",

The Directors are also required by the UK Companies Act 2006 to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Unilever Group and PLC as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss and cash flows for that year.\n\nThe Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts, the Group and PLC have used the most appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and UK-adopted international accounting standards, which they consider to be applicable have been followed. The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts including the consolidated financial statements in the European single electronic format in accordance with the requirements as set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format.\n\nThe Directors have responsibility for ensuring that PLC keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy their financial position and which enable the Directors to ensure that the accounts comply with all relevant legislation. They also have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThis statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Independent Auditor's Report, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the auditors in relation to the accounts.\n\nA copy of the financial statements of the Unilever Group is placed on our website at www.unilever.com/investorrelations. The maintenance and integrity of the website are the responsibility of the Directors, and the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters. Accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially placed on the website. Legislation in the UK and the Netherlands governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Independent auditors and disclosure of information to auditors\n\nUK law sets out additional responsibilities for the Directors of PLC regarding disclosure of information to auditors. To the best of each of the Directors' knowledge and belief, and having made appropriate enquiries, all information relevant to enabling the auditors to provide their opinions on PLC's consolidated and parent company accounts has been provided. Each of the Directors has taken all reasonable steps to ensure their awareness of any relevant audit information and to establish that Unilever PLC's auditors are aware of any such information.\n\n## Directors' responsibility statement\n\nEach of the Directors confirms that, to the best of his or her knowledge:\n\n- \u25aa The Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u25aa The financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and UKadopted international accounting standards give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- \u25aa The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of PLC and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nThe Directors and their roles are listed on pages 72 to 73.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe activities of the Group, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance, the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 1 to 43. In addition, we describe in notes 15 to 18 on pages 144 to 159 the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk. Although not assessed over the same period as going concern, the viability of the Group has been assessed on page 45.\n\nThe Group has considerable financial resources together with established business relationships with many customers and suppliers in countries throughout the world. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\n\nAfter making enquiries, the Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing this Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Internal and disclosure controls and procedures\n\nPlease refer to pages 46 to 50 for a discussion of Unilever's principal risk factors and to pages 44 to 50 for commentary on the Group's approach to risk management and control.",

Following Unification in November 2020 the Group is represented by Unilever PLC and the entities controlled by Unilever PLC and the Consolidated Financial Statements are therefore solely audited by KPMG LLP (Unilever N.V. ceased to exist as of the merger date).\n\n## 2. Key audit matters: Our assessment of risks of material misstatement\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinions above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required, for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

        "page_content": "## Revenue recognition Discounts\n\nAs discussed in the report of the Audit Committee (page 78), note 2, note 13 and note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the rebate accrual was \u20ac4,004 million as of 31 December 2021 and \u20ac3,852 million as of 31 December 2020.\n\n## Indirect tax contingent liabilities in Brazil\n\nAs discussed in the Report of the Audit Committee (page 78) and note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, there are contingent liabilities reported for indirect taxes relating to disputes with the Brazilian authorities related to a 2001 corporate reorganisation. The total amount of the tax assessments in respect of this matter is  \u20ac2,549 million as of 31 December 2021 and \u20ac2,040 million as of 31 December 2020.\n\n## The key audit matter\n\n## Our response and results\n\nRevenue is measured net of rebates, price reductions, incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs (''discounts'').\n\nCertain discounts for goods sold in the year are only finalised when the precise amounts are known and revenue therefore includes an estimate of variable consideration. The variable consideration represents the portion of discounts that are not directly deducted on the invoice and is complex as a result of diversity in the terms in contractual arrangements with customers. The unsettled portion of the variable consideration results in discounts due to customers at 31 December 2021 ('rebate accrual').\n\nTherefore, there is a risk of revenue being misstated as a result of incorrect calculation of the variable consideration.\n\nWithin revenue recognition we identified the rebate accrual as a key audit matter, as in a number of markets the rebate accrual is significant and the terms in contractual arrangements with customers are not uniform.\n\nThis is considered to be an area which had a significant effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in planning and completing our audit as significant effort was required in evaluating the contractual arrangements and the related rebate accrual.\n\nThere is also a risk that revenue may be overstated due to fraud through manipulation of the rebate accrual recognised resulting from the pressure management may feel to achieve performance targets.\n\nWe identified the assessment of indirect tax contingent liabilities in Brazil related to a 2001 corporate reorganisation as a key audit matter.\n\nIn Brazil, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local indirect tax regimes (both state and federal) and jurisprudence, related to certain corporate reorganisations. Due to these complexities, there is a high degree of judgement applied by the Group with respect to the uncertainty of the outcome of this matter. Complex auditor's judgement and specialised skills were also required in assessing the outcome of investigations by the authorities, if a liability exists and in making an estimate of any economic outflows.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter in a selected number of markets:\n\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the revenue process including controls over the rebate agreements, calculation of the rebate accrual and controls over rebate claims.\n- \u00b7 Within the Group's relevant markets, used the prior year rebate accrual together with our understanding of current year developments to form an expectation of the rebate accrual at 31 December 2021. We compared this expectation against the actual rebate accrual, completing further corroborative inquiries and obtained underlying documentation as appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Tested a selection of recorded rebate accruals after 31 December 2021 and assessed whether the accrual is recorded in the proper period.\n- \u00b7 Tested a selection of payments made after 31 December 2021 and assessed whether the original accrual was recorded in the proper period.\n- \u00b7 Critically assessed manual journals recorded to revenue to identify unusual or irregular items and obtained underlying documentation.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the adequacy of Group's disclosures in respect of the rebate accrual.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory (2020: satisfactory) and we considered the rebate accrual disclosures to be acceptable (2020: acceptable).\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indirect tax process including controls around the assessment of the outcome of investigations if a liability exists and the quantification of the potential economic outflow.\n- \u00b7 We involved local indirect tax professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n- \u00b7 assessing the appropriateness of the contingent liabilities compared to the nature of the exposures, applicable regulations and related correspondence with the tax authorities; and\n- \u00b7 assessing the impact of historical and recent judgements passed by the court authorities in considering any legal precedent or case law by inquiring of the Group's external lawyers and inspection of relevant information, on the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources.\n- \u00b7 We inspected legal opinions from third party lawyers and obtained formal confirmations from the Group's external lawyers and, where relevant, compared to the underlying exposure.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory (2020: satisfactory) and we considered the Brazilian indirect tax contingent liability disclosures to be acceptable (2020: acceptable).",

        "page_content": "## The key audit matter\n\n## Our response and results\n\nOn 18 November 2021, Unilever announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell their global Tea business, ekaterra, to CVC Capital Partner Fund VIII for \u20ac4.5 billion and expects that the divestment will be completed within the next 12 months of the balance sheet date. ekaterra continues to be reported within continuing operations and is recognised as assets held for sale under IFRS 5, as at 31 December 2021. Liabilities closely associated with such assets held for sale have been recognised as liabilities held for sale under IFRS 5, as at 31 December 2021.\n\nWe identified the presentation of assets and liabilities held for sale as a Key Audit Matter as the application of IFRS 5 has higher complexity relative to other areas of the audit and requires additional auditor effort, particularly in evaluating the timing of when the asset held for sale criteria has been met. This is considered to be an area which had a significant effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in planning and completing our audit.\n\nOn 1 January 2021, an intellectual property swap transaction occurred between the Company and certain Group entities resulting in transfer of intellectual property related to Foods and Refreshment by the Company to a Group entity in exchange for intellectual property related to Home Care and Beauty and Personal Care (HC BPC). Thereafter the Company transferred the intellectual property related to HC BPC to another Group entity. The Directors applied judgement to determine that the transaction had commercial substance and therefore was recorded at fair value.\n\nWe identified the accounting for the transaction as a key audit matter due to the magnitude of the unrealised gain in the context of the Company Accounts. We spent a significant amount of time and resources on the transaction to assess the fair value of the intangible assets, the interpretation of UK and Dutch tax law as well as the interpretation of financial reporting standards.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Group's controls over the determination of the timing of the classification of the ekaterra assets and liabilities as held for sale;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the Group's application of the IFRS 5 criteria to present the ekaterra assets and liabilities as held for sale by evaluating compliance with IFRS 5 classification criteria;\n- \u00b7 We inspected the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement to identify the assets and liabilities relating to ekaterra; and\n- \u00b7 We assessed the adequacy of Group's disclosures in respect of the assets and liabilities held for sale.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory and we found the presentation of assets held for sale to be acceptable.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the accounting for the transaction considering the requirements under the applicable financial reporting standards.\n- \u00b7 We involved tax professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist in evaluating the tax impact of the transaction, based on the applicable laws and regulations.\n- \u00b7 We involved valuation professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist in evaluating the methodology applied to determine the fair value.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in respect of this transaction in the Company Accounts.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Company's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the accounting for the transaction to be acceptable.\n\nIn the prior year, we reported key audit matters in respect of uncertain direct tax transfer pricing provisions, valuation of Horlicks Brand acquired from GSK and accounting for the Unification of Unilever's Corporate structure. We continue to perform procedures over uncertain direct tax transfer pricing provisions. However, pursuant to settlements with tax authorities in FY 2020 resulting in a reduction in the value and quantum of the exposure, we have not assessed this as one of the most significant risks in our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year. The key audit matters in relation to the valuation of Horlicks Brand acquired from GSK and accounting for the Unification of Unilever's Corporate structure related to transactions in 2020.\n\n## 3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## Materiality\n\nMateriality for the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole was set at \u20ac380 million (2020: \u20ac380 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, of which it represents 4.4% (2020: 4.8%). Materiality for the Company Accounts as a whole was set at \u00a3296 million (2020: \u00a3298 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Company Net Assets, of which it represents 0.4% (2020: 0.4%).\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company Accounts set at 75% (2020: 75%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u20ac285 million for the Group (2020: \u20ac285 million) and \u00a3222 million (2020: \u00a3224 million) for the Company. We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding \u20ac20 million (2020: \u20ac20 million) and \u00a314 million (2020: \u00a315 million) which are identified during the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Company Accounts respectively, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Overall scope of our audit\n\nThe Group operates through a significant number of legal entities and these form reporting components that are primarily country based. To provide sufficient coverage over the Group's key audit matters, we performed audits of 15 components (2020: 15), which are included within 'Audit for group reporting purposes' below, as well as audits of account balances including revenue and the related accounts receivables balances at a further 22 (2020: 22) components which are included within 'Audit of account balances' below. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes but were included in the scope of our group reporting work in order to provide additional coverage.\n\nThe Group operates centralised operating centres in China, India, Mexico, Philippines and Poland that perform accounting and reporting activities alongside related controls. Together, these operating centres process a substantial portion of the Group's transactions. The outputs from the centralised operating centres are included in the financial information of the reporting components they service and therefore they are not separate reporting components. Each of the operating centres is subject to specified audit procedures. Further audit procedures are performed at each reporting component to cover matters not covered at the centralised operating centres and together this results in audits for group reporting purposes on those reporting components.\n\nDisposal of Tea business Presentation of Assets held for Sale\n\nAs discussed in the Report of the Audit Committee (page 78) and note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale were \u20ac2,375 million and \u20ac820 million, respectively as of 31 December 2021.\n\n## Accounting for swap transaction of intellectual property rights\n\n(Applicable to Company Accounts only)\n\nAs discussed in the critical accounting estimates and judgements section on page 171 and in note 4 of the Company Accounts, the unrealised gain recorded in income statement was \u00a32,815 million and increase in investment in Unilever Global IP Limited was \u00a32,259 million for the year ended 31 December 2021.",

A substantial portion of these components utilise the operating centres and are therefore subject to audit procedures performed at these operating centres. For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the key audit matters detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from \u20ac4 million to \u20ac344 million (2020: \u20ac1 million to \u20ac328 million), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on components was performed by component auditors.\n\nIn view of the continued restrictions on the movement of people across borders the Group audit team's planned audit approach involved using video conferencing to oversee the component auditor work and to hold video discussions with management of selected component locations in scope of the Group audit. Furthermore, to evaluate the component auditors' communications and the adequacy of their work, we requested those component auditors to provide us with remote access to audit workpapers to perform these evaluations, subject to local law and regulations. In addition, due to the inability to arrange in-person meetings with such component auditors, we increased the use of alternative methods of communication with them, including through written instructions, exchange of emails and virtual meetings.\n\nThe Group audit team held virtual meetings with local management in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, UK, USA, UAE and South Africa (2020: virtual meetings with local management in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, UK and USA). Online meetings were also held with the component auditors in these locations and majority of the other locations in scope for group reporting. The findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail with component auditors and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditors.\n\nThe work on 36 of the 37 components (2020: 36 of the 37 components) was performed by component auditors (KPMG member firms). The audit of the company was performed by the Group audit team.\n\nWe were able to rely upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting in all areas of our audit, and where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the scope of our substantive audit work.\n\n## 4. The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we considered the potential impacts of risks arising from climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements. The Group has set out its targets under its Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) to reduce operational emissions by 100% by 2030; with an interim goal to achieve a 70% reduction by 2025 against a 2015 baseline, to halve the full value chain emissions of its products on a per consumer use basis by 2030 against a 2010 baseline and to achieve net zero emissions covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2039. Detailed information is provided in the Strategic Report on page 34 and in the CTAP and TCFD sections on pages 51 to 62.\n\nWhilst the Group has set these targets, in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements the Directors have stated that they have considered the impact of climate change risks and that they do not believe that there is a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates and as a result the valuations of the Group's assets and liabilities have not been significantly impacted by these risks as at 31 December 2021.\n\nAs a part of our audit we have performed a risk assessment to determine if the potential impacts of climate change may materially affect the financial statements and our audit. We did this by making inquiries of management and inspecting internal and external reports in order to independently assess the climate-related risks and their potential impact. We held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.\n\nThe most likely potential impact of climate risk and plans on these financial statements would be on the forward-looking assessments of longterm assets.\n\nWe have considered the sensitivity of the assumptions used in the impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets. Given that the assumptions are not considered a major source of estimation uncertainty, the carrying amounts of these assets in the financial statements are not considered to be sensitive to the impact of risks arising from climate change. As a result of this, and the relative size of other long-term assets which could be impacted by climate change risks, we determined that climate related risks did not have a significant impact on our audit and there is no significant impact of these risks on our key audit matters.\n\nWe have also read the Group's disclosures of climate related information in the Strategic Report and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## 5. Going concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the Financial Statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and the Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- \u25aa continued slowdown in the broader macro-economic environment and therefore market growth;\n- \u25aa external pressures on gross margin through cost price inflation.\n- \u25aa increased global and local competition; and\n\nWe also considered realistic second order impacts, such as a major IT data breach and the loss of all material litigation cases which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources. We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumptions that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the",

We considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the Directors' assessment of going concern.\n\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\n- \u25aa we consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Financial Statements is appropriate;\n- \u25aa we have not identified, and concur with the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- \u25aa we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement on page 106 to the Financial Statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure on page 106 to be acceptable; and\n- \u25aa the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 106 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.\n\n## 6. Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations - ability to detect\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u25aa Enquiring of directors, the audit committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group's channel for 'whistleblowing', as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.\n- \u25aa Reading Board and audit committee minutes.\n- \u25aa Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.\n- \u25aa Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for directors.\n- \u25aa Using our own forensic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist us in identifying the fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to in-scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to inscope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we performed procedures to address the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition. Further detail in respect of Revenue recognition - Discounts is set out in the key audit matter disclosures in section 2 of this report. We did not identify any additional fraud risks.\n\nIn determining the audit procedures we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls. For further details in respect to the Group-wide risk management controls refer to the report of the Audit Committee on page 78.\n\nWe also performed procedures including:\n\n- \u25aa Identifying manual journal entries to test for all in-scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation.\n- \u25aa Evaluating the business purpose of significant unusual transactions.\n- \u25aa Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards) and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence. We discussed with the Directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations and we made use of our own forensic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist us in evaluating the facts and circumstances.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to in-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for in-scope component auditors to report to the group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:\n\n- \u25aa Competition legislation (reflecting the Group's involvement in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities),\n- \u25aa Health and safety regulation (reflecting the nature of the Group's production and distribution processes).\n- \u25aa Employment legislation (reflecting the Group's significant and geographically diverse work force).\n- \u25aa Consumer product law such as product safety and product claims (reflecting the nature of the Group's diverse product base).\n- \u25aa Data privacy (requirements from existing data privacy laws).\n- \u25aa Contract legislation (reflecting the Group's extensive use of trademarks, copyright and patents).\n- \u25aa Environmental regulation (reflecting nature of the Group's production and distribution processes).\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

We have nothing to report on the other information\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 together with the Financial Statements. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Strategic report and Directors' report\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information:\n\n- \u25aa we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report and the Directors' report;\n- \u25aa in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n- \u25aa in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the Financial Statements; and\n\n## Directors' remuneration report\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the Directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u25aa the Directors' confirmation within the Viability Statement on page 45 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u25aa the Principal Risk Factors disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \u25aa the Directors' explanation in the Viability Statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the Viability Statement, set out on page 45 under the Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the Directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have concluded that each of the following is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge:\n\n- \u25aa the directors' statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u25aa the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit Committee, including the significant issues that the audit committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and\n- \u25aa the section of the annual report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems.\n\nWe are required to review the part of Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review. We have nothing to report in this respect.\n\n## 8. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u25aa adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u25aa the Company Accounts and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u25aa certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u25aa we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\nWe have nothing to report in these respects.\n\n## 9. Respective Responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 106, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. They are also responsible for: such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud, or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at\n\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group\n\n## 1. Accounting information and policies\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nGroup companies included in the consolidated financial statements for 2021 are PLC and all subsidiary undertakings, which are those entities controlled by PLC. Control exists when the Group has the power to direct the activities of an entity so as to affect the return on investment.\n\nThe net assets and results of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control.\n\nThe results of disposed businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements up to their date of disposal, being the date control ceases.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances are eliminated.\n\nOn 29 November 2020, the Unilever Group underwent a reorganisation so that there were no longer two parent companies, Unilever N.V. ('NV') and Unilever PLC ('PLC'), but one parent company PLC. This reorganisation is referred to as 'Unification' in the Group consolidated financial statements.\n\nPrior to 29 November 2020, the Group operated with two parent companies, NV and PLC, who together with the group companies operated as a single economic entity.\n\n## Company legislation and accounting standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and UK-adopted international accounting standards. The consolidated financial statements comply with Companies Act 2006.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group has considerable financial resources together with established business relationships with many customers and suppliers in countries throughout the world. As a consequence, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are the same as those which were applied for the previous financial year except as set out below under the heading 'Recent accounting developments'.\n\nAccounting policies are included in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. These are presented as text highlighted in grey on pages 118 to 166. The accounting policies below are applied throughout the financial statements.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. The functional currency of PLC is pound sterling. Items included in the financial statements of individual group companies are recorded in their respective functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates.\n\nForeign currency transactions in individual group companies are translated into functional currency using exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses from settlement of these transactions, and from translation of monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying hedges.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the balances in individual group companies are translated from their functional currency into euros. Apart from the financial statements of group companies in hyperinflationary economies (see below), the income statement, the cash flow statement and all other movements in assets and liabilities are translated at average rates of exchange as a proxy for the transaction rate, or at the transaction rate itself if more\n\nappropriate. Assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.\n\nThe financial statements of group companies whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted for inflation and then translated into euros using the balance sheet exchange rate. Amounts shown for prior years for comparative purposes are not modified. To determine the existence of hyperinflation, the Group assesses the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the economic environment of the country, such as the cumulative inflation rate over the previous three years.\n\nThe ordinary share capital of PLC is translated to euro using the historical rate at the date the shares were issued (see note 15B on page 146).\n\nThe effect of exchange rate changes during the year on net assets of foreign operations is recorded in equity. For this purpose, net assets include loans between group companies and any related foreign exchange contracts where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting to certain exchange differences arising between the functional currencies of a foreign operation and the functional currency of the parent entity, regardless of whether the net investment is held directly or through an intermediate parent. Differences arising on retranslation of a financial liability designated as a foreign currency net investment hedge are recorded in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. These differences are reported within profit or loss to the extent that the hedge is ineffective.\n\nCumulative exchange differences arising since the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004 are reported as a separate component of other reserves. In the event of disposal or part disposal of an interest in a group company either through sale or as a result of a repayment of capital, the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of group companies.\n\n## Hyperinflationary economies\n\nThe Argentinian economy was designated as hyperinflationary from 1 July 2018. As a result, application of IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' has been applied to all Unilever entities whose functional currency is the Argentinian Peso. The application of IAS 29 includes:\n\n- \u25aa Adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for the change in purchasing power caused by inflation from the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date;\n- \u25aa Adjustment of the income statement for inflation during the reporting period;\n- \u25aa The income statement is translated at the period-end foreign exchange rate instead of an average rate; and\n- \u25aa Adjustment of the income statement to reflect the impact of inflation and exchange rate movement on holding monetary assets and liabilities in local currency.\n\nThe main effects of the Group consolidated financial statements for 2021 are:\n\n- \u25aa Total assets are increased by \u20ac106 million.\n- \u25aa Operating profit is reduced by \u20ac2 million.\n- \u25aa Turnover is increased by \u20ac124 million.\n- \u25aa A net monetary loss of \u20ac74 million is recognised.\n\n## Climate change\n\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements we have considered the impact of both physical and transition climate change risks on the current valuation of our assets and liabilities. We do not believe that there is a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates arising from our considerations and as a result the valuations of our assets or liabilities have not been significantly impacted by these risks as at 31 December 2021. In concluding, we specifically considered the impact of climate change on the growth rates and projected cash flows as part of our goodwill impairment testing (see note 9). As government policies evolve as a result of commitments to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, we will continue to monitor implications on the valuations of our assets and liabilities that could arise in future years.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and",

        "page_content": "expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected.\n\nThe following estimates are those that management believe have the most significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are:\n\n- \u25aa Measurement of defined benefit obligations - the valuations of the Group's defined benefit pension plan obligations are dependent on a number of assumptions. These include discount rates, inflation and life expectancy of scheme members. Details of these assumptions and sensitivities are in note 4B.\n\nThe following judgements are those that management believe have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Group's financial statements:\n\n- \u25aa Separate presentation of items in the income statement - certain items of income or expense are presented separately as nonunderlying items. These are excluded in several of our performance measures, including underlying operating profit and underlying earnings per share due to their nature and/or frequency of occurrence. See note 3 for further details.\n- \u00b7 Disclosure of ekaterra assets and liabilities - following the announcement to dispose of part of our Tea business ('ekaterra'), management has assessed whether this would meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. As the contribution of\n\nekaterra to the overall Group is approximately 4% of Group turnover and 3% of total assets, management has concluded that it does not represent a separate major line of business, nor separate component of the Group and so should not be presented as a discontinued operation. ekaterra assets and liabilities have been presented in the financial statements as held for sale - see note 22.\n\n- \u25aa Utilisation of tax losses and recognition of other deferred tax assets the Group operates in many countries and is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Management uses judgement to assess the recoverability of tax assets such as whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits to utilise losses - see note 6B.\n- \u25aa Likelihood of occurrence of provisions and contingent liabilities events can occur where there is uncertainty over future obligations. Judgement is required to determine if an outflow of economic resources is probable, or possible but not probable. Where it is probable, a liability is recognised and further judgement is used to determine the level of the provision. Where it is possible but not probable, further judgement is used to determine if the likelihood is remote, in which case no disclosures are provided; if the likelihood is not remote then judgement is used to determine the contingent liability disclosed. Unilever does not have provisions and contingent liabilities for the same matters. External advice is obtained for any material cases.

Segment information\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nBeauty & Personal Care\n\nFoods & Refreshment\n\nHome Care\n\n- \u25aa primarily sales of skin cleansing (soap, shower), hair care (shampoo, conditioner, styling), skin care (face, hand and body moisturisers) and deodorant categories.\n- \u25aa primarily sales of ice cream, savoury (soups, bouillons, seasoning), dressings (mayonnaise, ketchup) and tea (including ekaterra) categories.\n- \u00b7 primarily sales of fabric care (washing powders and liquids, rinse conditioners) and a wide range of cleaning products.\n\n## Revenue\n\nTurnover comprises sales of goods after the deduction of discounts, sales taxes and estimated returns. It does not include sales between group companies. Discounts given by Unilever include rebates, price reductions and incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs and are based on the contractual arrangements with each customer. Discounts can either be immediately deducted from the sales value on the invoice or off-invoice and settled later through credit notes when the precise amounts are known. Rebates are generally off-invoice. Amounts provided for discounts at the end of a period require estimation; historical data and accumulated experience is used to estimate the provision using the most likely amount method and in most instances, the discount can be estimated using known facts with a high level of accuracy. Any differences between actual amounts settled and the amounts provided are not material and recognised in the subsequent reporting period.\n\nCustomer contracts generally contain a single performance obligation and turnover is recognised when control of the products being sold has transferred to our customer as there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations to the customer. This is generally on delivery to the customer but depending on individual customer terms, this can be at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. This is considered the appropriate point where the performance obligations in our contracts are satisfied as Unilever no longer has control over the inventory.\n\nOur customers have the contractual right to return goods only when authorised by Unilever. At 31 December 2021, an estimate has been made of goods that will be returned and a liability has been recognised for this amount. An asset has also been recorded for the corresponding inventory that is estimated to return to Unilever using a best estimate based on accumulated experience.\n\nSome of our customers are distributors who may be able to return unsold goods in consignment arrangements.\n\n## Underlying operating profit\n\nUnderlying operating profit means operating profit before the impact of non-underlying items within operating profit (see note 3). Underlying operating profit represents our measure of segment profit or loss as it is the primary measure used for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of segments. Underlying operating margin is calculated as underlying operating profit divided by turnover.\n\nOur segments are comprised of similar product categories. 10 categories (2020: 10; 2019: 9) individually accounted for 5% or more of our revenue in one or more of the last three years. The following table shows the relevant contribution of these categories to Group revenue for the periods shown:\n\nCategory\n\nSegment\n\n|                |                        | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fabric         | Home Care              | 14%    | 14%    | 15%    |\n| Ice Cream      | Foods & Refreshment    | 13%    | 13%    | 13%    |\n| Skin Cleansing | Beauty & Personal Care | 11%    | 12%    | 10%    |\n| Hair Care      | Beauty & Personal Care | 11%    | 11%    | 12%    |\n| Savoury        | Foods & Refreshment    | 10%    | 11%    | 11%    |\n| Deodorant      | Beauty & Personal Care | 7%     | 8 %    | 8 %    |\n| Skin Care      | Beauty & Personal Care | 7%     | 7 %    | 8 %    |\n| Dressings      | Foods & Refreshment    | 6%     | 6%     | 5%     |\n| Tea*           | Foods & Refreshment    | 5%     | 6%     | 6%     |\n| Home & Hygiene | Home Care              | 5%     | 5%     | 4%     |\n| Other          |                        | 11%    | 7 %    | 8 %    |\n\n- * Tea includes ekaterra as well as the retained tea business.",

Compensation for the ULE includes the full-year compensation for ULE members who joined part way through the year.\n\nDetails of the remuneration of Directors are given in the parts noted as audited in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 104.\n\n## 4B. Pensions and similar obligations\n\nFor defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement. The amount charged to operating cost in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments (such events are recognised immediately in the income statement). The amount charged or credited to finance costs is a net interest expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Any differences between the expected interest on assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities (using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market).\n\nAll defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method by external consultants. The Group policy is that the most material plans, representing approximately 86% of the defined benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year. Other material plans, accounting for a further 10% of the liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year. Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years. Asset values for all plans are updated every year.\n\nFor defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the company contributions payable, as the company's obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans. The assets and liabilities of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.\n\n## Description of plans\n\nThe Group increasingly operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds. In certain countries, the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service. The majority of defined benefit plans are either career average, final salary or hybrid plans and operate on a funded basis with assets held in external funds. Benefits are determined by the plan rules and are linked to inflation in some countries. Our largest plans are in the UK and the Netherlands. In the UK, we operate a career average defined benefit plan (with a salary limit for benefit accrual) which is closed to new entrants, and a defined contribution plan. In the Netherlands, we operate a collective defined contribution plan for all new benefit accrual and a closed career average defined benefit plan for benefits built up to April 2015.\n\nThe Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the US. These plans are predominantly unfunded.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe majority of the Group's externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities. The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Where Trustees (or equivalent) are in place to operate plans, they are generally required to act on behalf of the plan's stakeholders. They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the plan in accordance with local legislation and play a role in the long-term investment and funding strategy. The Group also has an internal body, the Pensions and Equity Committee, that is responsible for setting the company's policies and decision-making on plan matters, including but not limited to design, funding, investments, risk management and governance.",

Pensions and similar obligations continued\n\n## Investment strategy\n\nThe Group's investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based. The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided. To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. The plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and, in certain countries, inflation risk. There are no unusual entity or plan-specific risks to the Group. The plans invest a reducing proportion of assets in equities and, for risk control, an increasing proportion in liability matching assets (bonds). There are also investments in property and other alternative assets; additionally, the Group uses derivatives to further mitigate the impact of the risks outlined above. The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house. Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle (Univest) which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and alternative assets. The aim is to provide high-quality, well diversified, cost-effective, riskcontrolled vehicles. The pension plans' investments are overseen by Unilever's internal investment company, the Univest Company.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nWith the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities vary according to the country in which the plan is situated. The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal defined benefit plans (representing approximately 96% of total pension liabilities and other post-employment benefit liabilities).\n\n|                                                             | 31 December 2021              | 31 December 2021                      | 31 December 2020              | 31 December 2020                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | Defined benefit pension plans | Other post-  employment benefit plans | Defined benefit pension plans | Other post-  employment benefit plans |\n| Discount rate                                               | 1.8 %                         | 3.6 %                                 | 1 . 3  %                      | 3 . 3  %                              |\n| Inflation                                                   | 2.6 %                         | n/a                                   | 2 . 2  %                      | n/a                                   |\n| Rate of increase in salaries                                | 3.2 %                         | 3.0 %                                 | 2 . 9  %                      | 3 . 0  %                              |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment (where provided)   | 2.5 %                         | n/a                                   | 2 . 1  %                      | n/a                                   |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in deferment (where provided) | 2.7 %                         | n/a                                   | 2 . 3  %                      | n/a                                   |\n| Long-term medical cost inflation                            | n/a                           | 5.1 %                                 | n/a                           | 5 . 1  %                              |\n\nThe valuations of other post-employment benefit plans generally assume a higher initial level of medical cost inflation, which falls from 7% to the long-term rate after five years. Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.\n\nDuring 2021, changes were made to our discount rate assumption setting methodology to reflect changes made more generally by corporates and their advisers which resulted in a \u20ac200 million higher liability.\n\nFor the UK and Netherlands pension plans, representing approximately 70% of all defined benefit pension liabilities, the assumptions used at 31 December 2021 and 2020 were:\n\n|                                                                                          | United Kingdom   | United Kingdom   | Netherlands   | Netherlands   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                                          | 2021             | 2020             | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Discount rate                                                                            | 1.9 %            | 1.4%             | 1.1%          | 0.7%          |\n| Inflation                                                                                | 3.2 %            | 2.7%             | 1.9%          | 1.5%          |\n| Rate of increase in salaries                                                             | 3.7 %            | 3.3%             | 2.4%          | 2.0%          |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment (where provided)                                | 3.1 %            | 2.7%             | 1.9%          | 1.5%          |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in deferment (where provided)                              | 3.1 %            | 2.7%             | 1.9%          | 1.5%          |\n| Number of years a current pensioner is expected to live beyond age 65:                   |                  |                  |               |               |\n| Men                                                                                      | 21.8             | 21.7             | 21.6          | 21.5          |\n| Women                                                                                    | 23.6             | 23.4             | 23.7          | 23.6          |\n| Number of years a future pensioner currently aged 45 is expected to live beyond  age 65: |                  |                  |               |               |\n| Men                                                                                      | 22.8             | 22.7             | 23.5          | 23.4          |\n| Women                                                                                    | 24.8             | 24.6             | 25.5          | 25.4          |\n\nDemographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set with having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy (including expectations of future improvements), plan experience and other relevant data. These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans. The years of life expectancy for 2021 above have been translated from the following tables:\n\nUK : Standard life expectancy tables Series S3, adjusted to reflect the experience of our plan members analysed as part of the 2019 actuarial valuation. Future improvements in longevity have been allowed for in line with the core CMI 2018 Mortality Projections Model with a 1% p.a. longterm improvement rate.\n\nNetherlands: The Dutch Actuarial Society's AG Prognosetafel 2020 table is used with correction factors (2020) to allow for the typically longer life expectancy for fund members relative to the general population. This table has an in-built allowance for future improvements in longevity.\n\nThe impact from changes to the assumptions of the remaining defined benefit plans are considered immaterial. Their assumptions vary due to a number of factors including the currency and long-term economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.",

The fair value of private equity, properties, derivatives and hedge funds are not based on quoted market prices in active markets. The Group uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge some of its exposure to inflation and interest rate risk - the degree of this hedging of liabilities was 100% for both interest rate and inflation for the UK plan and 35% for interest rate and 19% for inflation for the Netherlands plan. Foreign currency exposures, in part, are also hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. Assets included in the Other category are cash and insurance contracts which are also unquoted assets.\n\nEquity securities include Unilever securities amounting to \u20ac1 million (0.002% of total plan assets) and \u20ac9 million (0.04% of total plan assets) at 31 December 2021 and 2020 respectively. Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to \u20ac74 million and \u20ac29 million at 31 December 2021 and 2020 respectively.\n\nThe pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Benefits Trust amounting to \u20ac38 million (2020: \u20ac44 million) to fund pension and similar obligations in the US (see also note 17A on page 157).\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe sensitivity of the overall pension liabilities to changes in the weighted key assumptions are:\n\n|                                      | Change in assumption   | UK     | Netherlands   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|--------|---------------|---------|\n| Discount rate                        | Increase by 0.5%       | - 8  % | - 8  %        | - 8  %  |\n| Inflation rate                       | Increase by 0.5%       | 7  %   | 9  %          | 6  %    |\n| Life expectancy                      | Increase by 1 year     | 6  %   | 5  %          | 5  %    |\n| Long-term medical cost inflation (a) | Increase by 1.0%       | 0  %   | 0  %          | 3  %    |\n\nChange in liabilities\n\nAn equivalent decrease in each assumption would have an equal and opposite impact on liabilities.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change. It is based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous period.",

Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe fair value of awards at grant date is calculated using observable market price. This value is expensed over their vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity. The expense is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes to the level of awards expected to vest, except where this arises from a failure to meet a market condition. Any cancellations are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares and other share awards.\n\nThe numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 104 and those for key management shown in note 4A on page 125. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.\n\nThe charge in each of the last three years is shown below, and relates to equity-settled plans:\n\n| Income statement charge   | \u20ac  million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Performance share plans   | (150)             | (98)             | (142)            |\n| Other plans               | (11)              | (10)             | (9)              |\n|                           | (161)             | (108)            | (151)            |\n\n## Performance share plans\n\nPerformance share awards are made in respect of the Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP) and Performance Share Plan (PSP). Awards for the Global Share Incentive Plan (GSIP) were last made in February 2018 and vested in February 2021. No further MCIP or GSIP awards will be made. The awards of each plan will vest between 0% and 200% of grant level, subject to the level of satisfaction of performance measures (limits for Executive Directors may vary and are detailed in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 104).\n\nThe MCIP allowed Unilever's managers to invest up to 100% of their annual bonus (a minimum of 33% and maximum of 67% for Executive Directors) in shares in Unilever, and to receive a corresponding award of performance-related shares. From 2021, under the PSP, Unilever's managers receive annual awards of PLC shares. The performance measures for MCIP and PSP are underlying sales growth, underlying EPS growth, return on invested capital and sustainability progress index for the Group. MCIP awards made will vest after four years, while PSP awards vest after three years.\n\nA summary of the status of the Performance Share Plans as at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 and changes during the years ended on these dates is presented below:\n\n|                                            | 2021 Number of shares   | 2020 Number of shares   | 2019 Number of shares   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Outstanding at 1 January                   | 11,371,436              | 11,137,801              | 13,634,518              |\n| Awarded                                    | 7,667,929               | 4,395,633               | 4,538,771               |\n| Vested                                     | (3,425,232)             | (3,240,738)             | (6,041,011)             |\n| Forfeited                                  | (1,295,569)             | (921,260)               | (994,477)               |\n| Outstanding at 31 December                 | 14,318,564              | 11,371,436              | 11,137,801              |\n|                                            | 2021                    | 2020                    | 2019                    |\n| Share award value information              |                         |                         |                         |\n| Fair value per share award during the year | \u20ac47.64                  | \u20ac43.91                  | \u20ac48.22                  |\n\n## Additional information\n\nAt 31 December 2021, shares in PLC totalling 15,370,746 (2020: 12,283,872) were outstanding in respect of share-based compensation plans of PLC and its subsidiaries, including North American plans.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the employee share ownership trust held 4,453,244 (2020: 5,884,511) PLC shares and PLC and its subsidiaries held 847,914 (2020: 1,382,155) PLC shares which are held as treasury shares.",

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nCurrent tax in the consolidated income statement will differ from the income tax paid in the consolidated cash flow statement primarily because of deferred tax arising on temporary differences and payment dates for income tax occurring after the balance sheet date.\n\nUnilever is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates. The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and the government authorities. These matters of judgement give rise to the need to create provisions for tax payments that may arise in future years with respect to transactions already undertaken. Provisions are made against individual exposures and take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice. The provision is estimated based on one of two methods, the expected value method (the sum of the probability weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes) or the single most likely amount method, depending on which is expected to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\n| Tax charge in income statement                                | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Current tax                                                   |                  |                  |                  |\n| Current year                                                  | (2,399)          | (2,128)          | (2,098)          |\n| Over/(under) provided in prior years                          | 245              | (154)            | 119              |\n|                                                               | (2,154)          | (2,282)          | (1,979)          |\n| Deferred tax                                                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences             | 189              | 344              | (255)            |\n| Changes in tax rates                                          | 15               | (19)             | (59)             |\n| Recognition of previously unrecognised losses brought forward | 15               | 34               | 30               |\n|                                                               | 219              | 359              | (284)            |\n|                                                               | (1,935)          | (1,923)          | (2,263)          |\n\nThe reconciliation between the computed weighted average rate of income tax expense, which is generally applicable to Unilever companies, and the actual rate of taxation charged is as follows:\n\n| Reconciliation of effective tax rate                                                | % 2021   | % 2020   | % 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Computed rate of tax (a)                                                            | 24       | 23       | 24       |\n| Differences between computed rate of tax and effective tax rate due to:             |          |          |          |\n| Incentive tax credits                                                               | (2)      | (2)      | (2)      |\n| Withholding tax on dividends                                                        | 2        | 2        | 3        |\n| Expenses not deductible for tax purposes                                            | 1        | 1        | 1        |\n| Irrecoverable withholding tax                                                       | 1        | 1        | 1        |\n| Income tax reserve adjustments - current and prior year                             | (1)      | (1)      | -        |\n| Transfer to/(from) unrecognised deferred tax assets                                 | -        | -        | (2)      |\n| Others                                                                              | (2)      | (1)      | 1        |\n| Underlying effective tax rate                                                       | 23       | 23       | 26       |\n| Taxes related to the UK tax audit of intangible income and centralised services (b) | -        | 1        | -        |\n| Taxes related to the reorganisation of our European business (b)                    | (1)      | 1        | 2        |\n| Hyperinflation adjustment for Argentina deferred tax (b)                            | 1        | -        | -        |\n| Effective tax rate                                                                  | 23       | 25       | 2 8      |\n\nOur tax rate is reduced by incentive tax credits, the benefit from preferential tax regimes that have been legislated by the countries and provinces concerned in order to promote economic development and investment. The tax rate is increased by business expenses which are not deductible for tax, such as entertainment costs and some interest expense and by irrecoverable withholding taxes on dividends paid by subsidiary companies and on other cross-border payments such as royalties and service fees, which cannot be offset against other taxes due. Uncertain tax provisions including the related interest and penalties amounted to \u20ac858 million (2020: \u20ac879 million). In 2020, a provision of \u20ac186 million was established in respect of the tax amortisation of intangible assets, including goodwill, related to Horlicks in India. In 2021, the law was changed to exclude goodwill from the definition of tax depreciable assets effective 1 April 2020. We are therefore now only providing for the amortisation of other intangibles, and our expectation is that we will continue to provide for this until the matter is resolved.\n\nThe Group's future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by several factors, including changes in tax laws and their interpretation, the implementation of the OECD Pillars 1 and 2, EU and US tax changes, as well as the impact of acquisitions, disposals and restructuring of our business.",

Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Group. Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows:\n\n- \u25aa goodwill not deductible for tax purposes;\n- \u25aa differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n- \u25aa the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and\n\nThe amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nAs at\n\n| Movements in 2021 and 2020       | \u20ac million As at

balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of \u20ac4,649 million (2020: \u20ac4,808 million) and tax credits amounting to \u20ac440 million (2020: \u20ac454 million) available for offset against future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of \u20ac4,247 million (2020: \u20ac4,246 million) and tax credits of \u20ac418 million (2020: \u20ac429 million), as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses and credits can be utilised. Of these losses, \u20ac254 million (2020: \u20ac4,195 million) have expiry dates, being corporate income tax losses in the USA, Korea and China which expire between now and 2041. In 2020 the majority of the \u20ac4,195 million figure related to the Netherlands; in 2021 there has been a change in legislation in the Netherlands and losses can now be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nDeferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of other deductible temporary differences of \u20ac1,651 million (2020: \u20ac1,445 million) as it is not expected they will be utilised. Of these differences, \u20ac1,583 million (2020: \u20ac1,193 million) relates to limitation on the deduction of interest expenses. There is no expiry date for these differences.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was \u20ac2,247 million (2020: \u20ac2,097 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the consolidated balance sheet:\n\n| Deferred tax assets and liabilities                                       | \u20ac million Assets  2021   | \u20ac million Assets  2020   | \u20ac million Liabilities   2021   | \u20ac million Liabilities   2020   | \u20ac million Total 2021   | \u20ac million Total 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Pensions and similar obligations                                          | 322                      | 404                      | (976)                          | (324)                          | (654)                  | 80                     |\n| Provisions and accruals                                                   | 426                      | 408                      | 300                            | 290                            | 726                    | 698                    |\n| Goodwill and intangible assets                                            | 453                      | 330                      | (3,901)                        | (3,064)                        | (3,448)                | (2,734)                |\n| Accelerated tax depreciation                                              | (66)                     | (37)                     | (534)                          | (604)                          | (600)                  | (641)                  |\n| Tax losses                                                                | 148                      | 161                      | 24                             | 29                             | 172                    | 190                    |\n| Fair value gains                                                          | (15)                     | (1)                      | (45)                           | (51)                           | (60)                   | (52)                   |\n| Fair value losses                                                         | 5                        | 27                       | (3)                            | 18                             | 2                      | 45                     |\n| Share-based payments                                                      | 38                       | 26                       | 128                            | 120                            | 166                    | 146                    |\n| Lease liability                                                           | 142                      | 157                      | 153                            | 137                            | 295                    | 294                    |\n| Right of use asset                                                        | (119)                    | (128)                    | (125)                          | (116)                          | (244)                  | (244)                  |\n| Other                                                                     | 131                      | 127                      | 449                            | 399                            | 580                    | 526                    |\n|                                                                           | 1,465                    | 1,474                    | (4,530)                        | (3,166)                        | (3,065)                | (1,692)                |\n| Of which deferred tax to be recovered/(settled) after more than 12 months | 1,194                    | 1,230                    | (4,684)                        | (3,311)                        | (3,490)                | (2,081)                |",

Combined earnings per share\n\nThe combined earnings per share calculations are based on the average number of share units representing the combined ordinary shares of NV and PLC in issue during the period, less the average number of shares held as treasury shares.\n\nIn calculating diluted earnings per share and underlying earnings per share, a number of adjustments are made to the number of shares, principally, the exercise of share plans by employees.\n\nUnderlying earnings per share is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity divided by the diluted average number of ordinary shares. In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity, net profit attributable to shareholders' equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items in operating profit and any other significant unusual items within net profit but not operating profit.\n\nEarnings per share for total operations for the 12 months were as follows:\n\n|                               |   \u20ac 2021 |   \u20ac 2020 |   \u20ac 2019 |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Basic earnings per share      |     2.33 |     2.13 |     2.15 |\n| Diluted earnings per share    |     2.32 |     2.12 |     2.14 |\n| Underlying earnings per share |     2.62 |     2.48 |     2.55 |\n\n|                                                                                       | Millions of share units   | Millions of share units   | Millions of share units   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Calculation of average number of share units                                          | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| Average number of shares: PLC                                                         | 2,629.2                   | 1,351.1                   | 1,175.5                   |\n| NV                                                                                    | 0.0                       | 1,278.1                   | 1,598.0                   |\n| Less treasury shares held by employee share trusts and companies                      | (29.3)                    | (8.9)                     | (157.0)                   |\n| Average number of shares - used for basic earnings per share                          | 2,599.9                   | 2,620.3                   | 2,616.5                   |\n| Add dilutive effect of share-based compensation plans                                 | 9.7                       | 9.5                       | 10.2                      |\n| Diluted average number of shares - used for diluted and underlying earnings per share | 2,609.6                   | 2,629.8                   | 2,626.7                   |\n\n\u20ac million\n\n| Calculation of earnings                                                                          | Notes   | 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|------------------|------------------|\n| Net profit                                                                                       |         | 6,621  | 6,073            | 6,026            |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                                        |         | (572)  | (492)            | (401)            |\n| Net profit attributable to shareholders' equity - used for basic and diluted  earnings per share |         | 6,049  | 5,581            | 5,625            |\n| Post-tax impact of non-underlying items                                                          | 3       | 790    | 951              | 1,063            |\n| Underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity - used for underlying  earnings per share |         | 6,839  | 6,532            | 6,688            |",

Total dividends declared in relation to 2021 were \u00a31.46 (2020: \u00a31.48) per PLC ordinary share.\n\n## 9. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business combinations (see note 21). Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less amounts provided for impairment.\n\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is assessed to determine whether new cash generating units are created, and if not, is allocated to the Group's CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. These might not always be the same as the CGUs that include the assets and liabilities of the acquired business. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and is not larger than an operating segment.\n\nThe Group has eleven cash generating units (CGUs) based on the three Divisions by geography and a Health & Wellbeing CGU. In 2021, a new CGU has been recognised following the announcement of the separation of ekaterra.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nSeparately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost, being the purchase price as at the date of acquisition. On acquisition of new interests in group companies, Unilever recognises any specifically identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill. These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.\n\nExpenditure to support development of internally produced intangible assets is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nIndefinite-life intangibles mainly comprise trademarks and brands, for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows. These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support. These assets are not amortised but are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.\n\nFinite-life intangible assets mainly comprise software, patented and non-patented technology, know-how and customer lists. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter. None of the amortisation periods exceed ten years.\n\n|                                             | \u20ac million   | \u20ac million                         | \u20ac million                              | \u20ac million   | \u20ac million   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Movements during 2021                       | Goodwill    | Indefinite-life intangible assets | Finite-life intangible assets Software | Other       | Total       |\n| Cost                                        |             |                                   |                                        |             |             |\n| 1 January 2021                              | 20,118      | 15,420                            | 2,819                                  | 1,074       | 39,431      |\n| Additions through business combinations (a) | 741         | 1,753                             | -                                      | 1           | 2,495       |\n| Disposal of businesses                      | (2)         | -                                 | -                                      | -           | (2)         |\n| Reclassification to held for sale (b)       | (534)       | (362)                             | (7)                                    | -           | (903)       |\n| Additions                                   | -           | -                                 | 229                                    | 2           | 231         |\n| Disposals and other movements               | (18)        | -                                 | (44)                                   | (3)         | (65)        |\n| Hyperinflationary adjustment                | 96          | 7                                 | -                                      | -           | 103         |\n| Currency retranslation                      | 1,088       | 863                               | 192                                    | 40          | 2,183       |\n| 31 December 2021                            | 21,489      | 17,681                            | 3,189                                  | 1,114       | 43,473      |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairment     |             |                                   |                                        |             |             |\n| 1 January 2021                              | (1,176)     | (211)                             | (2,282)                                | (821)       | (4,490)     |\n| Amortisation/impairment for the year        | -           | -                                 | (222)                                  | (52)        | (274)       |\n| Disposals and other movements               | 18          | 1                                 | 48                                     | 2           | 69          |\n| Currency retranslation                      | (1)         | (1)                               | (153)                                  | (32)        | (187)       |\n| 31 December 2021                            | (1,159)     | (211)                             | (2,609)                                | (903)       | (4,882)     |\n| Net book value 31 December 2021 (c)         | 20,330      | 17,470                            | 580                                    | 211         | 38,591      |",

The growth rates and operating margins used to estimate cash flows for the first five years are based on past performance and on the Group's three-year strategic plan, which includes the impact on our business of climate change and activities we are undertaking to reduce carbon emissions, extended to years four and five.\n\nThe estimated cash flows after year five are extrapolated using a longer-term sustainable growth rate, which is determined as the lower of our own three-year average market growth projection and external forecasts for the relevant market.\n\nIn 2021, the projected cash flows are discounted using pre-tax discount rates of between 6.4% and 7.6% (2020: 6.0% and 7.4%). The discount rates are specific to each CGU and are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital, including a market risk premium.\n\nThere are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of a CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n## 10. Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group's property, plant and equipment is comprised of owned assets (note 10A) and leased assets (note 10B). Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost including eligible borrowing costs less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary. If an indication of impairment exists, the asset's or cash generating unit's recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it arises.\n\n## Owned assets\n\nOwned assets are initially measured at historical cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful lives of the assets. Residual values are reviewed at least annually. Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as follows:\n\n- \u25aa freehold buildings (no depreciation on freehold land)\n\n40 years\n\n- \u25aa leasehold land and buildings\n\n40 years (or life of lease if less)\n\n- \u25aa plant and equipment\n- 2-20 years\n\n## Leased assets\n\nThe cost of a leased asset is measured as the lease liability at inception of the lease contract and other direct costs less any incentives granted by the lessor. The Group has not capitalised leases which are less than 12 months or leases of low-value assets. These mainly relate to IT equipment, office equipment, furniture and fitting and other peripheral items. When a lease liability is remeasured, the related lease asset is adjusted by the same amount.\n\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease to the end of the lease term.\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac  million\n\n| Property, plant and equipment   | Notes   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Owned assets                    | 10A     | 8,833  | 8,909  |\n| Leased assets                   | 10B     | 1,514  | 1,649  |\n| Total                           |         | 10,347 | 10,558 |",

The Group leases land and buildings for manufacturing, warehouse facilities and office space and also sublets some property. Plant and equipment includes leases for vehicles.\n\nThe Group has recognised in the income statement, a charge of \u20ac96 million (2020: \u20ac96 million) for short-term leases and \u20ac71 million (2020: \u20ac77 million) on leases for low-value assets.\n\nDuring the year, the Group recognised income of \u20ac16 million (2020: \u20ac19 million) from sublet properties.\n\nThe total cash outflow relating to leases was \u20ac535 million (2020: \u20ac525 million).\n\nLease liabilities are shown in note 15 on pages 144 and 147.\n\n## 11. Other non-current assets\n\nJoint ventures are undertakings in which the Group has an interest and which are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other parties. Associates are undertakings where the Group has an investment in which it does not have control or joint control but can exercise significant influence.\n\nInterests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method and are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost, adjusted for the movement in the Group's share of their net assets and liabilities. The Group's share of the profit or loss after tax of joint ventures and associates is included in the Group's consolidated profit before taxation.\n\nWhere the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in the equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to make payments on behalf of the investee.\n\nBiological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell with any changes recognised in the income statement.",

Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct costs and, where appropriate, a proportion of attributable production overheads. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n| Inventories                         | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Raw materials and consumables       | 1,598            | 1,523            |\n| Finished goods and goods for resale | 3,393            | 3,223            |\n| Total inventories                   | 4,991            | 4,746            |\n| Provision for inventories           | (308)            | (284)            |\n|                                     | 4,683            | 4,462            |\n\n| Provision for inventories   | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 1 January                   | 284              | 288              |\n| Charge to income statement  | 65               | 116              |\n| Reduction/(releases)        | (56)             | (97)             |\n| Currency translations       | 9                | (26)             |\n| Others (a)                  | 6                | 3                |\n| 31 December                 | 308              | 284              |\n\nInventories with a value of \u20ac163 million (2020: \u20ac204 million) are carried at net realisable value, this being lower than cost.

Subsequently these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method and net of any impairment losses. Discounts payable to customers are shown as a reduction in trade receivables when there is a legal right and intent to settle them on a net basis.\n\nWe do not consider the fair values of trade and other current receivables to be significantly different from their carrying values. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Group's customer base being large and diverse. Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. Impairment for trade receivables are calculated for specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery and for balances past due with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant forwardlooking information.\n\n| Trade and other current receivables   | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Due within one year                   |                  |                  |\n| Trade receivables                     | 3,582            | 3,433            |\n| Prepayments and accrued income        | 492              | 423              |\n| Other receivables                     | 1,348            | 1,083            |\n|                                       | 5,422            | 4,939            |\n\nIncluded within trade receivables are discounts due to our customers of \u20ac2,126 million (2020: \u20ac2,082 million).

Trade payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nOther liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent measurement depends on the type of liability:\n\n- \u25aa accruals are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method;\n- \u25aa deferred consideration is subsequently measured at fair value with changes in the income statement as explained below; and\n- \u25aa social security and sundry taxes are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method;\n- \u25aa others are subsequently measured either at amortised cost, using the effective interest method or at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Deferred consideration\n\nDeferred consideration represents any payments to the sellers of a business that occur after the acquisition date. These typically comprise contingent consideration and fixed deferred consideration:\n\n- \u25aa fixed deferred consideration is a payment with a due date after acquisition that is not dependent on future conditions; and\n- \u25aa contingent consideration is a payment which is dependent on certain conditions being met in the future and is often variable.\n\nAll deferred consideration is initially recognised at fair value as at the acquisition date, which includes a present value discount. Subsequently, deferred consideration is measured to reflect the unwinding of discount on the liability, with changes recognised in finance cost within the income statement. In the balance sheet, it is remeasured to reflect the latest estimate of the achievement of the conditions on which the consideration is based; changes in value other than the discount unwind are recognised as acquisition and disposal-related costs within nonunderlying items in the income statement.\n\nWe do not consider the fair values of trade payables and other liabilities to be significantly different from their carrying values.\n\n| Trade payables and other liabilities       | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Current: due within one year               |                  |                  |\n| Trade payables                             | 8,896            | 8,375            |\n| Accruals                                   | 4,429            | 4,266            |\n| Social security and sundry taxes           | 447              | 401              |\n| Deferred consideration                     | 44               | 43               |\n| Others                                     | 1,045            | 1,047            |\n|                                            | 14,861           | 14,132           |\n| Non-current: due after more than one year  |                  |                  |\n| Accruals                                   | 91               | 81               |\n| Deferred consideration                     | 152              | 121              |\n| Others                                     | 32               | 33               |\n|                                            | 275              | 235              |\n| Total trade payables and other liabilities | 15,136           | 14,367           |\n\nIncluded within trade payables and other liabilities are discounts due to our customers of \u20ac1,878 million (2020: \u20ac1,770 million).\n\nIncluded within others are IT and consulting services.\n\n## Deferred consideration\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the total balance of deferred consideration for acquisitions is \u20ac196 million (2020: \u20ac164 million), which includes contingent consideration of \u20ac180 million (2020: \u20ac140 million). These contingent consideration payments are dependent on acquired businesses achieving contractually agreed financial targets (mainly relates to cumulative increases in turnover and profit before tax) and fall due up until 2025, with a maximum contractual amount of \u20ac635 million.\n\n## Supplier financing arrangements for trade payables\n\nSome of our suppliers elect to factor some of their receivables from the Group with financial institutions. In some instances, we provide suppliers and/or banks with visibility of invoices approved for payment, which helps them receive cash from the bank before the invoice due date, if they choose to do so. Payment dates and terms for Unilever do not vary based on whether the supplier chooses to factor their receivable. If a receivable is purchased by a third-party bank, that third-party bank does not benefit from additional security when compared to the security originally enjoyed by the supplier. The Group evaluates these arrangements to assess if the payable holds the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as a financial liability. At 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, all such liabilities were classified as trade payables.",

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nThe Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving awards of ordinary shares. Full details of these plans are given in note 4C on pages 131 and 132.\n\n## Unification reserve\n\nThe Group recognised a separate Unification Reserve within Equity as a result of PLC Share Premium that arose from Unification.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nOther reserves include the fair value reserve, the foreign currency translation reserve, the capital redemption reserve and treasury shares.\n\n## Shares held by employee share trusts and group companies\n\nAn employee share trust and group companies purchase and hold shares to satisfy performance shares granted and other share awards (see note 4C). The assets and liabilities of the trust and shares held by the trust and group companies are included in the consolidated financial statements. The book value of shares held is deducted from other reserves, and the trust's borrowings are included in the Group's liabilities. The costs of the trust are included in the results of the Group. The shares held by the trust and group companies are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, less any directly related transaction costs. When bonds are designated as being part of a fair value hedge relationship, in those cases bonds are carried at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes in value shown in profit and loss. Other financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the exception of:\n\n- \u25aa financial liabilities which the Group has elected to measure at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u25aa contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n- \u25aa derivative financial liabilities - see note 16 on page 149; and\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not yet paid at the start of the lease term. This is discounted using an appropriate borrowing rate determined by the Group, where none is readily available in the lease contract. The lease liability is subsequently reduced by cash payments and increased by interest costs. The lease liability is remeasured when the Group assesses that there will be a change in the amount expected to be paid during the lease term.\n\nThe Group's Treasury activities are designed to:\n\n- \u25aa maintain a competitive balance sheet in line with at least A/A2 rating (see below);\n- \u25aa protect the Group's financial results and position from financial risks (see note 16);\n- \u25aa secure funding at lowest costs for the Group's operations, M&A activity and external dividend payments (see below);\n- \u25aa maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns (see note 16); and\n- \u25aa protect the Group's financial investments, while maximising returns (see note 17).\n\nThe Treasury department provides central deposit-taking, funding and foreign exchange management services for the Group's operations. The department is governed by standards and processes which are approved by Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE). In addition to guidelines and exposure limits, a system of authorities and extensive independent reporting covers all major areas of activity. Performance is monitored closely by senior management. Reviews are undertaken periodically by corporate audit.\n\nKey instruments used by the Treasury department are:\n\n- \u25aa short-term and long-term borrowings;\n- \u25aa plain vanilla derivatives, including cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.\n- \u25aa cash and cash equivalents; and\n\nThe Treasury department maintains a list of approved financial instruments. The use of any new instrument must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer. The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.\n\nUnilever considers the following components of its balance sheet to be managed capital:\n\n- \u25aa total equity - retained profit, other reserves, share capital, share premium, non-controlling interests (notes 15A and 15B);\n- \u25aa long-term debt - non-current financial liabilities (note 15C).\n- \u25aa short-term debt - current financial liabilities (note 15C); and\n\nThe Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group is based on management's judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs. We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.\n\nOur current long-term credit rating is A+/A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1/P1. We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of at least A/A2 in the long term. This provides us with:\n\n- \u25aa appropriate access to the debt and equity markets;\n- \u25aa sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity; and\n- \u25aa sufficient flexibility for acquisitions;\n- \u25aa optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.\n\nUnilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies. This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.",

        "page_content": "## 16. Treasury risk management\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives are measured at fair value with any related transaction costs expensed as incurred. The treatment of changes in the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below.\n\n## (i) Fair value hedges (a)\n\nCertain derivatives are held to hedge the risk of changes in value of a specific bond or other loan. In these situations, the Group designates the liability and related derivative to be part of a fair value hedge relationship. The carrying value of the bond is adjusted by the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes going to the income statement. Gains and losses on the corresponding derivative are also recognised in the income statement. The amounts recognised are offset in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is effective. Ineffectiveness may occur if the critical terms do not exactly match, or if there is a value adjustment resulting from a change in credit risk (in either the Group or the counter-party to the derivative) that is not matched by the hedged item. When the relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.\n\n## (ii) Cash flow hedges (a)\n\nDerivatives are also held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows. Such derivatives are classified as being part of cash flow hedge relationships. For an effective hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in equity. Cost of hedging, where material and opted for, is recorded in a separate account within equity. Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement. Ineffectiveness may occur if there are changes to the expected timing of the hedged transaction. If the hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset. For other cash flow hedges, amounts deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the related cash flow.\n\nWhen a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the related cash flow occurs. When the cash flow takes place, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement. If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement immediately.\n\n## (iii) Net investment hedges (a)\n\nCertain derivatives are designated as hedges of the currency risk on the Group's investment in foreign subsidiaries. The accounting policy for these arrangements is set out in note 1.\n\n## (iv) Derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied\n\nDerivatives not classified as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items and commodity exposures. No hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement.\n\n- (a) Applying hedge accounting has not led to material ineffectiveness being recognised in the income statement for both 2021 and 2020. Fair value changes on basis spread is recorded in a separate account within equity.\n\nThe Group is exposed to the following risks that arise from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections:\n\n- \u25aa liquidity risk (see note 16A);\n- \u25aa credit risk (see note 17B).\n- \u25aa market risk (see note 16B); and\n\nThe Group's risk management framework is established to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to maintain adherence to these limits.\n\n## 16A. Management of liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses. In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions. A material and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine the Group's credit rating, impair investor confidence and also restrict the Group's ability to raise funds.\n\nThe Group's funding strategy was supported by cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from bond issuances. Surplus cash balance has been invested conservatively with low-risk counter-parties at maturities of less than six months. In its liquidity assessment, the Group does not consider any supplier financing arrangements as these arrangements are non-recourse to Unilever and supplier payment dates and terms for Unilever do not vary based on whether the supplier chooses to use such financing arrangements.\n\nCash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financing of financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis. The Group seeks to manage its liquidity requirements by maintaining access to global debt markets through short-term and long-term debt programmes. In addition, Unilever has committed credit facilities for general corporate use.\n\nOn 31 December 2021, Unilever had undrawn revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities in aggregate of $7,965 million (2020: $7,965 million) with a 364-day term out. As part of the regular annual process, the intention is that these facilities will again be renewed in 2022. In December 2021, Unilever signed additional undrawn revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities of \u20ac1,500 million.",

Management of market risk\n\nUnilever's size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u25aa commodity price risk;\n- \u25aa interest rate risk.\n- \u25aa currency risk; and\n\nThe above risks may affect the Group's income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of the Group's management of market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns. Generally, the Group applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.\n\nWhere the Group uses hedge accounting to mitigate the above risks, it is normally implemented centrally by either the Treasury or Commodity Risk Management teams, in line with their respective frameworks and strategies. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship continues to exist between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group generally enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the hedged item, meaning that the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument is evident, so only a qualitative assessment is performed. When a qualitative assessment is not considered sufficient, for example when the critical terms of the hedging instrument do not match exactly with the hedged item, a quantitative assessment of hedge effectiveness will also be performed. The hedge ratio is set on inception for all hedge relationships and is dependent on the alignment of the critical terms of the hedging instrument to the hedged item (in most instances these are matched, so the hedge ratio is 1:1).",

Management of market risk continued\n\nPotential impact of risk\n\n## Currency risk on the Group's net investments\n\nThe Group is also subject to currency risk in relation to the translation of the net investments of its foreign operations into euros for inclusion in its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThese net investments include Group financial loans, which are monetary items that form part of our net investment in foreign operations, of \u20ac9.9 billion (2020: \u20ac9.2 billion), of which \u20ac5.9 billion (2020: \u20ac5.5 billion) is denominated in GBP. In accordance with IAS 21, the exchange differences on these financial loans are booked through reserves.\n\nPart of the currency exposure on the Group's investments is also managed using US$ net investment hedges with a nominal value of \u20ac3.0 billion (2020: \u20ac4.0 billion) for US$.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the net exposure of the net investments in foreign currencies amounts to \u20ac23.6 billion (2020: \u20ac24.6 billion).\n\n(a)\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to market interest rate fluctuations on its floating-rate debt. Increases in benchmark interest rates could increase the interest cost of our floating-rate debt and increase the cost of future borrowings. The Group's ability to manage interest costs also has an impact on reported results.\n\nThe Group does not have any material floating interest-bearing financial assets or any significant long-term fixed interest-bearing financial assets. Consequently, the Group's interest rate risk arises mainly from financial liabilities other than lease liabilities.\n\nTaking into account the impact of interest rate swaps, at 31 December 2021, interest rates were fixed on approximately 75% of the expected financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities) for 2022, and 70% for 2023 (87% for 2021 and 75% for 2022 at 31 December 2020).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had USD 3,300 million (2020: USD 3,700 million) of outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps  (on which cash flow hedge accounting is applied).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had USD 1,350 million (2020: USD 500 million) of outstanding fixed to float interest rate swaps (on which fair value hedge accounting is applied).\n\nFor interest management purposes, transactions with a maturity shorter than six months from inception date are not included as fixed interest transactions.\n\nThe average interest rate on short-term borrowings in 2021 was 0.7% (2020: 1.6%).\n\n## Management policy and hedging strategy\n\nUnilever aims to minimise this currency risk on the Group's net investment exposure by borrowing in local currency in the operating companies themselves. In some locations, however, the Group's ability to do this is inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or by local market conditions.\n\nWhere the residual risk from these countries exceeds prescribed limits, Treasury may decide on a case-by-case basis to actively hedge the exposure. This is done either through additional borrowings in the related currency, or through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.\n\nWhere local currency borrowings, or forward contracts, are used to hedge the currency risk in relation to the Group's net investment in foreign subsidiaries, these relationships are designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nExchange risk related to the principal amount of the US$ denominated debt either forms part of hedging relationship itself, or is hedged through forward contracts.\n\nUnilever's interest rate management approach aims for an optimal balance between fixed and floating-rate interest rate exposures on expected financial liabilities. The objective of this approach is to minimise annual interest costs.\n\nThis is achieved either by issuing fixed or floating-rate long-term debt, or by modifying interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps.\n\nThe majority of the Group's existing interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and are expected to be effective. The fair value movement of these derivatives is recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in the relevant fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability.\n\n## Sensitivity to the risk\n\n## Impact on equity - trade-related cash flow hedges\n\nA 10% strengthening of foreign currencies against the respective functional currencies of group companies hedging future trade cash flows and applying cash flow hedge accounting, would have led to \u20ac113 million loss (2020: \u20ac120 million loss) in equity.\n\nA 10% weakening of the same would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## Impact on equity - net investment hedges\n\nA 10% strengthening of the euro against other currencies would have led to \u20ac303 million (2020: \u20ac404 million) loss in the equity on the net investment hedges used to manage the currency exposure on the Group's investments.\n\nA 10% weakening of the euro against other currencies would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## Impact on equity - net investments in group companies\n\nA 10% strengthening of the euro against all other currencies would have led to \u20ac2,363 million negative retranslation effect (2020: \u20ac2,461 million negative retranslation effect).\n\nA 10% weakening of the euro against all other currencies would have led to an equal but opposite effect. In line with accepted hedge accounting treatment and our accounting policy for financial loans, the retranslation differences would be recognised in equity.\n\n## Impact on income statement\n\nAssuming that all other variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2021 would have led to an additional \u20ac77 million of finance cost (2020: \u20ac40 million additional finance costs).\n\nA 1.0 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on a full-year basis would have an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## Impact on equity - cash flow hedges\n\nAssuming that all other variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2021 would have led to an additional \u20ac3 million credit in equity from derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships (2020: \u20ac11 million credit).\n\nA 1.0 percentage point decrease in interest rates on a full-year basis would have led to an additional \u20ac4 million debit in equity from derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships (2020: \u20ac12 million debit).",

Derivatives and hedging continued\n\n## Master netting or similar agreements\n\nA number of legal entities within our Group enter into derivative transactions under International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counter-party on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances, such as when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.\n\nThe ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting the positive and negative values in the consolidated balance sheet. This is because the Group does not currently having any legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, between various Group and bank affiliates, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future credit events such as a default.\n\nThe column 'Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet - Financial instruments' shows the netting impact of our ISDA agreements, assuming the agreements are respected in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nThe following financial assets are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements.\n\nRelated amounts not set\n\n|                             |                             |                                |                                  | off in the balance sheet   | off in the balance sheet   |            |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n|                             | \u20ac million                   | \u20ac million                      | \u20ac million                        | \u20ac million                  | \u20ac million                  | \u20ac million  |\n|                             |                             | Gross amounts                  |                                  |                            |                            |            |\n|                             | Gross amounts of            | of recognised financial assets | Net amounts of  financial assets |                            | Cash                       |            |\n| As at 31 December 2021      | recognised financial assets | set off in the balance sheet   | presented in the  balance sheet  | Financial  instruments     | collateral received        | Net amount |\n| Derivative financial assets | 401                         | (112)                          | 289                              | (107)                      | (27)                       | 155        |\n| As at 31 December 2020      |                             |                                |                                  |                            |                            |            |\n| Derivative financial assets | 306                         | (148)                          | 158                              | (91)                       | (16)                       | 51         |\n\n## (ii) Financial liabilities\n\nThe following financial liabilities are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements.\n\nRelated amounts not set\n\n|                                  |                                                               |                                                                                             |                                                                                   | off in the balance sheet         | off in the balance sheet            |                      |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2021           | \u20ac million Gross amounts  of recognised financial  liabilities | \u20ac million Gross amounts  of recognised financial  liabilities  set off in the balance sheet | \u20ac million Net amounts  of financial  liabilities  presented in the  balance sheet | \u20ac million Financial  instruments | \u20ac million Cash  collateral received | \u20ac million Net amount |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (347)                                                         | 112                                                                                         | (235)                                                                             | 107                              | -                                   | (128)                |\n| As at 31 December 2020           |                                                               |                                                                                             |                                                                                   |                                  |                                     |                      |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (566)                                                         | 148                                                                                         | (418)                                                                             | 91                               | -                                   | (327)                |",

Investment and return\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet include deposits, investments in money market funds and highly liquid investments. To be classified as cash and cash equivalents, an asset must:\n\n- \u25aa be readily convertible into cash;\n- \u25aa have a maturity period of typically three months or less at acquisition.\n- \u25aa have an insignificant risk of changes in value; and\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement also include bank overdrafts and are recorded at amortised cost.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u25aa those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and\n- \u25aa those to be measured at amortised cost.\n\nThis classification depends on our business model for managing the financial asset and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.\n\nAll financial assets are either debt instruments or equity instruments. Debt instruments are those that provide the Group with a contractual right to receive cash or another asset. Equity instruments are those where the Group has no contractual right to receive cash or another asset.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nThe subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories that debt instruments are classified as:\n\n- \u25aa financial assets at amortised cost;\n- \u25aa financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n- \u25aa financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income; or\n\n## (i) Amortised cost\n\nAssets measured at amortised cost are those which are held to collect contractual cash flows on the repayment of principal or interest (SPPI). A gain or loss on a debt investment recognised at amortised cost on derecognition or impairment is recognised in profit or loss. Interest income is recognised within finance income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## (ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nAssets that are held at fair value through other comprehensive income are those that are held to collect contractual cash flows on the repayment of principal and interest and which are held to recognise a capital gain through the sale of the asset. Movements in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income except for the recognition of impairment, interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## (iii) Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for either amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income are measured as fair value through profit or loss. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Unless they form part of a hedging relationship, these assets are held at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement. Interest income from these assets is included within finance income.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity instruments at fair value. Where the Group has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains or losses to profit or loss. Dividends from these investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nFinancial instruments classified as amortised cost and debt instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are assessed for impairment. The Group assesses the probability of default of an asset at initial recognition and then whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis.\n\nTo assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information. Macroeconomic information (such as market interest rates or growth rates) is also considered.\n\nFinancial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the company. Impairment losses on assets classified as amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss. When a later event causes the impairment losses to decrease, the reduction in impairment loss is also recognised in profit or loss. Permanent impairment losses on debt instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss.",

These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third-party borrowings. We maintain access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short-and long-term debt programmes. We make use of plain vanilla derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to help mitigate risks. More detail is provided in notes 16, 16A, 16B and 16C on pages 149 to 155.\n\nThe remaining \u20ac3 billion (or 89%) of the Group's cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis. For most countries, this is done through dividends which are in some cases subject to withholding or distribution tax. This balance includes \u20ac83 million (2020: \u20ac98 million) of cash that is held in a few countries where we face cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions that inhibit our ability to make these balances available for general use by the wider business. The cash will generally be invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other capital resources available to the Group, does not significantly affect the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.",

        "page_content": "## 17B. Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations. Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 13. These risks are generally managed by local controllers. Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments, including those held at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income, is managed on a Group basis. This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings. Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience. Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by the Group's Treasury department. Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilever's principal counter-parties. In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party. To further reduce the Group's credit exposures on derivative financial instruments, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilever's principal counter-parties in relation to derivative financial instruments. Under these arrangements, counter-parties are required to deposit securities and/or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments. At 31 December 2021, the collateral held by Unilever under such arrangements amounted to \u20ac52 million (2020: \u20ac18 million), of which \u20ac27 million (2020: \u20ac16 million) was in cash, and \u20ac25 million (2020: \u20ac2 million) was in the form of bond securities. The non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in the Group's balance sheet.\n\nFurther details in relation to the Group's exposure to credit risk are shown in note 13 and note 16A.\n\n## 18.

The categories used are as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments;\n- \u25aa Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.\n- \u25aa Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and\n\nFor assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value, the classification of fair value calculations by category is summarised below:\n\n|                                                          | Notes   | \u20ac million Level 1 2021   | \u20ac million Level 1 2020   | \u20ac million Level 2 2021   | \u20ac million Level 2 2020   | \u20ac million Level 3 2021   | \u20ac million Level 3 2020   | \u20ac million Total fair value 2021   | \u20ac million Total fair value 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Assets at fair value                                     |         |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                                   |                                   |\n| Financial assets at fair value  through other            |         |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                                   |                                   |\n| Comprehensive income                                     | 17A     | 6                        | 5                        | 3                        | 3                        | 518                      | 362                      | 527                               | 370                               |\n| Financial assets at fair value  through profit or loss : |         |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                                   |                                   |\n| Derivatives (a)                                          | 16C     | -                        | -                        | 289                      | 158                      | -                        | -                        | 289                               | 158                               |\n| Other                                                    | 17A     | 331                      | 300                      | -                        | -                        | 410                      | 328                      | 741                               | 628                               |\n| Liabilities at fair value                                |         |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                                   |                                   |\n| Derivatives (b)                                          | 16C     | -                        | -                        | (235)                    | (418)                    | -                        | -                        | (235)                             | (418)                             |\n| Contingent consideration                                 | 14      | -                        | -                        | -                        | -                        | (180)                    | (140)                    | (180)                             | (140)                             |\n\n- (a) Includes \u20ac161 million (2020: \u20ac78 million) derivatives, reported within trade receivables, that hedge trading activities.\n- (b) Includes \u20ac(51) million (2020: \u20ac(103) million) derivatives, reported within trade payables, that hedge trading activities.",

Financial instruments fair value risk continued\n\nThere were no significant changes in classification of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities since 31 December 2020. There were also no significant movements between the fair value levels since 31 December 2020.\n\nThe impact in 2021 income statement due to Level 3 instruments is a gain of \u20ac40 million (2020: loss of \u20ac22 million).\n\nReconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities is given below:\n\n| Reconciliation of movements in Level 3 valuations         | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 1 January                                                 | 550              | 373              |\n| Gains and losses recognised in income statement           | 40               | (22)             |\n| Gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income | 190              | 75               |\n| Purchases and new issues                                  | 30               | 41               |\n| Sales and settlements                                     | (62)             | 83               |\n| 31 December                                               | 748              | 550              |\n\n## Significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair values\n\nAssets valued using Level 3 techniques include \u20ac736 million (2020: \u20ac494 million) relating to a number of unlisted investments within Unilever Ventures companies, none of which are individually material; \u20ac115 million (2020: \u20ac106 million) of long-term cash receivables under life insurance policies and \u20ac43 million (2020: \u20ac51 million) for an option over a non-controlling interest. Valuation techniques used are specific to each asset and for all assets a change in one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the value significantly.\n\n## Calculation of fair values\n\nThe fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used in the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\n## Assets and liabilities carried at fair value\n\n- \u25aa The fair values of quoted investments falling into Level 1 are based on current bid prices.\n- \u25aa The fair values of unquoted financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through profit or loss are based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates, discounted cash flow analysis and statistical modelling techniques such as the Monte Carlo simulation. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n- \u25aa Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.\n- \u25aa For listed securities where the market is not liquid, and for unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used. These include the use of recent\n- arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow calculations.\n\n## Other financial assets and liabilities (fair values for disclosure purposes only)\n\n- \u25aa Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables, bank loans and overdrafts, trade payables and other current liabilities have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.\n- \u25aa The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value.\n- \u25aa Non-listed bonds, other loans, bank loans and non-current receivables and payables are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.\n\n## Policies and processes used in relation to the calculation of Level 3 fair values\n\nAssets valued using Level 3 valuation techniques are primarily made up of long-term cash receivables and unlisted investments.

Provisions continued\n\nRestructuring provisions primarily include people costs such as redundancy costs and the cost of compensation where manufacturing, distribution, service or selling agreements are to be terminated. The Group expects these provisions to be substantially utilised within the next few years.\n\nThe Group is involved from time to time in legal and arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, along with other consumer products companies and retail customers, Unilever is involved in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities. These proceedings and investigations are at various stages and concern a variety of product markets. Where specific issues arise, provisions are made to the extent appropriate. Due to the nature of the legal cases, the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.\n\nProvisions for Brazil indirect taxes are comprised of disputes with Brazilian authorities, in particular relating to tax credits that can be taken for the PIS and COFINS indirect taxes. These provisions are separate from the matters listed as contingent liabilities in note 20. Unilever does not have provisions and contingent liabilities for the same matters. Due to the nature of disputed indirect taxes, the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.\n\nOther includes provisions for indirect taxes in countries other than Brazil, interest on tax provisions and provisions for various other matters. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.\n\n## 20. Commitments and contingent liabilities\n\n## Commitments\n\nLease commitments are the future cash outflows from the lease contracts which are not recorded in the measurement of lease liabilities. These include potential future payments related to leases of low-value assets, leases which are less than twelve months, variable leases, extension and termination options and leases not yet commenced but which we have committed to.\n\nOther commitments principally comprise commitments under contract to purchase materials and services. They do not include commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment, which are reported in note 10 on pages 138 to 140.\n\n| Lease commitments and other commitments fall due as follows:   |   \u20ac million Leases 2021 |   \u20ac million Leases 2020 | \u20ac million Other  Commitments 2021   | \u20ac million Other  Commitments (a) 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Within 1 year                                                  |                      56 |                      69 | 1,233                               | 844                                     |\n| Later than 1 year but not later than 5 years                   |                      90 |                      80 | 1,554                               | 694                                     |\n| Later than 5 years                                             |                      23 |                       9 | 501                                 | 18                                      |\n|                                                                |                     169 |                     158 | 3,288                               | 1,556                                   |\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits. It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future. Assessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental, so contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of the known maximum exposure.\n\nContingent liabilities arise in respect of litigations against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation. In many markets, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local tax regimes. The majority of contingent liabilities are in respect of fiscal matters in Brazil.\n\nIn the case of fiscal matters, the known maximum exposure is the amount included in a tax assessment.\n\n| Summary of contingent liabilities                                  | \u20ac million 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Corporate reorganisation - IPI, PIS and COFINS taxes and penalties | 2,549            | 2,040            |\n| Inputs for PIS and COFINS taxes                                    | 36               | 35               |\n| Goodwill amortisation                                              | 137              | 137              |\n| Other tax assessments - approximately 700 cases                    | 749              | 650              |\n| Total Brazil Tax                                                   | 3,471            | 2,862            |\n| Other contingent liabilities                                       | 656              | 648              |\n| Total contingent liabilities                                       | 4,127            | 3,510            |\n\n## Brazil tax\n\nDuring 2004, and in common with many other businesses operating in Brazil, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service in respect of indirect taxes regarding corporate reorganisation. The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without a valid business purpose. The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructuring done by many companies in Brazil. The original dispute was resolved in the courts in the Group's favour. However, in 2013 a new assessment was raised in respect of a similar matter. Additionally, during the course of 2014 and between 2017 and 2022, other notices of infringement were issued based on the same grounds argued in the previous assessments. The total amount of the tax assessments in respect of this matter is \u20ac2,549 million (2020: \u20ac2,040 million).\n\nThe Group believes that the likelihood that the Brazilian tax authorities will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court. In each case we believe our position is strong, so they have not been provided for and are considered to be contingent liabilities. Due to the fiscal environment in Brazil, the possibility of further tax assessments related to the same matters cannot be ruled out. We expect that two of our largest tax litigation cases, which represent around \u20ac904 million of contingent liabilities, will move from the Administrative to the Judicial Courts during 2022, although the exact timing is uncertain. When this happens, we will be required to make a judicial deposit or provide a guarantee in respect of the disputed tax, interest and penalties. The judicial process in Brazil is likely to take a number of years to conclude.",

Unilever does not hold provisions and contingent liabilities for the same matters.\n\n## 21. Acquisitions and disposals\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group.\n\nGoodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interests less the net recognised amount (which is generally fair value) of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment (or more frequently if necessary) in accordance with our accounting policies. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises. Detailed information relating to goodwill is provided in note 9 on pages 136 to 138.\n\nTransaction costs are expensed as incurred, within non-underlying items.\n\nChanges in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions and therefore do not have any impact on goodwill. The difference between consideration and the non-controlling share of net assets acquired is recognised within equity.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, the Group completed the business acquisitions and disposals as listed below. 100% of the businesses were acquired unless stated otherwise. Total consideration for 2021 acquisitions is \u20ac2,117 million (2020: \u20ac6,337 million for acquisitions completed during that year). In November 2021, Unilever announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its global tea business with disposal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022. Further details can be found in Note 22.\n\n| Deal completion date   | Acquired business                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 29 January 2021        | Acquired 51% of Welly Health, a producer of bandages and other healthcare-related items.

The total consideration paid was \u20ac1,832 million which comprised of \u20ac1,818 million cash paid on the completion date and \u20ac14 million of deferred consideration. The provisional fair value of net assets recognised on the balance sheet is \u20ac1,223 million. Currently all balances remain provisional as we finalise our review of the asset valuations. The main assets acquired were brands which were valued using an income approach model by estimating future cash flows generated by the brand and discounting them to present value using rates in line with a market participant expectation. As part of the acquisition, goodwill of \u20ac609 million has been recognised and which is not deductible for tax purposes. Since the acquisition date, the goodwill balance has increased by \u20ac37 million as a result of foreign exchange effects.\n\nMore information related to each major class of assets and liabilities acquired is provided on page 162.\n\n## Effect on consolidated income statement\n\nThe acquisition deals completed in 2021 have contributed \u20ac196 million to Group turnover and \u20ac16 million to Group operating profit since the date of acquisition. If the acquisition deals completed in 2021 had all taken place at the beginning of the year, Group turnover would have been \u20ac52,637 million, and Group operating profit would have been \u20ac8,738 million. In 2020, the impact of acquisitions completed in the year was \u20ac476 million to Group turnover and \u20ac124 million to Group operating profit. If all of the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of 2020, Group turnover for 2020 would have been \u20ac51,116 million and Group operating profit would have been \u20ac8,371 million.\n\n## 2020\n\nIn 2020 the Group completed the business acquisitions and disposals listed below. In each case (unless otherwise stated), 100% of the businesses were acquired. For all businesses acquired, the acquisition accounting has been finalised. Subsequent changes to the provisional numbers published last year are immaterial.",

Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and groups of assets and liabilities which comprise disposal groups are classified as 'held for sale' when all of the following criteria are met: a decision has been made to sell; the assets are available for sale immediately; the assets are being actively marketed; and a sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nImmediately prior to classification as held for sale, the non-current assets or groups of assets are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Subsequently, non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are valued at the lower of book value or fair value less disposal costs. Assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised.\n\nNon-current assets and liabilities held for sale are recognised as current on the balance sheet.\n\nIn November 2021, Unilever announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its global Tea business, ekaterra, to CVC Capital Partners Fund VIII for \u20ac4.5 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis with completion expected in the second half of 2022.\n\nAs a result, the assets and liabilities are held for sale as at 31 December 2021. ekaterra includes brands such as PG tips, Pukka, Tazo, Lipton and T2, with 11 production factories across 4 continents and tea estates in 3 countries.\n\nekaterra excludes Unilever's Tea business in India, Nepal and Indonesia as well as Unilever's interests in the Pepsi Lipton ready-to-drink Tea joint ventures and associated distribution businesses. ekaterra forms part of the Foods and Refreshment segment across AAR, Europe and Americas.",

Otherwise, events after the balance sheet date of a material size or nature are disclosed below.\n\n## Dividend\n\nOn 10 February 2022, Unilever announced a quarterly dividend with the 2021 fourth-quarter results of \u00a30.3602 per PLC ordinary share. The total value of the announced dividend is \u20ac1,137 million.\n\n## Organisational model\n\nOn 25 January 2022, Unilever announced changes to its organisational model to make it simpler and more category focused. The company will move away from its current matrix structure and will be organised around five distinct Business Groups: Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care, Nutrition, and Ice Cream. Each Business Group will be fully responsible and accountable for their strategy, growth, and profit delivery globally. We expect the new structure to be fully operational from the middle of the year. All costs related to setting up the new organisation will be managed within the existing restructuring investment plans of \u20ac2 billion across 2021 and 2022.\n\n## Debt issuance\n\nOn 23 February 2022, Unilever issued \u00a3300 million 2.125% notes maturing in 2028, \u20ac500 million 0.75% notes maturing in 2026 and \u20ac650 million 1.25% notes maturing in 2031.",

The Company accounts comply with Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as 'fair value through other comprehensive income' or 'fair value through profit or loss', as well as derivative financial instruments, which are reported in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.\n\nUnilever PLC is included within the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies of PLC Company Accounts are the same as the Unilever Group, refer to pages 118 and 119, except for the accounting policies included below.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nThe Company's functional and presentational currency is pound sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company's functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Turnover\n\nTurnover excludes value added tax and includes royalties and service fees received from group companies. Royalty income from brand and technology licence arrangements is recognised at the time sales are made by group companies. Revenue from services is recognised over time based on the usage of these services by group companies.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nThe operating profit is stated after deducting the costs that are mainly related to the royalties and delivered services. Expenses are allocated to the period in which they relate.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\nShares in group companies are stated at cost less any amounts written off to reflect an impairment.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nWhere PLC enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, they consider these to be insurance arrangements and account for them as such. In this respect, PLC treats the guarantee contracts as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that it will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' has been released but is not yet adopted by the Company. The standard is effective from the year ended 31 December 2023 and introduces a new model for accounting for insurance contracts. We are currently assessing the impact of this new standard on this accounting policy.\n\n## Capital Redemption Reserve\n\nThe nominal value of shares cancelled is transferred from share capital to the capital redemption reserve.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and judgements are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected.\n\nThe following judgements and estimates are what management believe have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the PLC Company Accounts as indicated below:\n\nOn 1 January 2021, a swap transaction of intellectual property rights occurred between PLC, Unilever Global IP Limited and Unilever IP Holdings B.V. (IP Swap) where :\n\n- \u25aa PLC transferred its intellectual property related to Foods and Refreshment to Unilever IP Holdings B.V. and in exchange received intellectual property related to Home Care and Beauty and Personal Care (HC BPC). Accordingly, PLC derecognised \u00a3139 million of intangible assets, recognised the acquired intellectual property at a fair value of \u00a32,954 million and an unrealised gain in the income statement of \u00a32,815 million for the difference. A deferred tax charge of \u00a3702 million was also recognised.\n- \u25aa PLC then transferred the intellectual property related to HC and BPC to Unilever Global IP Limited. For this transfer, PLC derecognised the intangible assets of \u00a32,961 million and deferred tax liability of \u00a3702 million with a corresponding increase in the investment in Unilever Global IP Limited for the net amount.\n\nThe IP swap had economic substance and therefore the acquired intellectual property is recognised at fair value. Management used judgement to estimate the fair value and employed the Relief from Royalty method. The key assumptions included revenue growth, remaining useful life, arm's length royalty rate and discount rate.\n\n## 1. Turnover\n\n\u00a3 million\n\n\u00a3 million\n\n|                           |   2021 | 2020   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Royalties (point in time) |    111 | 562    |\n| Services (over time)      |    285 | 1,719  |\n| Turnover                  |    396 | 2,281  |\n\nThe significant reduction in turnover in 2021 is due to the transfer of intellectual property to subsidiaries (including the swap transaction described in note 4) which has resulted in reduced royalty income. In addition, the ongoing transfer of service contracts to other group companies has resulted in a decline in service turnover.\n\n## 2.

Accordingly, PLC derecognised \u00a3139 million of intangible assets and recognised the acquired intellectual property at a fair value of \u00a32,954 million which was then transferred to Unilever Global IP Limited, along with the remainder intellectual property in PLC's books. For this transfer, PLC has derecognised intangible assets of \u00a32,961 million and deferred tax liability of \u00a3702 million and increased the investment in Unilever Global IP Limited by the net amount of \u00a32,259 million.",

See note 4 for more details.\n\nInvestments include the subsidiary company Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), with a cost of \u00a32,197 million (2020: \u00a32,197 million). The shares of HUL are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and have a market value of \u00a326,195 million (2020: \u00a326,789 million) as at 31 December 2021. Information on the non-controlling interest in HUL is given in note 15B of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries comprise equity shares of group companies. These investments only generate cash inflows in combination with other assets within the group. Accordingly cash inflows are not independent at any level below the cash generating units (CGUs) used for group impairment testing purposes. There have been no impairments recorded against the group CGUs at the end of the reporting periods and therefore there is no indication that any of the investments in subsidiaries would be subject to impairment.\n\n## 6.

As these are amounts due from other entities within the Group, PLC has estimated the expected credit losses to be immaterial. Our historical experience of collecting these balances supported by the level of default confirms that the credit risk is low.\n\n## 7.

The Company entered into derivatives to mitigate the foreign currency risk but does not apply hedge accounting.\n\nCurrency sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below details the company's sensitivity to a 10% increase (2020: 10% increase) in the pound sterling against the foreign currencies. These percentages represent management's assessment of the possible changes in the foreign exchange rates at the respective year-ends. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period-end for the above percentage change in foreign currency rates.\n\nA 10% strengthening of the foreign currencies against the pound sterling would have led to approximately an additional \u00a35 million gain in the income statement (2020: \u00a318 million gain).\n\nA 10% weakening of the foreign currencies against the pound sterling would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\nInterest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks on its intercompany loans receivable, intercompany loans payable and commercial papers as these are floating. Increases in benchmark interest rates could increase the interest income and interest cost. The intercompany loans receivables and loans payables were initially recognised at their fair value. The fair value of these assets is the same as their carrying amount at 31 December 2021.\n\nInterest rate sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the statement of financial position date.\n\nThe following changes in the interest rates represent management's assessment of the possible change in interest rates at the respective year-ends:\n\nAssuming that all variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2021 would have led to an additional \u00a312 million of finance cost (2020: \u00a330 million additional finance cost).\n\nA 1.0 percentage point decrease in floating interest rate on a full-year basis would have an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## 12. Transactions with related parties\n\nA related party is a person or entity that is related to PLC. These include both people and entities that have, or are subject to, the influence or control of PLC. Information on key management personnel has been given in note 23 of the consolidated financial statements.",

Contingent liabilities and financial commitments\n\nThe total amount of guarantees is \u00a330,942 million (2020: \u00a330,374 million).\n\nThis consists of guarantees relating to:\n\n- \u25aa The long-term debt and commercial paper issued by Group companies such as Unilever Finance Netherlands B.V. and Unilever Capital Corporation, which are joint with Unilever United States, Inc.\n- \u25aa Group companies obligations to the UK and Netherlands pension funds and of the Group captive insurance company; and\n- \u25aa Certain borrowings and derivatives of the other group companies.\n\nThere are also certain financial commitments which are not included in the total amount of guarantees because they do not currently relate to existing liabilities or cannot be quantified:\n\n- \u25aa PLC and Unilever United States, Inc. have guaranteed the standby facilities of $7,965 million (2020: $7,965 million) and \u20ac1,500 million (2020: Nil) for the group companies which were undrawn as at 31 December 2021 and 2020;\n- \u25aa The joint and several liability undertakings issued by NV in accordance with Article 2:403 of the Dutch Civil Code for almost all of its Dutch group companies were withdrawn by means of filings with the Dutch Trade Register on 27 November 2020, being the last practicable date prior to the effective date of the cross-border merger between NV and PLC. With effect from the date of the crossborder merger, PLC issued a guarantee confirming PLC's liability for any residual liability referred to in Article 2:404 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code of NV remaining after the withdrawal of such undertakings, to the extent that such liability did not transfer in the cross-border merger; and\n- \u25aa PLC has guaranteed some contingent consideration of Group companies relating to past business acquisitions and financial commitments including indemnities arising from past business disposals; and certain global and regional contracts\n\nThe likelihood of all of these guarantees and financial commitments being called upon is considered to be remote and so the fair value is deemed to be immaterial.\n\n## 14. Remuneration of auditors\n\nThe parent company accounts of Unilever PLC are required to comply with the Companies (Disclosure of Auditor Remuneration and Liability Limitation Agreements) Regulations 2008. For details of the remuneration of the auditors, please refer to note 25 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 15. Remuneration of Directors\n\nInformation about the remuneration of Directors is given in the tables noted as audited in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 104. Information on key management compensation is provided in note 4A to the consolidated financial statements on page 125.\n\n## 16. Post-balance sheet events\n\n## Dividend\n\nOn 10 February 2022 the Directors announced a dividend of \u00a30.3602 per PLC ordinary share. Dividends will be paid out of retained profit. The dividend is payable on 22 March 2022 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 25 February 2022.\n\n## Debt issuance\n\nOn 23 February 2022, Unilever PLC issued \u00a3300 million 2.125% notes maturing in 2028.",

        "page_content": "## Directors, senior management and employees\n\n## Employees\n\nThe average number of employees for the last three years is provided in note 4A on page 125. The average number of employees during 2021 included 7,837 seasonal workers. We believe our relationship with our employees and any labour unions of which they may be part is satisfactory in all material respects.\n\n## Global employee share plans (shares)\n\nIn November 2014, Unilever's global employee plan 'SHARES' was launched in 17 countries. SHARES gives eligible Unilever employees below management level the opportunity to invest between \u20ac10 and \u20ac200 per month from their net salary in Unilever shares. For every three shares our employees buy (Investment Shares), Unilever will give them one free Matching Share, which will vest if employees hold their Investment Shares for at least three years. The Matching Shares are not subject to any performance conditions. In 2015, SHARES was rolled out globally and is now offered in more than 100 countries. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in SHARES. As of 24 February 2022 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), awards for 385,489 PLC shares were outstanding under SHARES.\n\n## North American share plans\n\nUnilever also maintains share plans for its North American employees that are governed by an umbrella plan referred to as the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, which was amended and restated as of 2 February 2021 to make appropriate changes in light of Unification. These plans are the North American equivalents of the Unilever Share Plan 2017 and SHARES plans, as amended from time to time. The rules governing these share plans are materially the same as the rules governing the Unilever Share Plan 2017 and SHARES plans, respectively. However, the plans contain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants and they are subject to US and Canadian employment and tax laws. The plans are administered by the North America Compensation Committee of Unilever United States, Inc. and they are governed by New York law.\n\nThe foregoing description of the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, including all amendments thereto, filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form S-8 (File No. 333-185299) filed with the SEC on 6 December 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\nThe Committee is concerned with the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the tier of management directly below the Board. The Committee also has responsibility for the cash and executive and all-employee share-based incentive plans, the Remuneration Policy and performance evaluation of the Unilever Leadership Executive and the periodic review of the remuneration and related policies of the wider workforce to assess alignment to PLC's purpose, value and strategy.\n\n## Directors and senior management\n\n## Family relationship\n\nThere are no family relationships between any of our Executive Directors, members of the ULE or Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Other arrangements\n\nNone of our Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors or other key management personnel are elected or appointed under any arrangement or understanding with any major shareholder, customer, supplier or others.",

        "page_content": "## Major shareholders and related party transactions\n\n## Major shareholders\n\nThe voting rights of the significant shareholders of PLC are the same as for other holders of the class of share held by such significant shareholder.\n\nThe principal trading market upon which PLC ordinary shares are listed is the London Stock Exchange. PLC ordinary shares are also listed and traded on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nIn the United States, PLC American Depositary Receipts are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank) acts for PLC as depositary.\n\nAt 24 February 2022 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), there were 2,035 registered holders of PLC American Depositary Receipts in the United States. We estimate that approximately 12% of PLC's ordinary shares (including shares underlying PLC American Depositary Receipts) were held in the United States (approximately 11% in 2020).\n\nIf you are a shareholder of PLC, your interest is in a UK legal entity, your dividends will be paid in pound sterling (converted into US dollars if you have American Depositary Receipts) and you may be subject to UK tax.\n\nTo Unilever's knowledge, PLC is not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by another corporation, any foreign government or by any other legal or natural person, severally or jointly. PLC is not aware of any arrangements the operation of which may at any subsequent date result in a change of control of PLC.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nTransactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with agreed transfer pricing policies and include sales to joint ventures and associates. Other than those disclosed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements (and incorporated herein as above), there were no related party transactions that were material to the Group or to the related parties concerned that are required to be reported in 2021 up to 24 February 2022 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report).\n\n## Dividend record\n\nThe following tables show the dividends declared and dividends paid by PLC for the last five years, expressed in terms of the revised share denominations which became effective from 22 May 2006.\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n| Dividends declared for the year     |       |       |       |       |       |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| PLC dividends                       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Dividend per 3 1 /9 p               | \u00a31.46 | \u00a31.48 | \u00a31.43 | \u00a31.35 | \u00a31.26 |\n| Dividend per 3 1 /9 p (US Registry) | $2.00 | $1.91 | $1.83 | $1.82 | $1.66 |\n| Dividends paid during the year      |       |       |       |       |       |\n| PLC dividends                       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Dividend per 3 1 /9 p               | \u00a31.48 | \u00a31.45 | \u00a31.42 | \u00a31.33 | \u00a31.22 |\n| Dividend per 3 1 /9 p (US Registry) | $2.03 | $1.85 | $1.82 | $1.83 | $1.56 |",

Similarly, other than certain economic sanctions which may be in force from time to time, there are no limitations relating only to non-residents of the UK under English law or the PLC's Articles of Association on the right to be a holder of, and to vote in respect of, the company's shares.\n\n## Unilever Annual Report on Form 20-F 2021\n\nFiled with the SEC on the SEC's website. Printed copies are available, free of charge, upon request to Unilever PLC, Investor Relations department, 100 Victoria Embankment, London, EC4Y 0DY United Kingdom.\n\n## Documents on display in the United States\n\nUnilever files and furnishes reports and information with the United States SEC. Certain of our reports and other information that we file or furnish to the SEC are also available to the public over the internet on the SEC's website.\n\n## Other information on the Company\n\n## Innovation, Research and Development\n\nWe have over 20,000 patents protecting the ideas, discoveries and breakthroughs that our global team of 5,000 world-leading experts produce. We invest around \u20ac1 billion in R&D each year.\n\nTechnology sits at the heart of our approach to innovation. We are building automated technology into our innovation centres. Our UK Materials Innovation Factory has the highest concentration of robots doing material chemistry work in the world. It delivers data ten times faster than traditional methods. We run virtual tests and scenarios to optimise products before the lab stage, thereby innovating sooner and cutting time to market - in one year we can perform 12,000 rapid product tests. Shanghai, China is home to our AI Hub where we use insights from real time data to prototype innovations and test them via eCommerce in just a matter of days. Fast, efficient, effective innovating.\n\nResearch and development is powering our move away from petrochemicals, stopping plastic pollution, in collaboration with our partners. Our goal is to make a Clean Future. One of the ways we will do this is by replacing 100% of the carbon derived from fossil fuels in our Home Care products with renewable or recycled carbon.\n\nInnovation in biology unlocks significant benefits and will be a driver in achieving our climate and nature goals. We are a world leader in the microbiome space and have more than 100 patents in this area alone. We are exploring its influence on all aspects of health and wellbeing. We are also deepening our understanding of the skin and innovating accordingly. One example of this is a new pro-lipids technology that helps the skin to repair its barrier from the inside out.\n\nEvery Unilever product is based on an innovation crafted by our experts in collaboration with our network of partners. We translate our scientific discoveries into everyday products that care for the planet and improve people's health, confidence and wellbeing. Some of our focus areas are hygiene, skin care, prestige beauty, plant-based foods and functional nutrition, such as vitamins, minerals and supplements, and we're constantly evolving alongside our consumers' ever-changing lives and tastes.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nOur products use a wide variety of raw and packaging materials which we source locally and internationally, and which may be subject to price volatility either directly or as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nIn 2021, we witnessed broad-based inflation across commodities as global demand recovering from the pandemic and exacerbated by persistent production and logistical disruptions particularly during the second and third wave of the pandemic. Weakening currencies in many emerging markets, such as Turkey, Argentina, and Brazil, meant further challenges.\n\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect continued volatility in commodity markets. We remain watchful of the impact of Covid, supply stabilisation and how the global economy recovers in the new normal.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nCertain of our businesses, such as ice cream, are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in sales. However, Unilever operates globally in many different markets and product categories, and no individual element of seasonality is likely to be material to the results of the Group as a whole.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe have a large portfolio of patents and trademarks, and we conduct some of our operations under licences that are based on patents or trademarks owned or controlled by others. We are not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We use all appropriate efforts to protect our brands and technology.\n\n## Competition\n\nAs a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, we are competing with a diverse set of competitors. Some of these operate on an international scale like ourselves, while others have a more regional or local focus. Our business model centres on building brands which consumers know, trust, like and buy in conscious preference to those of our competitors. Our brands command loyalty and affinity and deliver superior performance.\n\n## Information on market share\n\nUnless otherwise stated, market share refers to value share as opposed to volume share. The market data and competitive position classifications are taken from independent industry sources in the markets in which Unilever operates.\n\n## Iran-related required disclosure\n\nUnilever operates in Iran through a non-US subsidiary. In 2021, sales in Iran were less than one per cent of Unilever's worldwide turnover. During the year, this non-US subsidiary had approximately \u20ac2,375,543 in gross revenues and less than \u20ac1,021,483 in net profits attributable to the sale of food, personal care and home care products to entities affiliated with the Government of Iran. These entities were the Shahrvand Group, which is owned by the municipality of Tehran and Refah, which is a chain of 200 state-owned department stores. This non-US subsidiary has donated a de minimus amount of personal care products to Firoozgar Hospital, which is a hospital affiliated with goverment, to assist with the Covid-19 pandemic. Income, payroll and other taxes, duties and fees (including for utilities) were payable to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities in connection with our operations. Our non-US subsidiary maintains bank accounts in Iran with various banks to facilitate our business in the country and make any required payments to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities. While we currently continue our activities in Iran, we are continuously evaluating such activities in light of the evolving regulatory environment.",

        "page_content": "## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group has interests in properties in most of the countries where there are Unilever operations. None of these interests are individually material in the context of the Group as a whole. The properties are used predominantly to house production and distribution activities and as offices. There is a mixture of leased and owned property throughout the Group. We are not aware of any environmental issues affecting the properties which would have a material impact upon the Group, and there are no material encumbrances on our properties. Any difference between the market value of properties held by the Group and the amount at which they are included in the balance sheet is not significant. We believe our existing facilities are satisfactory for our current business and we currently have no plans to construct new facilities or expand or improve our current facilities in a manner that is material to the Group.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe comments below in relation to United Kingdom and United States taxation are based on current United Kingdom and United States federal income tax law as applied in England and Wales and the United States respectively, and HM Revenue & Customs ('HMRC') and Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') practice (which may not be binding on HMRC or the IRS) respectively, in each case as at the latest practicable date before the date of this document.\n\n## Taxation for US persons holding shares or American Depositary Shares in PLC\n\nThe following notes are provided for guidance. US persons should consult their local tax advisers, particularly in connection with potential liability to pay US taxes on disposal, lifetime gift or bequest of their shares or American Depositary Shares ('ADSs'). A US person is a US individual citizen or resident, a corporation organised under the laws of the United States, any state or the District of Columbia, or any other legal person subject to US Federal Income Tax on its worldwide income.\n\n## United Kingdom taxation on dividends\n\nUnder United Kingdom law, income tax is not withheld from dividends paid by most United Kingdom companies, including PLC. Shareholders of PLC, whether resident in the United Kingdom or not, receive the full amount of the dividend actually declared.\n\nA non-UK resident shareholder or ADS holder holding their shares or ADSs otherwise than in connection with any trade, profession or vocation carried on through a branch, agency or permanent establishment in the UK will not generally be subject to UK tax in respect of dividends paid by PLC.\n\n## United States taxation on dividends\n\nIf you are a US person, the distribution up to the amount of PLC's earnings and profits for US Federal Income Tax purposes will be ordinary dividend income.\n\nAny portion of the distribution that exceeds PLC's earnings and profits is subject to different rules. This portion is a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in PLC's shares or ADSs, and thereafter is treated as a gain on a disposition of the shares or ADSs. PLC does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with US Federal Income Tax accounting principles. You should therefore assume that any distribution by PLC with respect to the shares will be reported as ordinary dividend income. You should consult your own tax advisers with respect to the appropriate US Federal Income Tax treatment of any distribution received from us.\n\nDividends received by an individual will be taxed at a maximum rate of 15% or 20%, depending on the income level of the individual, provided the individual has held the shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date, that PLC is a qualified foreign corporation and certain other conditions are satisfied. PLC is a qualified foreign corporation for this purpose. In addition, an additional tax of 3.8% will apply to dividends and other investment income received by individuals with incomes exceeding certain thresholds. The dividend is not eligible for the dividends received deduction allowable to corporations. The dividend is foreign source income for US foreign tax credit purposes.\n\nFor US Federal Income Tax purposes, the amount of any dividend paid in a non-US currency will be included in income in a US dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividends are received by you or the depositary (in the case of ADSs), regardless of whether they are converted into US dollars at that time. If the non-US currency is converted into US dollars on the day they are received, you generally will not be required to recognise foreign currency gain or loss in respect of this dividend income.\n\n## UK taxation on capital gains\n\nUnder United Kingdom law, when you dispose of shares or ADSs you may be liable to pay United Kingdom tax in respect of any gain accruing on the disposal.\n\nHowever, if you are either:\n\n- \u25aa an individual who is not resident in the United Kingdom for the year in question; or\n- \u25aa a company which is not resident in the United Kingdom when the gain accrues\n\nyou will generally not be liable to United Kingdom tax on any gains made on disposal of your shares or ADSs.\n\nThere are exceptions to this general rule, two of which are: if the shares or ADSs are held in connection with a trade or business which is conducted in the United Kingdom through a branch, agency or permanent establishment; or if the shares or ADSs are held by an individual who becomes resident in the UK having left the UK for a period of non-residence of five years or less and who was resident for at least four of the seven tax years prior to leaving the UK. In such cases, you may be liable to United Kingdom tax in respect of the disposal of shares or ADSs.\n\n## United States taxation on capital gains\n\nA US person generally will recognise capital gain or loss for US Federal Income Tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realised on the sale and the US person's adjusted tax basis in the shares or ADSs, in each case as determined in US dollars. US persons should consult their own tax advisers about how to determine the US dollar value of any foreign currency received as proceeds on the sale of shares or ADSs and the treatment of any foreign currency gain or loss upon conversion of the foreign currency into US dollars. The capital gain or loss recognised on the sale will be long-term capital gain or loss if the US person's holding period in the shares or ADSs exceeds one year. Non-corporate US persons are subject to tax on long-term capital gain at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nUnder the current estate and gift tax convention between the United States and the United Kingdom, shares or ADSs (regardless of whether they are situated in the United Kingdom for inheritance tax purposes) held by an individual shareholder who is:\n\n- \u25aa domiciled for the purposes of the convention in the United States; and\n- \u25aa not for the purposes of the convention a national of the United Kingdom\n\nwill generally not be subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax:\n\n- \u25aa on the individual's death; or\n- \u25aa on a gift of the shares during the individual's lifetime.\n\nWhere shares or ADSs are held on trust, they will generally not be subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax where the settlor at the time of the settlement:\n\n- \u25aa was domiciled for the purposes of the convention in the United States; and\n- \u25aa was not for the purposes of the convention a national of the United Kingdom.\n\nAn exception is if the shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the shareholder in the United Kingdom or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a fixed base situated in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhere shares or ADSs are subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax and United States federal gift or federal estate tax, the amount of the tax paid in one jurisdiction can generally be credited against the tax due in the other jurisdiction.",

        "page_content": "Where a United Kingdom inheritance tax liability is prima facie not payable by virtue of the convention, that tax can become payable if any applicable federal gift or federal estate tax on the shares or ADSs in the United States is not paid.\n\nWhere shares are dealt with through a clearing system or in the form of ADSs, the situs of the shares may not be determinative of the situs of the interests held by holders through such system or of such ADSs for United Kingdom inheritance tax purposes. Where shares are dealt with through Euroclear Nederland, there are arguments that the interests of participants in Euroclear Nederland will be situated outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of United Kingdom inheritance tax so long as Euroclear Nederland maintains the book-entry register of such participants' interests outside the United Kingdom, although HMRC may not accept this analysis. Similarly, there are arguments that ADSs registered on a register outside the United Kingdom will be situated outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of United Kingdom inheritance tax, although again HMRC may not accept this analysis. Shareholders to whom this may be relevant should consult an appropriate professional adviser.\n\nIf the ADSs or the shares dealt with through Euroclear Nederland or both are not situated in the United Kingdom, a gift of such ADSs or such shares by, or the death of, an individual holder of such assets who is neither domiciled nor deemed to be domiciled (under certain rules relating to long residence or previous domicile) in the United Kingdom will not generally give rise to a liability to United Kingdom inheritance tax regardless of whether the estate and gift tax convention between the United States and the United Kingdom applies. Special rules may also apply to such ADSs or such shares dealt with through Euroclear Nederland which are held on trust.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nThe statements in this section are intended as a general guide to the current United Kingdom stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax ('SDRT') position. Special rules apply to certain transactions such as transfers of the shares to a company connected with the transferor and those rules are not described below. Investors should also note that certain categories of person are not liable to stamp duty or SDRT and others may be liable at a higher rate or may, although not primarily liable for tax, be required to notify and account for SDRT under the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax Regulations 1986.\n\n## Backup withholding and information reporting\n\nPayments of dividends and other proceeds with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs by US persons will be reported to you and to the IRS as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if you fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fail to comply with applicable certification requirements. Some holders are not subject to backup withholding. You should consult your tax adviser as to your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption.\n\n## Disclosure requirements for US individual holders\n\nUS individuals that hold certain specified non-US financial assets, including stock in a non-US corporation, with values in excess of certain thresholds are required to file Form 8938 with their US Federal Income Tax return. Such Form requires disclosure of information concerning such non-US assets, including the value of the assets. Failure to file the Form when required is subject to penalties. An exemption from reporting applies to non-US assets held through a US financial institution generally including a non-US branch or subsidiary of a US institution and a US branch of a non-US institution. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisers regarding the possible application of this disclosure requirement to their investment in the shares or ADSs.\n\n## Issue of shares\n\nSubject to the points noted below in respect of shares issued to clearance services (such as Euroclear Nederland) or which are issued into a depositary receipt system where the shares are to be held in ADS form, no stamp duty or SDRT will arise on the issue of shares in registered form by PLC.\n\n## Transfer of shares\n\nExcept in relation to clearance services and depositary receipt systems (to which special rules outlined below apply), stamp duty at the rate of 0.5 per cent (rounded up to the next multiple of \u00a35) of the amount or value of the consideration given will generally be payable on an instrument transferring PLC shares. A charge to SDRT will also generally arise on an unconditional agreement to transfer PLC shares (at the rate of 0.5 per cent of the amount or value of the consideration payable). However, if within six years of the date of the agreement becoming unconditional, an instrument of transfer is executed pursuant to the agreement, and stamp duty is paid on that instrument, any SDRT already paid will be refunded (generally, but not necessarily, with interest) provided that a claim for repayment is made, and any outstanding liability to SDRT will be cancelled. The liability to pay stamp duty or SDRT is generally satisfied by the purchaser or transferee.\n\n## Shares held through clearance services including Euroclear Nederland\n\nSpecial rules apply where shares are issued or transferred to, or to a nominee or agent for, a person providing a clearance service. In such circumstances, SDRT or stamp duty may be charged at a rate of 1.5 per cent, with subsequent transfers within the clearance service then being free from SDRT and stamp duty (except in relation to clearance service providers that have made an election under section 97A(1) of the Finance Act 1986 which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs, to which the special rules apply).\n\nIn light of EU case law, HMRC accepted that the 1.5 per cent charge is in breach of EU law so far as it applies to issues of shares or to transfers of shares that are an integral part of a share issue. This EU case law will continue to be recognised and followed pursuant to the provisions of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the 'EUWA').",

        "page_content": "HMRC's published view is that the 1.5 per cent. SDRT or stamp duty charge continues to apply to other transfers of shares into a clearance service, although this has been disputed. In view of the continuing uncertainty, specific professional advice should be sought before incurring a 1.5 per cent stamp duty or SDRT charge in any circumstances. Any liability for stamp duty or SDRT in respect of a transfer of shares into a clearance service, or in respect of a transfer of shares within such a service, which does arise will strictly be accountable by the clearance service or its nominee but may, in practice, be payable by the relevant participant in the clearance service.\n\n## Shares held in ADS form\n\nOn the basis of EU case law referred to above and the EUWA, there should be no stamp duty or SDRT on an issuance of shares into a depositary receipt system where such transfer is an integral part of the raising of capital by the company concerned. A transfer of shares into a depositary receipt system may be subject to SDRT or stamp duty may be charged at a rate of 1.5 per cent, with subsequent transfers of depositary receipts then being free from SDRT.\n\nAny liability for stamp duty or SDRT in respect of a transfer of shares into a depositary receipt system which does arise will strictly be accountable by the depositary receipt system operator or its nominee but may, in practice, be payable by the relevant holder of the depositary receipts.\n\nAn issue of ADSs by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as depositary in respect of the ADSs will not be subject to stamp duty or SDRT. An agreement for the transfer of ADSs will not be subject to SDRT but a charge to stamp duty will technically arise on the transfer of ADSs if it is executed in the UK or relates to any property situated, or to any matter or thing done or to be done, in the UK. However, the only sanction for failing to pay such stamp duty is that the instrument of transfer cannot be produced as evidence in a UK court. Therefore, no UK stamp duty should in practice be payable on the acquisition or transfer of existing ADSs or transfer of beneficial ownership of ADSs.\n\n## Description of securities other than equity securities\n\nDeutsche Bank serves as the depositary (Depositary) for PLC's American Depositary Receipt Programme.\n\n## Depositary fees and charges for PLC\n\nUnder the terms of the Deposit Agreement for the PLC American Depositary Shares (ADSs), an ADS holder may have to pay the following service fees to the depositary bank:\n\n- \u25aa Issuance of ADSs: up to US 5\u00a2 per ADS issued.\n- \u25aa Processing of dividend and other cash distributions not made pursuant to a cancellation or withdrawal: up to US 5\u00a2 per ADS held.\n- \u25aa Cancellation of ADSs: up to US 5\u00a2 per ADS cancelled.\n\nAn ADS holder will also be responsible for paying certain fees and expenses incurred by the depositary bank and certain taxes and governmental charges such as:\n\n- \u25aa fees for the transfer and registration of shares charged by the registrar and transfer agent for the shares in the United Kingdom (i.e. upon deposit and withdrawal of shares);\n- \u25aa expenses incurred for converting foreign currency into US dollars;\n- \u25aa expenses for cable, telex and fax transmissions and for delivery of securities;\n- \u25aa taxes and duties upon the transfer of securities (i.e. when shares are deposited or withdrawn from deposit);\n- \u25aa fees and expenses incurred in connection with the delivery or servicing of shares on deposit; and\n- \u25aa fees incurred in connection with the distribution of dividends.\n\nDepositary fees payable upon the issuance and cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the depositary bank by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) receiving the newly issued ADSs from the depositary bank and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these transaction fees to their clients.\n\nNote that the fees and charges an investor may be required to pay may vary over time and may be changed by us and by the depositary bank. Notice of any changes will be given to investors.",

Management believes that the COSO framework (2013) is a suitable framework for its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting because it is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of internal controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting;\n- \u25aa Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021, and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management's assessment and conclusion excludes the Paula's Choice, Welly and Onnit from this assessment, as they were acquired on 2 August 2021, 29 January 2021 and 28 May 2021 respectively. These entities are included in our 2021 consolidated financial statements, and together they constituted approximately 3.8% of our total assets as at 31 December 2021 (of which 94% represented goodwill and intangible assets acquired) and approximately 0.4% of total turnover for the year ended 31 December 2021; and\n- \u25aa KPMG LLP, who have audited the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021, have also audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2021 and have issued an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Principal accountant fees and services\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is KPMG LLP, London, United Kingdom, Auditor Firm ID: 1118\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                        | 2021   | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|------------------------|--------|------------------|------------------|\n| Audit fees (a)         | 22     | 19               | 17               |\n| Audit-related fees (b) | 6      | 7                | -                |\n| Tax fees (c)           | -      | -                | -                |\n| All other fees (c)     | -      | -                | -                |",

Words such as 'will', 'aim', 'expects', 'anticipates', 'intends', 'looks', 'believes', 'vision', or the negative of these terms and other similar expressions of future performance or results, and their negatives, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements and information regarding the Unilever Group's (the 'Group') emissions reduction targets and other climate change related matters (including actions, potential impacts and risks associated therewith). These forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and assumptions regarding anticipated developments and other factors affecting the Group. They are not historical facts, nor are they guarantees of future performance or outcomes.\n\nBecause these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Among other risks and uncertainties, the material or principal factors which could cause actual results to differ materially are: Unilever's global brands not meeting consumer preferences; Unilever's ability to innovate and remain competitive; Unilever's investment choices in its portfolio management; the effect of climate change on Unilever's business; Unilever's ability to find sustainable solutions to its plastic packaging; significant changes or deterioration in customer relationships; the recruitment and retention of talented employees; disruptions in our supply chain and distribution; increases or volatility in the cost of raw materials and commodities; the production of safe and high quality products; secure and reliable IT infrastructure; execution of acquisitions, divestitures and business transformation projects; economic, social and political risks and natural disasters; financial risks; failure to meet high and ethical standards; and managing regulatory, tax and legal matters. A number of these risks have increased as a result of the current Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this document. Except as required by any applicable law or regulation, the Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the Group's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nThis document also contains data on the Group's Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Scope 1 and 2 emissions data is relatively easy to gather as it relates to emissions from the Group's own activities and supplied heat, power and cooling. Scope 3 emissions relate to other organisations' emissions and is therefore subject to a range of uncertainties, including that data used to model lifecycle footprints is typically industry-standard data rather than relating to individual suppliers; lifecycle models such as the Group's cover many but not all products and markets; and international standards and protocols governing emissions calculations and categorisations evolve, as do accepted norms regarding terminology such as carbon neutral and net zero. As value chain emissions data improves, shifting over time from generic modelled data to more specific data, the data reported in this document is likely to evolve.\n\nFurther details of potential risks and uncertainties affecting the Group are described in the Group's filings with the London Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Annual Report on Form 20-F 2021.\n\nThis document is not prepared in accordance with US GAAP and should not therefore be relied upon by readers as such.
