Our Group has once again demonstrated its resilience and its unwavering ability to reinvent itself. This performance is the result of the ever-renewed commitment of Saint-Gobain teams on all continents, around an ambitious and demanding purpose. It is also the translation of a consistent strategy and a clear\n\nvision; finally, it is the result of a historical culture of transmission, based on trust and empowerment of all. With such assets, the Group is ready to pursue profitable and sustainable growth. As Chairman of the Board of Directors, I am delighted by this for our employees, for our customers and for all our stakeholders.\n\nThe 2021 figures, announced on February/uni00A024, highlight  Saint-Gobain's  financial performance as well as its progress in terms of\n\nfootprint while maximizing its positive impact across its entire value chain. I would like to remind you that the Group, which had already announced its target to reduce its CO 2 emissions by 20% between 2010 and 2025, is committed to achieving the target of 'net zero emissions' by 2050.\n\nThe Board of Directors is pleased with this progress as well as with this strategy implemented by Senior Management. In this respect, I am pleased with the Board's decision to follow\n\nmy proposition and appoint Benoit Bazin to\n\nSaint-Gobain has a unique business model that combines profitable performance and contribution to sustainable development.\n\ncorporate social responsibility.

Guided by the strength of its purpose, Making the World/uni00A0a/uni00A0Better Home , the Group has a unique business model that combines profitable performance and contribution to sustainable development.

        "page_content": "## Message from Benoit Bazin\n\nChief Executive O/fficer of/uni00A0Saint-Gobain\n\n2021 was an outstanding year for Saint-Gobain, marked by the successful execution of our Grow & Impact plan, in the service of our strategy to position the Group as the worldwide leader in light and sustainable construction; a year of commitment, with the acceleration of our strategy in terms of corporate social responsibility. Saint-Gobain achieved record financial performance in 2021 and was able to make the most of a very dynamic market environment. Made possible by the very high level of commitment of the teams worldwide, this robust momentum allows the Group to continue to move forward and aim for another year of growth in 2022.\n\nThe 2021 results, underlined by a strong increase in the share price, are first and foremost the result of the expertise and unfailing mobilization of all Saint-Gobain employees, under the responsibility of a new management team. With/uni00A050%/uni00A0non-French, eight nationalities and nearly 40%/uni00A0women, this new Executive Committee reflects the wealth and diversity of our talent on a global scale.\n\nThis is also the result of two major developments. First, a new organizational structure. This is based on the complete success of our Transform & Grow competitiveness plan,  undertaken  three  years  ago  and  which  has created an organization with simplified governance,\n\na  rapid  decision-making  process and a widespread culture of trust, empowerment  and  collaboration. Local leaders, who are native to their country in more than 90% of cases, now control all of Saint-Gobain's activities within their scope, as close as possible to their teams and customers. This new multi-local organization allows the Group to develop an offering of integrated solutions and systems that enhances the full scope of its range of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin/uni00A0 2020, it is this approach that has led us to develop a/uni00A0 global leadership in construction chemicals, thanks in/uni00A0particular to/uni00A0the two significant acquisitions announced in 2021, Chryso and GCP Applied Technologies.\n\nThe challenge underlying all these transactions is the/uni00A0same: to make Saint-Gobain an ever stronger Group and to/uni00A0consolidate our performance in terms of growth superior to that of our markets - and profitability. The/uni00A0trends such as climate change, the scarcity of natural resources, rapid urbanization in emerging countries, digitalization and changes in lifestyles require/uni00A0the widespread adoption of new construction methods, which are innovative, more frugal and respectful of the circular economy; they call for e/ffective solutions for the renovation of buildings and the comfort of their users; and for the decarbonization of industry. These three vectors of structural growth are the development areas of Saint-Gobain, which has the broadest range of solutions on the market and an/uni00A0unrivalled positioning.\n\nBecause our strategy is implemented in an integrated manner, our operational performance systematically takes into account environmental, social and governance criteria. We are resolutely deploying our CSR strategy, which is at the heart of our development model. The Group has an ambitious CO 2 roadmap for 2030; details of the reduction of our direct and indirect emissions, contained in this roadmap,\n\nSaint-Gobain is able to provide answers to complex market issues.\n\nactivities in each country. Saint-Gobain\n\nis thus able to provide solutions to complex market issues, driven by/uni00A0requirements for both performance and contribution to/uni00A0sustainable development. Positioned by country as close as possible to its customers, the Group anticipates their expectations by combining its expertise, developing new products and services, implementing all its innovation know-how and exploiting the wealth of data it/uni00A0generates throughout the value chain.\n\nThe second major change concerns the optimization of our business profile, through the disposal of the least performing assets, and the acquisition of high-growth and profitable companies, perfectly aligned with our strategy. After the successful acquisition of Continental Building Products\n\nhave been validated by the SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative). Minimizing our footprint and maximizing the positive impact of our solutions are the two aspects of Saint-Gobain's day-to-day actions. We have been included in the 'Climate Change A List' established by CDP. Emissions avoided thanks to the environmental performance of/uni00A0the solutions sold by the Group in one year are 40/uni00A0times larger than its current carbon footprint. In addition, thanks to the attractiveness of the Saint-Gobain brand as an employer, for the 7 th /uni00A0 consecutive year we have been recognized as/uni00A0a/uni00A0'Top/uni00A0Employer Global', a/uni00A0 distinction that reflects the exceptional level\n\nof commitment of our employees around the world. We can be proud of that, and I would like to/uni00A0congratulate and thank them.\n\nIn this context, and excluding major impacts of/uni00A0the/uni00A0geopolitical situation, I am confident in our ability to/uni00A0continue to progress in 2022, by achieving another year of growth, both financial and extra-financial, thanks to our very good positioning on markets which are structurally buoyant over the long-term.",

It quickly expanded into international markets, establishing itself in the United States in 1829, Germany in 1858/uni00A0 (2) , Italy in 1888 and Spain in 1905.\n- In 1970, the Group, which successfully overcame the /uni25A0 major  crises  of  the  century  and  invested  heavily  in research and development, withdrew from its chemical activities and merged with Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, created in 1856 and specializing in cast iron pipes.\n- In 1986, the privatization of Saint-Gobain - which had /uni25A0 been nationalized in 1982 - was a huge popular success: 1,500,000/uni00A0shareholders subscribed to the operation/uni00A0 (3) .\n- In 1990, through the acquisition of Norton, the Group /uni25A0 doubled  its  presence  in  the  United  States,  which opened up new markets and enabled it to develop its know-how  in  the  areas  of  abrasives,  plastics  and ceramics.\n- The acquisition of Poliet in 1996 provided the basis for /uni25A0 developing  the  distribution  businesses.  Saint-Gobain then  continued  its  acquisitions  in  the  world  of construction materials trading.\n- The acquisition in 2005 of British Plaster Board, the /uni25A0 global leader in plasterboard,  was  Saint-Gobain's largest ever. Combined with Isover glass wool and its range of insulation solutions, it made Saint-Gobain the world leader in interior solutions.\n- In 2007, Saint-Gobain focused its strategy on /uni25A0 sustainable  housing,  while  continuing  to  serve  many industrial markets and, thanks to its numerous locations, continued to expand in emerging countries.\n- In 2019 and  2020,  the  Group  implemented  its /uni25A0 'Transform & Grow' plan, which aimed at establishing a new organization - by country and by market -, and to ensure an agile and value-creating portfolio management.\n- In 2020, Saint-Gobain formulated its corporate /uni25A0 purpose,  'Making  the  world  a  better  home'  (see below).\n- In 2021,  with  the  acquisition  of  Chryso  and  the /uni25A0 announcement  of  the  acquisition  of  GCP  Applied Technologies,  Saint-Gobain  would  become  a  major player in the construction chemicals sector.\n- In July/uni00A02021, the Group changed its governance, with /uni25A0 Benoit Bazin succeeding Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar as Chief Executive Officer, the latter remaining Chairman of the Board of Directors (see  this chapter, section glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> 3.1).\n- In  October/uni00A02021,  Saint-Gobain  launched  its  'Grow  & /uni25A0 Impact' strategic plan  (see  this chapter, section 3.2).\n- At  the  end  of  2021,  the  Group  was  present  in /uni25A0 75/uni00A0countries (see  this chapter, section 1.3.1).\n\n(1)  Saint-Gobain archives -\n\nhttps://archives.Saint-Gobain.com/ressource/xviie/1665/1665-louis-xiv-fonde-la-manufacture-royale-des-glaces-miroirs-linstigation-de\n\n1",

It  is  the  result  of  a  process conducted with its stakeholders: nearly 15,000 in-house contributions, over 600  workshops  worldwide  and contributions from external stakeholders such as investors, NGOs, partners and opinion leaders.\n\n## 'MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER HOME': THE MANIFESTO\n\nOur purpose sets the course for our common future. Together  with  and  for  our  customers,  we  design, manufacture  and  distribute  materials  and  solutions that have a positive impact on everyone's life and provide well-being, quality of life and performance, while caring for the planet.\n\nOur purpose reflects who we are.

        "page_content": "## Values: the Saint-Gobain Principles of Conduct and Action 2.2.2\n\nBuilding  on  its  corporate  purpose,  the  Group  bases  its development on strong values embodied in nine Principles of Conduct and Action, which constitute a true code of ethics. Formalized in 2003, translated into 31 languages,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PRINCIPLES OF CONDUCT\n\n- Professional commitment /uni25A0\n- Respect for others /uni25A0\n- Integrity /uni25A0\n- Loyalty /uni25A0\n- Solidarity /uni25A0\n\nThese principles of conduct are the fundamental values that unite managers and employees.\n\nThe Principles of Conduct and Action refer explicitly to the applicable conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO), the International Charter on Human Rights, the Guidelines for multinational enterprises of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the OECD's convention on the fight against corruption. Saint-Gobain has been signed up to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. This demonstrates  the  Group's  drive  for  Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR), which includes regular communication of its progress in areas covered by the Global Compact.\n\nThe implementation of the Group's strategy is reflected in policies and commitments applied by all of its entities in all countries in which they operate. Foremost among these\n\nand distributed to all employees, these principles constitute an ethical reference applicable in action. They are a condition of belonging to Saint-Gobain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PRINCIPLES OF ACTION\n\n- Respect for the law /uni25A0\n- Caring for the environment /uni25A0\n- Respect for health and safety at work /uni25A0\n- Respect for employee rights /uni25A0\n\nThese principles guide the actions of all management and employees in the performance of their duties.\n\ncommitments  are  the  'reference  policies'.  These  are directly derived from the Principles of Conduct and Action and define the management principles applicable to all Saint-Gobain  entities  and  employees,  as  well  as  to subcontractors in their work for the Group, and suppliers under the Responsible Purchasing policy (see chapter/uni00A03, section glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> 1.4).\n\nThis  desire  to  establish  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action as a sign of belonging is illustrated by the objective set  by  the  Group's  Board  of  Directors,  of  training  all managers  in  the  Principles  in  their  first  year  with  the Group. In addition, the Principles of Conduct and Action are included in the welcome booklets for all Saint-Gobain employees  and  in  most  employment  contracts  (see chapter/uni00A03, section 1.1.1).\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\n1",

As a a value that is common to all its employees, this ambition lies within the framework of both  its  Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action  and  its corporate  purpose.  It  draws  on  the  Group's  policy regarding the environment, health and safety, and on its principles in terms of social responsibility.\n\nWith regard to its employees , Saint-Gobain's promotes a healthy work environment by managing professional risks -  including  psychological  risks  -  thanks  to  action  plans managed  at  local  and  global  levels  and  monitored  in accordance  with  the  Groups'  guidelines  and  standards, and by taking into account both the diversity of profiles and the most fragile categories of people. It also means fostering  better  health  thanks  to  customized  medical monitoring,  adapted  to  each  individual's  risk  profile; deploying global prevention campaigns; ensuring welfare protection for all; and workstation ergonomics adaptation or  personalized  mobility  programs  in  the  event  of limitations in the employee's ability to work (see chapter 3, section 4.2.1).\n\nWith regard to its clients and the users of its solutions , Saint-Gobain's approach aims at ensuring safe use of its products and materials throughout their entire lifecycles, from  design  -  notably  by  working  on  the  choice  of component substances with its suppliers - to the use stage and to their end of life. It also entails promoting health and wellbeing of clients and  end  users,  and  fostering transparency  and  dialogue,  thanks  to  products  and solutions that bring benefits in terms of acoustic, thermal, and  visual  comfort  as  well  as  in  terms  of  internal  air quality.\n\nWith regards to the residents and communities adjacent to its sites , the Group's ambition means protecting health and wellbeing of individuals by abiding by all applicable regulations and by going further; continuously reducing the environmental impact of its operations; collaborating with  local  public  healthcare  agencies;  participating  in community  social  development,    notably  via  housing-, education-  and  professional  integration-related  projects; fostering  skill-based  and  equipment-based  sponsorship; maintaining dialogue with all stakeholders (see chapter 3, section 2.3).\n\nSaint-Gobain's health promotion approach implies involvement on the part of top management, leading by example, collaboration and empowerment  of  all, transparency and dialogue with all stakeholders, regulatory,  scientific  and  societal  monitoring,  process control and continuous improvement . The Group's health policy, applicable in all its sites, entails, as a minimum, full compliance with local regulations. This policy is tantamount to a personal and collective pledge on the part  of  all  Saint-Gobain  personnel.  Each  employee  is involved in protecting health and promoting wellbeing, for the  sake  of  all.  It  helps  the  Group  being  an  attractive workplace, demonstrating its difference and its desire to have a positive impact on its stakeholders.\n\nIn general, the Group puts operational excellence at the heart of its model, in the context of a particularly complex value chain (see chapter/uni00A03, section 3.1). This concerns first of  all links  with  Saint-Gobain  customers by  seeking  a close alignment between its offers and current and future market expectations, by cultivating ever greater proximity with its customers, by analyzing their satisfaction, and by deploying  the  \"Solutions  for  Growth\"  program,  which consists of analyzing the whole package of products and services offered by the Group and quantifying their ability to provide customers with performance and sustainability benefits (see chapter/uni00A03, section 3.4.4).\n\nThis  ambition  for  excellence  also  concerns industrial performance : first and foremost, the aim is to continuously improve processes and results across all operations, from environmental risk management to industrial and distribution risks. It is then a question of conducting a continuous improvement approach in terms of environmental  protection,  in  all  its  dimensions:  GHG emissions (greenhouse gas), water and natural resource management, recycling and protection of biodiversity (see chapter/uni00A03, section 2).\n\nLastly, it involves managing  the relationship with Saint-Gobain suppliers . This concerns, first of all, purchasing, a key factor in the Group's competitiveness, whose  effectiveness  and  the  related  risks  must  be managed.  This  also  applies  to  transport  and  logistics across the entire value chain, by maximizing Saint-Gobain's  contribution  to  bringing  benefits  to  its customers  by  guaranteeing  service  (satisfaction  and loyalty) and the profitability of its operations (optimization of costs and inventories) while minimizing its footprint in order to reduce CO2 emissions of physical flows (logistics and transport) by optimizing its supply chain (information flows and material/product flows).",

Firstly, accelerating  income  and  cash  generation ,  with organic sales growth of between 3% and 5%, an operating margin  of  between  9%  and  11%,  and  a  free  cash  flow conversion rate of over 50%.

Finally, an attractive shareholder return policy , with an annual dividend payout rate of between 30% and 50% of recurring net income, paid in cash, and a share buyback program worth up to \u20ac2/uni00A0billion  for  the  period  2021-2025  equivalent  to  more than  30/uni00A0million  net  shares  bought  back  based  on  the recent Saint-Gobain share price.\n\nConcerning  the business  portfolio , the  Group's  scope continues  to  be  regularly  reviewed:  performance  and strategic  alignment  for  disposals,  and  capital  allocation according to specific criteria for value-creating acquisitions. This involves allocating the necessary resources  for  development  in  markets  with  growth potential  (see  chapter/uni00A02,  section  3.1)  and  taking  the necessary measures, on an ongoing basis, to restructure, optimize or dispose of activities that are underperforming (cf . chapter/uni00A02, section 4.2).\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Feedback on a pivotal year 3.2\n\n2021 was a year of transition for Saint-Gobain in more ways than one. Firstly, this is the second year of the 'new normal' following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences. Beyond the shock of the crisis, this event has profound effects on growth, consumption, the organization  of  production  and  supply  chains.  These phenomena have a direct impact on the Group's value creation model: in a context of accelerating energy cost inflation, in October/uni00A02021 for example,  Saint-Gobain expected an increase in its energy and raw materials costs of around \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion in 2021 compared to 2020, of which \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion for the second half alone/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nThis set of new  constraints and  risk factors is superimposed on major trends , both structural and global, such as climate change, depletion of natural resources, population growth, digitalization or changing lifestyles (see chapter/uni00A02, section 1.1). In this context, the light and sustainable construction sector, in which the Group is very well positioned, represents a structurally growing market , requiring solutions that can help decarbonize the economy, move towards the circular economy, and meet the needs arising from urbanization.\n\nIn this context, in 2020 Saint-Gobain took up the challenge posed by the pandemic, by taking care of its stakeholders, by demonstrating its commitment to serving society as a whole,  and  by  demonstrating  its  ability  to  prepare  the future, thanks to an agility and tenacity which are both the  product  of  the  Group's  culture  and  the  strategic orientations adopted as part of the 'Transform & Grow/uni00A0 (2) ' plan. This transformation plan, announced at the end of 2018  and  implemented  over  a  two-year  period,  has enabled Saint-Gobain to achieve major objectives: greater speed and greater consistency in its operations; refocusing on growth and cash generation requirements; and lastly, maintaining a portfolio of activities and brands consistent with the strategy, through a value-creating approach to mergers, acquisitions and disposals.\n\nIn  early  2021,  Saint-Gobain  was an  efficient  Group, strengthened  by  its  new  local  organization  and  its 'multi-national'  culture , driven  by  performance  and proximity to its customers, whose employees share the same ambition, summarized by its purpose: 'Making the world  a  better  home'. On  these  solid  foundations, Saint-Gobain announced its strategic plan in October/uni00A02021, 'Grow  &  Impact' , formulating  a  clear vision: to be the worldwide leader in light and sustainable\n\n- (2)  Saint-Gobain 2020 Universal Registration Document, p.18-20.\n\nconstruction , improving the daily lives of everyone thanks to its high performance solutions (see chapter/uni00A02, section 2). The Group is thus positioned as a provider of solutions to the  complex  problems  faced  by  its  customers, satisfying a dual requirement  of  sustainability and performance (see chapter/uni00A03, section 3.4.4).\n\nBy capitalizing on its potential for innovation, and by fully exploiting the source of value offered by data, 'Grow & Impact'  aims  to  enable  Saint-Gobain  to  outperform  its underlying markets, achieve  its CSR  objectives  by systematically  minimizing  its  footprint  across  its  entire value chain, and maximize its positive impact in multiple areas:  customer  satisfaction  and  performance,  value creation for its shareholders, as well as the well-being and commitment of its employees.\n\n- 'Grow' represents the power to boost Saint-Gobain's /uni25A0 growth  as  an  international  Group by  designing, producing and distributing the most innovative, efficient and sustainable solutions for its customers;\n- 'Impact'  represents  the  responsibility  of having  a /uni25A0 positive impact on everyone's life by ensuring personal and  collective  well-being,  while  taking  care  of  the planet.\n\nTo achieve Saint-Gobain's medium and long-term objectives, the 'Grow & Impact' plan is based on six major levers: positioning itself in high-growth markets ; being a supplier of solutions; accelerating growth by putting the customer at the heart of innovation and by unleashing the power of digital technology through the collection and use of  data; embedding  CSR  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's business model ; feeding a culture of trust and responsibility ;  and  finally, focusing  on  talent,  diversity and inclusion . For the full presentation of the 'Grow & Impact'  plan  and  its  various  priorities,  see  chapter/uni00A02, section 3.\n\n2021 was also marked by a milestone in the governance of Saint-Gobain,  the  transfer  of  responsibilities  between Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar and Benoit Bazin. From July/uni00A01, the  latter  took  over  as  Chief  Executive  Officer,  in accordance  with  the  decision  taken  by  the  Board  of Directors  to  ensure  a  smooth  transition,  separating  the functions  of  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar remains Chairman of the Board of Directors of Saint-Gobain/uni00A0 (3) .\n\n1",

These  solutions  provide  the  Group's  customers  with benefits in terms of performance and sustainability (see chapter/uni00A03, section 3.4.4), while meeting the challenges that shape the future of the economy and society.\n\nToday, Saint-Gobain already covers most of the applications for renovation as well as for new\n\nconstruction ,  and  in  particular  sustainable  construction: interior systems, interior and exterior insulation, cladding, floor coverings, fa\u00e7ades  and  lightweight  structures, glazing, ceilings, waterproofing, roofing solutions, pre-assembly and prefabrication, and the distribution of products,  solutions  and  services  for  construction  and housing. The Group's high performance solutions , for their part, help meet the market's growing needs on issues such as the decarbonization of construction processes, sustainable mobility and sustainable industry.\n\n## An offer based on the expectations of/uni00A0Saint-Gobain/uni00A0customers 4.1\n\n## Customers in the construction 4.1.1 and renovation market\n\n## Single-family homes 4.1.1.1\n\nOn all continents, the Group markets complete solutions, combining  innovative  products  and  services  for  the building  envelope  (with  brands  such  as  Saint-Gobain, Weber, Isover and CertainTeed, the market leader in North America),  with  interior  solutions  (with  brands  such  as Placo\u00ae), or services  dedicated  to  professionals  and individuals (with programs such as Solu+ or La Maison Saint-Gobain in France).\n\nFor the construction of an individual residence, the Group offers a whole range of solutions for pipes, ventilation and electricity, both inside and outside the building. Saint-Gobain is also making progress on innovations such as three-dimensional printing, which optimize construction time and minimize waste production.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  present  in  several  countries  in  the distribution market, with brands such as Point.P, Telhanorte, Optimera and Dahl, which makes it possible to offer an unrivaled range of solutions, particularly in the case of renovation. In France, Saint-Gobain offers a range of products and services through its sole retailer Point.P, from thermal insulation to adhesives, as well as partition solutions and construction site waste collection services. The Group leverages the strength of its offering to take full advantage of the renovation market opportunities. This involves,  for  example,  bringing  to  market  a  complete series of solutions for the renovation of a single family home  (33  products  and  services)  helping  achieve  long term energy consumption objectives (with 70% savings), better comfort  (acoustics,  luminosity,  air  quality  in particular) and lower CO2 emissions (275 tonnes eq. CO2 over 50 years by housing unit).\n\n## Collective residential and non-residential 4.1.1.2\n\nSaint-Gobain  responds  to  the  complex  issues  of  the construction and renovation of multi-family residential and non-residential buildings, with solutions covering both the interiors  of  buildings  and  the  distribution  of  spaces, through partition systems (in particular to allow\n\nsubsequent  reuse  or  change  in  the  use  of  spaces throughout  the  life  of  the  building);  on  the  building envelope, in particular by offering innovative solutions for lightweight fa\u00e7ades  combining  several  systems  and products,  or  through  the  supply  of  cutting-edge  glass solutions; recycling services to recover waste on construction  sites,  in  particular  to  supply  its  industrial manufacturing processes, in a circular approach. In Brazil, no less than 13 products and services (and up to 21 in Germany) are integrated into the solutions proposed by the Group for the construction of a multi-family residential building.  Saint-Gobain's  offering  provides  its  customers (developers, architects, building professionals, owners and end users) with a whole range of benefits, notably in terms of  reducing  energy  costs,  speed  of  construction  and reducing the carbon footprint, and easier dismantling. The Group's  advanced  expertise  in  the  field  of  Innovative Materials also enables architects to design iconic buildings with original and innovative shapes.\n\nSaint-Gobain  thus  supports  market  demand  on  all continents by providing solutions adapted to each region of  the  world.  Its  offer  meets  expectations  in  terms  of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in terms of volume and  price  of  housing,  and  in  terms  of  comfort  and well-being.\n\n## Industrial customers 4.1.2\n\n## Mobility 4.1.2.1\n\nIn  the  mobility  sector,  with  brands  such  as  Sekurit, Saint-Gobain manufactures and delivers windshields, side windows,  rear  windows,  glass  roofs  and  pre-assembled modules  to  major  car  manufacturers.  These  solutions ensure everyday comfort for drivers and passengers and respond to the changes in mobility in terms of use and regulations, notably as regards to the environment. The Group  is  thus  a  key  player  in  the  transition  of  the automotive market (see chapter/uni00A02, section 1.2.2); number one in the glass market for electric vehicles, it offers a whole series of solutions (in particular with systems for insulation, batteries and electric motors) to improve their performance  in  terms  of  energy  efficiency,  well-being, security and connectivity.",

Beyond the traditional approach of meeting a specific need with an appropriate product, the objective is to offer its customers end-to-end support for complex issues , modeled as 'use cases' or situations, such as the construction of a single-family house or the renovation of a  hospital  (see  chapter  3,  section  3.4.4).  The  Group analyzed all of its product and service lines to define four situations  in  which  it  proposes solutions  for  global markets (engineering and infrastructure, mobility, industrial markets) and 22 in which it offers solutions for local  markets (new  construction  and  renovation  for residential and non-residential buildings).\n\nSaint-Gobain's  organization  by  country  and  by  market enables it to be as close as possible to its customers and anticipate  their  expectations,  taking  into  account  local specificities,  whether  in  terms  of  architectural  styles, building methods, climate, standards and regulations, or cultural particularities. By capitalizing on its proximity to its customers, by combining its skills, by inventing new services, by strengthening synergies between its business lines, by accelerating innovation and data, by offering its employees an open and inclusive working environment,\n\nthe Group differentiates itself and offers the widest range to better meet the expectations of its customers, as well as performance and\n\nof integrated solutions on the market sustainable development challenges.\n\n## \u2026 incorporating strong business 4.2.2 expertise\n\n## Glazing for buildings and cars 4.2.2.1\n\nTo address the challenges associated with protecting the environment, aesthetics, comfort, ergonomics and safety, Saint-Gobain  develops,  produces  and  sells high-tech glazing solutions intended for the fa\u00e7ade, window and interior  decoration  markets  and  to  protect  assets  and people. With brands such as Saint-Gobain, GlassSolutions, Vetrotech and SageGlass (see the list of the Group's main brands below, section 4.3), the Group's offering ranges from the production and transformation of flat glass to the distribution of glass solutions for the building market.\n\nSaint-Gobain aspires to be the partner of choice for its\n\ncustomers: installers, processors, manufacturers, distributors  and  architects.  The  Group's  glass  solutions improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings  and  user comfort in all its dimensions : thermal insulation, control of light  inputs,  aesthetics,  interior  design  and  decoration, protection against bullets or fires. These properties are obtained  as  a  result  of  thin  film  technologies:  using physical and chemical methods, stacks of films transform the glass into functional glazing. This means that the most complex glazing can consist of up to twenty successive layers.  Saint-Gobain  presents  itself  as  the  technological leader  in  the  sector  by  bringing  to  market  innovations such  as  Priva-Lite  active  glazing,  which  is  electrically opaque on demand, or SageGlass solutions, with variable tint, mainly offered for fa\u00e7ade projects.

These advances include solutions such as the integration of Eclaz One in fa\u00e7ade solutions for the construction of new  multi-family buildings, or Planitherm Stadip glass for the renovation of single-family homes, in particular to increase the reflection of  thermal  infrared  rays  and  limit  the  loss  of  heat  by radiation.\n\nEndlessly recyclable, glass, in all its forms - from window and fa\u00e7ade glass to automotive glass - is one of the areas where  the  Group's  commitment  to  the sustainable development of the circular economy materializes (see chapter/uni00A03, section 2.2). This requires both investment in industrial processes - in particular to eliminate all types of contaminants  present  in  glass  waste  -  and  also  the development  of  efficient and  sustainable collection networks. It is in this spirit that Saint-Gobain Glass France signed  partnership  agreements  from  2019  with  several companies  specializing  in  the  recovery  of  end-of-life windows. In addition to recovery, these companies sort and process glass to facilitate its reincorporation into glass floats.\n\n## Gypsum 4.2.2.2\n\nPlaster-based  solutions  for  partitions  and  coverings  for walls, fa\u00e7ades, ceilings and floors provide Group customers with benefits in terms of thermal and acoustic comfort,  fire  protection  and  humidity  resistance,  thus meeting  the  growing  market  demand.  Gypsum  is  a decisive asset in Saint-Gobain's vision, formulated as part of the 'Grow & Impact' plan, and which aims to make the company the worldwide leader in light and sustainable construction . Among the advantages of this construction method (see chapter/uni00A02, section 1.2.1.2), depending on the type  of  building,  wall  construction  processes  using plaster-based partitions can produce time savings of 20% to  50%  compared  to  traditional  materials.  In  emerging markets  in  particular,  the  replacement  of  traditional masonry walls with plasterboard walls represents a very significant source of growth.\n\nTo develop this offer, the Group extracts and transforms gypsum into an extensive range of plaster-based products for the construction and renovation markets, through all of its brands such as Placo\u00ae, Rigips and Gyproc (see the list of Saint-Gobain's main brands below, section 4.3), thanks to  increasingly  efficient  and  virtuous  industrial  facilities, particularly in terms of energy consumption, diversification of  energy  sources,  and  the  commissioning  of  the  first carbon neutral plasterboard plant in Norway planned for 2023. These solutions comply with the highest technological standards and Saint-Gobain promotes their widespread adoption, and remain a step ahead of new regulations  concerning,  for  example,  the  elimination  of formaldehyde to improve interior air quality (Activ'Air\u00ae).\n\nGypsum  can  be  recycled  indefinitely  in  a  closed  loop, thanks to processes allowing the removal of contaminants embedded  in  the  paper  present  on  the  faces  of  the plasterboard. The Group has waste recovery and gypsum recycling services in a dozen countries in order to supply its industrial sites with recycled raw materials (up to 30% of input materials in some plants), also contributing to the Group's strategic positioning in the global movement to expand the circular economy. Saint-Gobain continues to\n\nexpand  in  this  market,  strengthening  its  presence  and industrial  capacities,  notably  through  the  acquisition  of Continental Building Products in the United States in 2020.\n\n## Ceilings 4.2.2.3\n\nThrough its portfolio of complementary brands such as Ecophon, CertainTeed, Eurocoustic, Sonex, or Vinh Tuong (see the list of the Group's main brands below, section 4.3), Saint-Gobain is one of the world leaders in ceiling solutions , providing  benefits  particularly  in  terms  of thermal and acoustic insulation. The Group offers a wide range of multi-material solutions (glass wool, stone wool, metal) for ceilings and wall panels that combine acoustics and aesthetics for the comfort and well-being of the end user. Its main brand, Ecophon, develops high-performance acoustic  systems  (capable  of  halving  noise  pollution) intended  primarily  for  non-residential  markets  (offices, schools,  healthcare  buildings).  Other  solutions,  such  as custom-made  heated  and  cooled  metal  ceilings,  by Plafometal, bring comfort benefits to a whole series of situations, from research centers to entertainment venues open to the public.\n\n## Insulation 4.2.2.4\n\nIn residential and non-residential buildings , Saint-Gobain's insulation market  offering  meets  the challenges of reducing energy consumption and improving thermal and acoustic comfort . All of its brands, such as Isover, CertainTeed and Izocam, offer a wide range of products, from mineral wools (glass wool, rock wool), to polystyrene  and  polyurethane  foams,  to bio-sourced products (wood fibers), thus covering the insulation needs of all types of buildings as well as their interior installations (roofs, walls, floors). Its offer brings benefits in terms of ease  of  installation for  professionals  and  in  terms  of efficiency and sustainability for investors and owners.\n\nThe Group has considerably increased its production of glass  wool  for  blowing,  a  mechanized  solution,  greatly reducing installation time. It is complemented by a whole range of solutions for insulating heating or air conditioning systems, improve their efficiency and reduce their energy consumption.  The  Climaver  range,  for  example,  is  a 'two-in-one' product that replaces metal ducts as well as thermal and acoustic insulation. The solutions proposed by Saint-Gobain  for  the  exterior  and  interior  insulation  of walls also support  the  strong  momentum  in  the renovation  market (see  chapter/uni00A02,  section  1.2.1.1),  with innovations such as Optimax  Habito,  which  saves installation time by 20% on average, reduces the risk of injury,  and  also  reduces  waste  on  site  and  makes  the materials used in this solution completely recyclable.\n\nThe Group also provides cutting-edge insulation solutions for a very wide range of applications outside construction, ranging from engine compartments and vehicle interiors (cars,  railcars,  ships,  etc.)  to  household  appliances  and photovoltaic panels.\n\nIn  the  insulation  market,  Saint-Gobain  is  once  again demonstrating its commitment to circularity . It should be remembered  that mineral wools can be recycled indefinitely.  In  France,  Isover  is  the  first  player  in  the market to have launched a glass wool waste recovery service and recycling them by reinjecting them into its production  process.  The  Group  acts  both  through  the technical  characteristics  of  its  solutions  and  through initiatives  such  as  its  ILOOP  project,  supported  by  the European Union, to contribute to the gradual recovery of glass wool waste generated on construction or demolition sites, or through its participation in the European project for the recovery of mineral wool waste WOOL2LOOP.",

        "page_content": "## Mortars and construction chemicals 4.2.2.5\n\nProtecting, insulating and decorating are among the key functions of Saint-Gobain's fa\u00e7ade offering. The Group is one  of  the  world  leaders  in  the  field  of  mortars  and building  chemicals  with  brands  such  as  Weber.  The Groups' special tiling solutions ensure safety and ease of use . In  flooring,  its  solutions  cover  various  fields  of application:  new  and  renovated  subfloors,  leveling  and finishing prior to laying a floor, decoration with the use of self-colored mortars, solutions for areas of high footfall and underfloor heating, as well as a pump truck service to improve the productivity and comfort of installers.\n\nA  range  of  mortars  is  available,  covering all  areas  of construction , to  help  in  structural  work,  rework  and water-proofing solutions. A line of admixtures caters to the growing demand for improved technical properties in concrete for use in construction.\n\nThe  Group  is  expanding  rapidly  on  the construction chemicals  market ,  notably  thanks  to  the  acquisition  in 2021 of Chryso, specializing in admixtures for construction materials, providing differentiated and innovative solutions and employing 1,300 people. Saint-Gobain also announced in 2021 the signature of an agreement for the acquisition of  all  GCP  Applied  Technologies  shares,  as  well  as significant acquisitions in Mexico (with Impac), in Romania (with Duraziv), in Peru (with Z Aditivos), and in Russia (with  Adheziv).  These  acquisitions  represent  a  decisive step towards establishing the Group as a worldwide leader in construction chemicals,  with more than \u20ac4 billion in sales (as opposed to \u20ac3 billion previously). Pooling  these resources  offers  customers  a  highly  comprehensive portfolio and global coverage.\n\n## Exterior Products 4.2.2.6\n\nSaint-Gobain  is  present  in  the  United  States  and  Latin America with a full range of outdoor products through its CertainTeed brand. For roofs, the Group offers premium asphalt and composite shingles, roll roofing systems and accessories. For fa\u00e7ades, it offers shingle, insulation and vinyl cladding solutions. Saint-Gobain also supplies solutions  such  as  barriers,  terraces  and  balustrades. Solutions incorporating these various products provide the Group's customers with benefits in terms of aesthetics, ease  of  installation  and  maintenance,  and  resistance  to bad weather.\n\n## Distribution of products, solutions and 4.2.2.7 services for construction and housing\n\nSaint-Gobain serves hundreds of thousands of customers each  year  on  the construction,  renovation  and  home improvement  markets . With  brands  such  as  CEDEO, Point.P, Optimera and Dahl (see the list of the Group's main brands below, section 4.3), the Group has a network of strong and complementary brands, both generalist and specialist. Primarily oriented towards trade customers, the Saint-Gobain trading brands also serve small and medium-sized businesses and large companies and allow for a presence  of  the  Group  across  the  whole construction value chain . They also support individuals in the completion of their projects with professionals. The various  brands  thus  strive  to  balance  their  customer portfolios, a guarantee of solidity and profitability. Another major asset is the regional network: in France, the Group has more than 2,000 sales outlets, anchored in the local fabric, able to serve the most dynamic economic areas.\n\nThe Group's expertise in the field of distribution is key to achieve the strategic goals of the Grow & Impact plan (see in this chapter, section 3.2) by providing its professional clients  with  a  large  array  of  solutions  and making\n\nSaint-Gobain a one-stop-shop provider . It also allows for a very high degree of proximity with the Group's clients , thanks  to  data  collection  and  analysis  (see  chapter  2, section  3.3.2)  and  thanks  to  the support Saint-Gobain provides  its  clients  with  across  the  board,  including training on its products and services (see below). It also makes possible for the Group to capture the structural growth  of  the  residential  building  renovation  market  in Europe (see chapter 2, section 1.2.1.1).\n\nLogistics is essential to distribution and receives special attention  through  the  automation  and  robotization  of processes.  The  trading  brands  are  making  a  system  of centralized logistics bases and adapted delivery centers increasingly efficient. This allows for a successful deployment  of  Saint-Gobain's  e-commerce  offering  (as regards  delivery  times  especially)  for  low-volume  and low-weight  products  in  particular.  To  support  logistics, robust  information  systems  are  necessary.  Thanks  in particular to data collection and analysis, digital technology is one of the tools available to Saint-Gobain brands  to offer customers  a  unique  omnichannel experience : e-commerce, m-commerce, enhanced product content (features, descriptions, visuals, technical and regulatory sheets, etc.), as well as digital services that save time. The teams also benefit from productivity tools (Robotic  Process  Automation),  machine  learning  and optimal data exploitation using data processing algorithms. This approach allows us to better understand and model product and customer targets to optimize the work of the sales force. Ultimately, digital technology acts as a lever to boost the Group's growth (see chapter/uni00A02, section 3.3.2).\n\nThrough distribution, Saint-Gobain is also committed to supporting its professional clients throughout their journey.  On  the  French  market,  the  Group  is  giving concrete expression to this commitment by designing and marketing services ranging from training (tens of thousands of clients trained as regards the RGE label - see chapter/uni00A03, section 2.1.6.3) to the recovery of site waste (with  the Ripeurs  du  B\u00e2timent for  instance)  to  digital solutions offering assistance with estimates and costing on construction sites (with the Solu+ platform), or the rapid generation  of  estimates  and  invoices  (with  the  Tolteck solution).\n\nLastly, distribution is an  area  where  Saint-Gobain's demands in the area of responsibility materialize. This is reflected, for example, in the search for an ever smaller delivery logistics footprint , notably thanks to low-carbon delivery  solutions,  the  optimization  of  circuits  and  the installation of sales outlets in the heart of urban areas (see chapter/uni00A03, section 3.2.2); or through the use of distribution chains as an essential tool in the collection of waste from construction sites, with a view to promoting the circular economy . In  2017,  Saint-Gobain  Distribution  B\u00e2timent France set up structures to collect waste from the same types of construction materials, products and equipment that  it  sells  to  professionals,  thus  becoming  the  first private network of site waste collection points - with ca. 150 points -  in the construction and public works sector.\n\n## Pipe 4.2.2.8\n\nSaint-Gobain offers complete solutions drawing on more than 165/uni00A0years of experience in the water supply market to meet the highest expectations. Through its PAM brand, the Group produces and markets ductile cast iron pipe systems  for  drinking  water  and  sanitation,  covers  and gratings  for  roads  as  well  as  cast  iron  systems  for collecting  and  evacuating  wastewater  and  rainwater  in buildings;  it  also  serves  the  mining,  hydroelectric  and industrial sectors. Saint-Gobain's offer is aimed at public\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Organization and governance 5.\n\n## The Group's global organization 5.1\n\n## Priority to the local level 5.1.1\n\nSince 2019, Saint-Gobain has been organized according to its customers and therefore by geographical areas for its regional businesses, and by global Business Units within the  High  Performance  Solutions  entity,  with  a  view  to improving agility and remaining as close as possible to its customers . Based  on  'Transform  &  Grow'  plan,  the Group's corporate governance model , which is as close as possible to its markets, is part of a resolutely multi-national approach. The new  organization has enabled  a profound  culture  change , highlighting  the empowerment  of  teams , their performance , and  the satisfaction of customer needs, and granting a high degree of decision-making autonomy at the local level.\n\nThe  organization  and  culture  of  Saint-Gobain  have therefore been profoundly transformed, with a simplified structure ('one boss principle') and 90% of CEOs being native to the region where they operate. The new rules for executive  compensation  (bonus  entirely  linked  to  the performance of the country or market) are aligned with performance:  priority  given  to  cash  generation,  ROCE, Ebitda  and  ESG  impact  (on  greenhouse  gas  emissions, diversity  and  safety).  In  full  control  of  the  Group's development in their market, they also aim to shape the evolution of local construction ecosystems.\n\n## The strength of a global footprint 5.1.2\n\nAt the global level, the strength of an international group allows it to build up a pool of expertise to support its local activities  in  the  fields  of  research  and  development, marketing, technological and  industrial performance, innovation and performance in distribution; it also makes it possible  to  test  many  innovative  business  models,  in different contexts, and to promote the exchange of best practices between countries.\n\nThis clearly differentiates Saint-Gobain from its competitors : in addition to its in-depth knowledge of local markets, the Group sets itself apart from local competitors through its capacity for innovation and the operational excellence provided by its cross-functional organization at the global level. Through the richness of its offering and its ability  to  offer  complete  solutions  adapted  to  each customer segment, Saint-Gobain stands out from its local and international competitors.\n\n## The search for synergies 5.1.3\n\nThe  Group's  new  organization  creates synergies  in support functions: with unique customer services, shared online stores and common logistics, sales forces can work more efficiently and devote more time to cross-selling and\n\nupselling.  It  has  also  led to  changes  in  commercial structures .  The  search  for  synergies  is  also  manifested through  the  creation  of  unique  platforms  such  as  'La Maison Saint-Gobain' in France to support end-customers in their renovation projects.\n\nOn the other hand, the objective is to offer customers combined offers and to make the Group a one-stop-shop for a given application. In Brazil, the 'Fa\u00e7ade' Business Unit thus groups the Placo\u00ae, Isover, Weber, Brasilit and Adfors  solutions  within  a  single  offering.  Using  these synergies, Saint-Gobain facilitates the customer experience by offering complete building systems along with exclusive related services. The customer only has to place a single order to receive all of the products at the worksite,  while  a  Saint-Gobain  team  also  ensures  the smoothness of the work on site.\n\nThanks  to  its  global  dimension, the  Group  develops cross-selling  and  supports  its  customers  all  over  the world . In  addition,  the  creation  of  central  centers  of expertise, on which countries can rely - on topics such as industrial performance, marketing, innovation and research and development, information systems, as well as HR and Finance Shared Service Centers -facilitates the improvement  of  the  Group's  performance  in  terms  of critical mass, sharing of best practices, cost containment, widespread deployment of excellence programs, as well as technical and collaborative work-flows.\n\nThe  sharing  of  knowledge  and  expertise,  essential  to promote  synergies,  is  facilitated  by  meetings  between innovation and marketing professionals, and has materialized with the creation of the 'Hive' community. Another example is the global roll-out via the Unicampus program (see chapter/uni00A03, section 4.3.5), of a training offer that  includes  courses  on  the  main  central  functions (marketing, industrial performance, sustainable development, research and development, purchasing, etc.) combining theory, practice and experience sharing.\n\nFinally, synergies are also generated through the spreading a culture of innovation , allowing the development of dynamic project management methods, putting the customer at the heart of the approach. This culture has historically been expressed in different ways within Saint-Gobain:\n\n- the Group's industrial business lines can thus benefit /uni25A0 from the experience of retailers in terms of digitizing their product and service offering for customers;\n- the regional businesses, in the construction markets, are /uni25A0 increasingly developing a co-development approach, a model  that  is  in  the  DNA  of  the  High  Performance Solutions  businesses.  They  thus  benefit  from  the experiences already existing within Saint-Gobain.\n\n1",

These are long-term  trends,  which  are  mutually  reinforcing,  and whose effects are made more visible by the occurrence of an economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe effects of the latter are still being strongly felt, at the end of 2021, through phenomena such as the disruption of supply  chains,  the  increase  in  raw  material  prices,  the dynamics of consumption, inflation and, more generally, seesaw effects (sharp falls and recoveries) on economic\n\nGrowth rate of global GDP, 1990-2026\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-4\n\nactivity. In October/uni00A02021, Saint-Gobain thus anticipated an increase in its energy and raw materials costs of around \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion in 2021 compared to 2020, of which \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion for the second half alone/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nIn  general,  the  pandemic  makes  it  more  difficult  to forecast in the short and medium term, due to the great variability of its impact from one country to another, as well as the uncertainties that persist on the outcome of the health crisis. However, there is a rebound in growth in 2021 that is greater than the drop in GDP observed in 2020/uni00A0 (2) .\n\n2",

A drastic reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a global scale is essential. However, the overall trend is not satisfactory, with a trend in GHG emissions that has remained, over the last few years, in a direction contrary to this objective.\n\n## Global CO2 emissions, 1960-2019/uni00A0 (1)\n\n(index 100 in 1990)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic had a temporary beneficial effect on CO2 emissions in 2020, with a decrease due to the drop in  production  and  transport.  The  momentum  remains worrying  across  all  indicators,  for  example,  with  global demand for coal exceeding the levels of 2019 in 2021 and approaching its record level of 2014, as indicated by the International  Energy  Agency/uni00A0 (2) . In  this  context,  the positive note comes from the renewable energy sector, whose electricity production is expected to increase by more than 8% to 8,300 TWh in 2021, the highest annual growth since the 1970s/uni00A0 (3) .\n\nIn  2015,  the  Paris  Agreement  established  an  important benchmark by setting out the ambition to keep the rise in temperatures below 2\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial era, which means reducing GHG emissions by 2.7% per year from 2020 to 2030. Each year, on the basis of the latest  scientific  work,  the  Emissions  Gap  Report  of  the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) compares the gap between these commitments and the reduction required to meet the objective. Its latest edition, published in October/uni00A02021/uni00A0 (4) , indicates  that  with  the  climate commitments, the trajectory results in an increase of 2.7\u00b0C at the end of the century, well above the objectives of the\n\nParis Agreement, with potentially catastrophic consequences.  In  terms  of  action  levers  that  could improve  the  short-term  outlook,  the  report  focuses  on reducing methane emissions from fossil fuels, waste and the agricultural sector, as well as on the development of carbon markets.\n\nThe construction sector plays a key role in this landscape, as  it  alone  accounts  for  nearly  40%  of  annual  CO2 emissions worldwide, including 28% for the operation of buildings  (operational  emissions  related  to  heating,  air conditioning or domestic hot water) and 11% for 'gray' carbon  related  to  the  production  of  materials,  their transport, construction equipment, i.e. embodied carbon/uni00A0 (5) . There is therefore no road to carbon neutrality without  a  change  in  the  sector.  Beyond  construction projects, we must also look at existing buildings, as it is estimated that nearly two-thirds of the current stock will still  exist  and  will  continue  to  emit  carbon  in  2040/uni00A0 (6) . Decarbonization efforts must also be made here, through renovation initiatives aimed at improving energy efficiency, eliminating the use of fossil fuels (coal, gas, fuel oil) for  heating,  and  through  the  use  of  renewable energies. It was estimated, for example, as early as 2018 that to meet the objectives set by the Paris Agreement, the  energy  intensity  per  square  meter  of  buildings worldwide must improve by an average of 30% by 2030 compared to 2015/uni00A0 (7) .\n\nIn  this  context,  in  addition  to  states,  other  players  in society, and in particular companies, have a key role to play,  by  adopting  ambitious  approaches  and  setting binding targets in order to maximize their contribution and minimize their environmental footprint. In 2019, Saint-Gobain formalized its commitment to the 'Business Ambition  for  1.5\u00b0C'  initiative,  supported  by  the  United Nations Global Compact (regarding the partnership with the  Global  Compact,  see  chapter/uni00A03,  section  1.3.1).  This initiative urges business leaders to commit their companies to concrete targets aligned with limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with the ultimate goal being to support a 'truly systemic  transformation/uni00A0 (8) '. Saint-Gobain,  which  had already committed to reducing its CO2 emissions by 20% between 2010 and 2025, is now committed to achieving the objective of 'net zero emissions' by 2050. Beyond contributing  to  collectively  essential  efforts,  the  Group believes that carbon neutrality is compatible with growth and  that  a  low-carbon  economy  offers  prospects  for virtuous growth.\n\n- (1) European Union, EDGAR - Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research - https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\n- (2)  International Energy Agency, op. cit., pp./uni00A011-12.\n- (3)  Id., p./uni00A024.\n- (4)  United Nations Environment Program, EGR21: The Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On/uni00A0/ A world of climate promises not yet delivered https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021\n- (5)  https://architecture2030.org/why-the-building-sector/\n- (6)  International Energy Agency, op. cit.\n- (7)  UNEP/uni00A0/ Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction - The 2018 Global Status Report - Towards a Zero-Emission, Efficient and Resilient Buildings and Construction Sector, p./uni00A010.\n- (8)  'Join the campaign for our only future' - https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/events/climate-action-summit-2019/business-ambition",

The  solutions sold  by  the  Group  in  one  year  allow  to  reduce (1) CO2/uni00A0emissions a total of nearly 1,300/uni00A0million tons over their entire life cycle (thus exceeding by far the Group's own  carbon  footprint), by improving  the  energy efficiency of buildings  and  by  avoiding  emissions through light construction techniques. Saint-Gobain also plays a key role by helping to mobilize the entire building value chain towards a common goal of decarbonization. The Group is also working to reduce the impact of its own operations in terms of GHG emissions, in particular by constantly improving the efficiency of its processes.\n\n## Environment and use of natural 1.1.2 resources\n\nThe pressure on natural resources is increasing markedly, and yet their extraction continues to grow. The 'day of exceedance'  is  the  date  on  which  humanity's  annual demands  on  nature  (ecological  footprint)  exceeds  the Earth's capacity to regenerate natural resources over the entire year  (biocapacity).  If  this  benchmark  day  calculated by the NGO Global Footprint Network/uni00A0 (2) - was at  the  beginning  of  November  in  1980,  in  2021  it  was July/uni00A029, indicating that it would take 1.75 planet Earths to meet the current global consumption of resources without exceeding the capacity of natural regeneration. However, economic crises prove that specific actions have tangible results: as the WWF notes, 'The measures taken to deal with the pandemic have in fact pushed back the date by three weeks: the lockdown led to a reduction of the global carbon footprint of 14.5%/uni00A0 (3) '.\n\n## Number of planet Earths required to meet resource consumption (4)\n\n/uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis indicator, useful because it is symbolic, in fact only represents part of the subject of human use of natural resources on the planet's surface: it does not take into account the gradual depletion of fossil resources extracted,  and  in  particular  hydrocarbons.  At  the  same time,  it  is  estimated  that  the  consumption  of  natural resources has tripled over the last 50/uni00A0years/uni00A0 (5) . Fresh water, an essential and scarce resource (only 0.5% of the earth's water  is  usable  and  available  for  consumption)  is  a representative example of this trend: necessary for cities,\n\nagriculture, industry and energy production, since 2000 the  Earth's  fresh  water  has  been  decreasing  by  one centimeter  per  year (6) . According  to  the  latest  WMO report,  more  than  five  billion  people  will  suffer  from insufficient access to water by 2050, i.e. more than half of the  world's  population/uni00A0 (7) . Here  too,  buildings  play  an essential role, accounting for 40% of energy consumption and  also  12%  of  drinking  water  consumption,  38%  of greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  40%  of  solid  waste production/uni00A0 (8) .\n\n- (1) Evaluated in 2019.\n- (2)  Calculated by the NGO Global Footprint Network on the basis of data from sources such as the International Energy Agency or the Carbon Project.

        "page_content": "Thanks to its solutions for construction and industry, and also thanks to the improvement of its own processes, Saint-Gobain  can  and  must  respond  to  this  challenge. This will require accelerating the transition to a circular economy, taking into account the entire life cycle of its products and solutions, in order to limit their consumption of natural resources, extend their lifespan and promote their recycling, to reduce the production of non-recovered waste (see chapter/uni00A03, section 2.2).\n\n## Demographics and urbanization 1.1.3\n\nThe global population is estimated at 7.8/uni00A0billion people in 2021,  an  increase  of  1.1%  from  2015  to  2020/uni00A0 (1) ,  with  a projection of 9.7/uni00A0billion inhabitants in 2050 and 11/uni00A0billion inhabitants  in  2100/uni00A0 (2) ,  which  represents  an  increase  of more than two billion inhabitants in just thirty years ( i.e. nearly 25%).\n\nThe evolution of the age structure in developed countries is already leading to a continuous aging of the population, generating specific needs for adapting housing. This is also a  fundamental  trend  that  will  gradually  affect  other geographical  regions,  with  life  expectancy  worldwide expected to exceed 80/uni00A0years of age in 2080, compared to 72 in 2020/uni00A0 (3) .\n\nThis  rapidly  growing  global  population  has  also  been predominantly urban since 2007, with/uni00A0 (4) the urbanization rate already exceeding 80% in high and middle income countries/uni00A0 (5) . This is due not only to the creation of new towns  from  scratch,  but  also  to  the  densification  and increase  in  the  size  of  existing  cities,  often  with  old buildings.  The  number  of  mega-cities  is  expected  to increase from 33 in 2018 to 43 in 2030, an increase of almost one third in the space of twelve years.\n\nThis megatrend  is  strongly  linked  to  other  global dynamics: cities already account for more than 60% of energy and natural resources consumption, and more than 70%  of  GHG  emissions  globally.  Urban  areas  are  also particularly  exposed  to  the  consequences  of  climate change: the land on which they are built, impermeable and largely devoid of vegetation, make them vulnerable to the average increase in temperatures, the higher frequency of high  temperatures,  and  extreme  phenomena  such  as flooding. This trend towards population concentration in cities, which is mainly the result of emerging countries, was not challenged by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nRapid urbanization automatically leads to constraints and new  needs,  to  which  rapid,  sustainable  and  virtuous responses  must  be  provided.  This  concerns  access  to decent housing for all, waste management, energy supply, and also all infrastructures such as transport and collective use areas, from offices to hospitals and places used for\n\nsports, commerce or entertainment. To design current and future cities, in addition to large-scale financial investments, we must think in terms of uses and systems, exploit  data  in  an  intelligent  way,  and  incorporate  the expectations of all of society's stakeholders, anticipating future developments and natural risks; the challenge is to build  buildings  that  are  easier  to  repair,  rebuild  or dismantle. Cities need to be made resilient in the face of climate change, which requires in particular the construction of buildings that not only meet the conditions or standards that exist at the time of their delivery, but are also such that they can be adapted to the situation of their environment in 2050 and beyond.\n\nContinuous urbanization represents major growth opportunities for Saint-Gobain, as much as it reinforces its responsibility to have a positive impact. The Group has  a  central  role  to  play  in  meeting  the  needs  of affordable and sustainable construction, so that everyone  can  benefit  from  decent  housing.  It  also contributes  to  the  development  of  new,  smarter  and more  sustainable  mobility  solutions  (see  chapter/uni00A01, section 4.1.2.1).\n\n## Digitalization 1.1.4\n\nDigitalization, a phenomenon that has reached maturity in many  sectors, continues to strongly influence the development of all sectors in which Saint-Gobain operates.\n\nIn distribution , the underlying trend of constant expansion of e-commerce was further accelerated by the pandemic that began in 2020 and which led, for example, to the share of e-commerce exceeding 15% of total retail in the United States/uni00A0 (6) . Beyond the transposition of offers via digital platforms, and the attention paid to the ergonomics of websites, the challenge today is to take into account user experience in a comprehensive way and thus recreate a direct and special link between brands on the one hand and  customers  and  end  users  on  the  other,  offering  a customized  experience  to  each.  This  can  be  done  by designing offers integrating associated services; by collecting and analyzing data, while respecting privacy; by taking  into  account  all  channels  and  points  of  contact (web,  mobile,  social  networks,  or  points  of  sale).  The evolution  of  technologies  and  uses  requires  brands  to constantly  assess  trends  and  eventually  integrate  new tools  and  new  features  such  as  augmented  reality, m-commerce  or  voice  search.  Beyond  the  purely commercial relationship, the decompartmentalization brought by digital technology encourages product brands and  distribution brands  to  holistically redefine the relationship  with  all  their  stakeholders,  including  their employees, their suppliers, and the general public.\n\n- (1) United Nations Population Fund: 'World population' - https://www.unfpa.org/en/data/world-population-dashboard\n- (2)  United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs: 'World Population Prospects 2019' - https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/\n- (3)  Id.\n- (4)  United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs: 'World Urbanization Prospects 2018', p./uni00A011 https://population.un.org/wup/Publications/Files/WUP2018-Highlights.pdf\n- (5)  United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs, 'World Urbanization Prospects 2018', p./uni00A08 https://population.un.org/wup/Publications/Files/WUP2018-Highlights.pdf\n- (6)  https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec\\_current.pdf",

        "page_content": "In industry , digital tools continue to revolutionize processes and methods of organization and production. Generalized measurement, real-time data acquisition and control systems, automation, augmented operators, and the  interconnection  of  industrial  tools  give  rise  to  an ever-increasing volume of data and the ability to analyze it. After the arrival of computers and robots in factories (contributing, through their positive impact in terms of ergonomics,  to  improving  the  health  and  well-being  of employees), this fouth industrial revolution enables progress in multiple areas: increased productivity (through the reduction of inventories, breakdowns, waste of time and material); greater agility by improving the flexibility of production processes; the new possibility of customizing production; and also the minimization of the environmental  footprint of production, through  the reduction  of  waste  production,  the  optimization  of logistics  flows,  the  optimization  of  energy  and  raw material consumption, and therefore the reduction of GHG emissions.\n\nIn construction ,  digitalization  is  transforming  the  entire value chain of construction and renovation . Upstream, it is the very design (of buildings) that increasingly relies on digital  models,  or  Building  Information  Modeling  (BIM), offering  an  integrated  vision  of  the  building  during  all stages  of  its  life  cycle  through  a  'digital  twin';  on construction  sites,  3D  scanning  and  photogrammetry provide new knowledge of reality. As to construction itself, digital technology enables new operating methods such as off-site construction (prefabrication or modular construction), as well as 3D printing. Downstream, wireless monitoring, the interconnection of equipment and home automation contribute to increasing the comfort of the home, to optimizing energy consumption of buildings and to improving their safety. In transport infrastructures and high-rise buildings, the collection of real-time mass data also  enables  precise  monitoring  of  the  behavior  of structures  over  the  long  term,  predictive  analysis  and, ultimately, optimization of maintenance  and  better accident prevention, contributing to better management of the built stock throughout its life cycle.\n\nFor Saint-Gobain, digitalization is a source of progress and improvement in performance, but also a tool for the decarbonization  of  its  industrial  processes.  This  is  a fundamental issue that affects all of the Group's activities and has major impacts on customer relations, recruitment and training, the innovation process, market positioning and industrial processes themselves (see in this chapter, section 3.3.2), and on social and environmental responsibility.\n\n## Changing lifestyles 1.1.5\n\nIn Western countries, individuals spend an average of 90% of  their  time  indoors,  and  the  increase  in  work  from home (1) , following  successive  lockdowns,  has  further accentuated the phenomenon. This blurs the boundaries between  the  private  and  the  professional,  redefines expectations  with  regard  to  residential  buildings,  and feeds  the  structural  trend  of  growth  in  the  home renovation market.\n\nAs  part  of  the  quarterly  survey  carried  out  by  the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Union, to the question 'Do you intend to incur  significant  expenditure  for  the  improvement  or renovation of a property housing (\u2026) over the next twelve months?', European citizens' replied as follows:\n\n## Home renovation intentions in Europe/uni00A0 (2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-60\n\nThe entire attitude to work is being called into question, thanks partly to the digitalization of work tools, but also because of the increase in geographical mobility, societal changes  such  as  changes  in  family  structures  and  the arrival of new generations on the labor market, or workers' demands  for  a  better  work-life  balance.  In  terms  of building uses, this ties in with a more general aspiration for a better quality of life and more comfort, as defined by increasingly ambitious criteria: in addition to thermal and acoustic comfort, it is also a question of visual comfort, maximizing  access  to  natural  light,  and  air  quality, maintaining a ventilated atmosphere and free of polluting substances.\n\n- (1) Survey conducted by YouGov between April 15 and May 1st, 2019 with a panel of 16,853 adults in 14 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom) as well as the United States.\n\n2",

Globalization and the increase in living standards around the world have led to an increase in the mobility of individuals,  despite  the  limitations  brought  about  by  a crisis  such  as  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  The  demand  for decarbonization  and  the  densification  of  residential centers are also leading to changes in public transport networks, which are being strengthened and made more efficient  and  environmentally  friendly.  With  regard  to individual vehicles, the transition is now fully underway towards  models  that  emit  less  GHGs,  are  more  energy\n\nefficient and are cleaner, more comfortable, and able to interact in real time with other vehicles and with the entire environment. Beyond this technological revolution, we are witnessing an evolution of the symbolism of the car in the minds of consumers, and as a result a growing preference for  use  rather  than  possession.  This  underlying  trend, which is part of a wider social movement, has very strong concrete impacts in terms of vehicle design.\n\nFor Saint-Gobain, changing lifestyles is both an incentive to  closely  monitor  changes  in  customer  expectations, through close proximity (see chapter/uni00A03, section 3.4) and an important lever for transforming industry, construction  and  distribution.  This  supports  the  move towards more virtuous practices, particularly in terms of respect for the environment, thereby meeting its own transformation objectives.",

The renovation sector is particularly promising for growth in Europe, where it represents more than \u20ac680/uni00A0billion per year (6) . The figures accompanied by forecasts published as part of the Euroconstruct report (covering an area including Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden and Switzerland) from November/uni00A02021 show a particularly robust sector.\n\n## Size of the renovation market in Europe, 2018-2024, in millions of euros/uni00A0 (6)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Source: Oxford Economics - Saint-Gobain, Capital Markets Day, October/uni00A02021.\n- (2) High Performance Solutions.\n- (3) Expected average annual growth, weighted by the exposure of Saint-Gobain to each market.\n- (4) Sales over 12/uni00A0months at the end of June/uni00A02021.\n- (5) United Nations Environment Program-Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiatives (UNEP-SBCI): 'Building Design and Construction: Forging Resource Efficiency and Sustainable Development'.\n- (6) IHS, Euroconstruct Report, November/uni00A02021.

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\nThe Group's environment\n\nThe determined commitment of public authorities, in the context  of  the  'Green  Deal',  is  evident  in  France  for example  with  the  component  of  the  recovery  plan dedicated  to  improving  the  energy-efficiency  of  public buildings and housing, which, combined with the budget extensions  for  the  MaPrimeRenov  scheme,  amounts  to over \u20ac9/uni00A0billion (over the period 2021-2023); in Spain, with the 'Espa\u00f1a Puede' program, valued at nearly \u20ac7/uni00A0billion (over  the  period  2021-2023),  or  in  Italy  with  the 'EcoBonus' program estimated at nearly \u20ac14/uni00A0billion (over the  period  2021-2025).  This  is  a  historic  moment:  it  is estimated that 70% of residential spaces in Europe must be renovated if we want to achieve the carbon neutrality objective . However, this objective assumes that the annual rate of renovation of buildings will be doubled within ten years,  throughout  the  European  Union.  The  European Commission's strategy is to renovate 35/uni00A0million energy-inefficient  buildings  and  create  up  to  160,000 additional 'green' jobs/uni00A0 (1) in an environmental, social and efficiency-related public governance project. The priorities of the 'RenovationWave' plan are to limit energy poverty, renovate public buildings, and decarbonize heating and air conditioning/uni00A0 (2) . It should  be  noted  that  the  energy renovation support programs announced by governments do not relate exclusively to housing, but also sometimes to non-residential buildings, as in France for example.\n\nStandards  Act  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  also,  in  the United States, a series of local regulations such as the law on GHG emissions from buildings adopted in New York or the new energy code enacted by the State of California. Market  growth  is  also  driven  by adapting  buildings  to changes of use , and in particular the explosion of work from home (see above, section 1.1.5), which has consequences  in  terms  of  renovation  and  restructuring needs for both individual housing and office buildings. The increase  in  the  number  of  real  estate  transactions in Western Europe (1.2/uni00A0million in France/uni00A0 (3) ) is another factor driving market growth, as changes in ownership are often an opportunity to carry out work. The same logic is at play with the upward trend in the ownership rate in certain countries (France, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands for  example)  and  with  renewed  consumer  interest  in second  homes,  under  the  influence  of  populations choosing to leave major cities; the latter trend has the additional effect of increasing the geographical dispersion of renovation needs, which has an impact on demand in terms of distribution channels for products and services.\n\nThe  sector's  growth  outlook  is  also  supported  by the constant strengthening of construction and renovation standards in developed  economies,  with  increasingly demanding standards such as the Climate Act 2020 in France, the European Directive on the energy performance of buildings, the Minimum Energy Efficiency\n\nThe  necessary  adaptation  of  housing  to  an aging population is also one of the factors that make renovation a market with strong and sustainable structural growth over several decades. The proportion of the population aged 65 and over is expected to double between 2019 and 2050  in  many  regions  of  the  world:  North  Africa  and Western Asia, Central and South Asia, East and South East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. By 2050, one in four people living in Europe and North America could be 65 or older.\n\n## Growth projections for the global population aged 65 and over in absolute terms (in millions of people), 2020-2100/uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) European Commission, Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP\\_20\\_1835.\n\n- (3)  France: cumulative over 12 rolling months in November/uni00A02021.",

They also bring benefits in terms of well-being , thanks to improved thermal, acoustic and visual comfort. The penetration of this construction method is high because it responds to challenges both in developed countries (pressure on natural resources, search for productivity and lack of labor for professionals, expectations of modularity and environmental responsibility on the part of end users) and in emerging countries (benefits in terms of speed of construction, housing needs created by population growth). Its growth will therefore exceed that of the construction sector as a whole, offering particularly significant sources of value.\n\n## Sustainable mobility 1.2.2\n\nThe mobility market is influenced by long-term dynamics. The automotive sector as a whole will grow , with production of light vehicles set to increase by 9.5% in average over 2022-2024, marking a return to normal after the sharp decline recorded in 2020 and the stagnation of 2021. Electric vehicles, in which Saint-Gobain holds leading positions, will account for most of this growth. As a result, in particular, of changes in standards, the spread of restrictions imposed by metropolitan areas, and the continuation of government subsidy programs, electric vehicles are expected to represent around 50% of the market by 2030 in most developed countries (Western Europe, United Kingdom, Japan) and China, and around 40% in Brazil and India (3) . There has been a sharp acceleration in the electrification of the vehicle fleet with the announcement by the European Commission of a target of 100% sales of electric cars by 2035. All car manufacturers have since positioned themselves in relation to this deadline, by announcing their own roadmap for the electrification of their range. The 'Fit for 55' strategy published by the Commission also provides for changes in the taxation of fuels and the deployment of charging infrastructure for vehicles. Consequently, we are witnessing a veritable explosion in the electric vehicle\n\nmarket on the continent, with an annual volume of 6.4/uni00A0million expected for 2021, which would represent a growth of 98% year on year.\n\n- (1) IHS, September/uni00A02021.\n- (2) IHS, September/uni00A02021.

For its part, the air transport market, which has withstood the consequences of the pandemic, notably thanks to massive aid, estimated at more than $240/uni00A0billion/uni00A0 (2) ,  is  not  expected  to  return  to  a  level  of demand comparable to the pre-crisis situation before late 2023/uni00A0/ early 2024. However, it remains a promising market with  very  strong  medium  and  long-term  growth,  with negligible impact of the crisis on the need for new aircraft by 2040, estimated at more than 43,000 aircraft, doubling the global fleet of commercial aircraft/uni00A0 (3) .\n\n## Sustainable industry 1.2.3\n\nGlobal  industrial  production  is  expected  to grow  more than 3% per year over the decade 2020-2030/uni00A0 (4) . In this positive context, all segments of this business sector are gradually moving towards the decarbonization of their operations in general and their industrial processes in particular , which requires massive financial investments. By way of illustration, around one third of the thousand largest  European  listed  companies  (including  industrial Groups)  have  made  commitments  regarding  carbon neutrality  by  2050/uni00A0 (5) . The  industrial  decarbonization market could therefore grow faster than the industry as a whole.\n\nSome  of  the  segments  in  which  Saint-Gobain  is positioned should experience faster growth for example, the health sector. Health  spending,  driven  by  the megatrends of the aging of the population, the growing demand  for  healthcare,  the  average  increase  in  living standards on a global scale, and the expansion of public healthcare  systems,  is  expected  to  grow  4%  over  the period 2020-2024/uni00A0 (6) .\n\n- (1) Virta Global - https://www.virta.global/global-electric-vehicle-market.

The Group is convinced that consideration of the common good, ethics and social and societal issues is an essential factor in generating sustainable growth.\n\nIn 2020 the Group unveiled its purpose: 'Making the world a better home'. The manifesto associated with this purpose clearly states the involvement of stakeholders and the desire to act with them (see chapter/uni00A01, section 2.2.1).\n\n## Management of relations 1.3.1 with stakeholders\n\nFor Saint-Gobain, the interests of all of its stakeholders must be taken into account when defining its long-term strategy. First of all this involves building dialogue, and also ensuring that this dialogue is transparent and based on mutual trust.\n\nFactors such as the size of the Group, its global dimension and the variety of its business lines mean that dialogue must, above all, be organized in a decentralized manner, with each operational entity being responsible for conducting it within its own scope.\n\nSaint-Gobain has mapped its ecosystem, identifying and grouping its stakeholders by category (see illustration below). For each category, a Group function responsible for organizing the reporting of information on its expectations, at local or global level, and producing a summary of them, has been designated as the contact point.

Mapping of its stakeholders, Saint-Gobain identified priority issues and  carried  out  a  materiality  matrix, i.e. a  graphic representation of the importance of these issues, based on the  expectations  of  stakeholders  and  the  vision  of  the Group's management teams.\n\nThe  materiality  matrix  published  by  Saint-Gobain  was reviewed in 2020 with the help of Mazars. The following methodological principles have been adopted:\n\nLEVEL 1\n\nLEVEL 2\n\nLEVEL 3\n\n- identify  priority  issues,  based  on  the  documentation /uni25A0 available on the Group, its activities and its environment;\n- share these issues with its main stakeholders; /uni25A0\n- prioritize these issues by  comparing  stakeholder /uni25A0 expectations against the vision of management.\n\nA methodology note is available on the Group website. The assessment is based on information gathered during interviews  with  experts,  customer  surveys,  employee surveys, minutes of meetings with various stakeholders, and  internal  interviews.  For  example,  interviews  with external  stakeholders  conducted  in  the  context  of  the Group's purpose  or  the  'me@Saint-Gobain'  survey conducted among Group employees were included in the analysis, as were the Group's transformations as part of the 'Transform & Grow' program in 2019-2020.\n\nVISION OF GROUP MANAGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

The Group aims to continue its growth and become leader in most of its markets,  by  outperforming  its  competitors.  This ambition implies, through its values, actions and commitments, transforming  the  market  and  guiding change, becoming a reference for all its stakeholders : its employees, its professional customers in the construction and  industrial  sectors,  its  end  consumers,  regulators  or local communities, the media and citizens. Being a leader also means being a pioneer and paving the way for others, constantly innovating with and for the entire ecosystem in which Saint-Gobain operates.\n\nThe Group's value proposition is reflected in the marketing of alternative solutions to traditional construction, through lighter products and construction methods that are both more  sustainable  and  more  efficient, minimizing  the footprint of  Saint-Gobain's  operations  (notably  through the  reduction  of  CO2  emissions  in  logistics  flows  and industrial processes, or the reduction in the consumption\n\nof natural resources and the production of waste) while maximizing  its  virtuous  impact across  the  entire  value chain (for example by reducing GHG emissions over the entire  life  cycle  of  its  solutions,  by  making  it  easier  to modify, dismantle or repurpose buildings, and by allowing gains  in  all  types  of  comfort,  or  by  increasing  the productivity of the Group's customers and all professionals).\n\nSaint-Gobain's continued growth is achieved through the 'Grow & Impact' strategic plan announced at the end of 2021 (see in this chapter, section 2). It is based on solid foundations : meeting the objectives of the 'Transform & Grow'  plan  over  the  period  2019-2020  had  helped transform  the  Group  into  an  organization  focused  on speed and rapid execution, thanks to a simplified structure and governance, focusing on the local level, with faster decision-making processes and the systematic promotion of a culture of trust and collaboration (see in this chapter, section 3.5). Saint-Gobain is now  also a clearly customer-oriented Group: this is reflected in the focus on customer experience.\n\nCapitalizing on this momentum, Saint-Gobain has objectives for the period 2021-2025/uni00A0 (1) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                   | 2021-2025   | Previous years   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Organic growth                    | 3 to 5%     | ~ 1.5%           |\n| Operating margin                  | 9 to 11%    | ~ 7%             |\n| Return on capital employed (ROCE) | 12 to 15%   | ~ 10%            |\n\nThese initiatives serve an ambition that translates into long-term objectives concerning the Group's market position:\n\n## Saint-Gobain's long-term objectives in terms of geographic exposure (as a percentage of Group sales)\n\nEmerging countries\n\n25%\n\nNorth America\n\n## Western Europe\n\n20%\n\n55%\n\n## Saint-Gobain's long-term objectives in terms of markets (as a percentage of Group sales)\n\nLocal\n\nGlobal\n\n80%\n\n20%\n\n2",

In  the  field  of  light  construction,  the solutions proposed by the Group (more than 40% of its current  sales) form  a  complete  range , from  fa\u00e7ade solutions to ceilings, including insulation, cladding, lightweight  structures,  as  well  as  pre-assembly  and prefabrication. Saint-Gobain's high performance solutions meet  the  growing  needs  of  the  market  in  terms  of decarbonization of construction and industrial processes, also improving the performance of electric vehicles. All of these markets are accelerating and are sources of growth for Saint-Gobain.\n\nThe European  markets , through  their  maturity,  offer prospects  for large-scale deployment  of  innovative approaches such as the search for solutions in favor of circularity, through the reduction of the use of virgin raw materials, the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations  (50%  of  countries  on  the  continent  have already increased their taxes on waste since 2018, or plan to increase it), or the use of retail chains as an essential link in the waste treatment chain.\n\nThe particularly high environmental sensitivity of European consumers also promotes advances such as the growing use  of  bio-sourced  materials,  innovative  construction methods and carbon-neutral industrial processes. Off-site manufacturing, which is expected to grow by almost 10% per year over the next decade in the UK, is also a source of excellent market opportunities. It is able to meet the needs in  terms  of  building  renovation  (which  accounted  for nearly  two-thirds  of  the  Group's  revenue  in  Europe  in 2021), reducing the environmental impact of the building\n\nsector, productivity and protecting the health of professionals. Renovation is the first strategic priority on the continent for the construction sector, under the aegis of ambitious  action  plans  developed  by  countries, coordinated  by  the  European  Commission.  In  order  to achieve the targets for reducing GHG emissions by 55% by 2030,  the  EU  as  a  whole  needs  to  reduce  the  GHG emissions of buildings by 60%, their energy consumption by 14%, and the consumption of energy for heating and cooling  by  18%.  Until  now,  only  1%  of  buildings  have undergone energy renovation every year/uni00A0 (1) . The 'Renovation  Wave'  plan  (see  above,  section  1.2.1.1) illustrates  this  strong  trend,  which  makes  renovation  a structurally growing market for several decades to come.\n\nSaint-Gobain has pursued on the continent its investment and  portfolio  management  strategy  focused  on  value creation, notably with the acquisition of Br\u00fcggemann, a leading player in Germany,  thus  strengthening  its capabilities as a leader in light construction in Europe; with the construction of new plasterboard production lines in Romania,  Norway  and  Spain;  with  the  acquisition  of  a specialist in adhesives in Romania; or with the acquisition of specialized distributors in France, to complement its existing offering. The Group deploys all the strength of its offering  to  make  the  most  of  the  opportunities  in  this region.  For  example,  this  results  in  the  marketing  of  a complete  series  of  solutions  for  the  renovation  of single-family homes (33 products and services), enabling long-term efficiency objectives (with a 70% reduction in energy  costs),  progress  in  all aspects  of  comfort (acoustics,  lighting  and  air  quality  in  particular),  and  a saving  of  almost  275/uni00A0tonnes  of  CO2  equivalent  emitted over  50/uni00A0years per  housing  unit.  In  the  case  of  the construction of a new residential building, no less than 21 products and services are offered by the Group through all its brands, thus allowing considerable progress in terms of circularity (with 60% of recycled materials and dismantling possible up to 90%) or construction time (with a saving of three  months,  thanks  to  off-site  timber  construction). Thanks  to  the  reorganization  of  its  market  approach (notably  through  the  creation  of  joint  prescription  and sales teams), its proximity to its customers (through nearly 3,500/uni00A0points  sales  outlets  in  Europe,  combined  with  a multi-channel  approach),  and  its  innovation  approach, Saint-Gobain forecasts organic growth of between 3 and 4% and an increase in its operating margin of 7 to 9% across the continent for the 2021 to 2025 period.",

        "page_content": "On the North American markets (10.8% of the Group's revenue, with more than 16,000/uni00A0employees and more than 60 plants), there is a structural demand for more housing, fueled by demographic  trends  and  new  end-user expectations, resulting in a current deficit of nearly four million housing units/uni00A0 (1) . This powerful, long-term trend has a very strong impact on the market, given that almost half of construction sales in the region concern light residential construction products and systems. The segment for the construction  of  a  new  single-family  house,  in  which Saint-Gobain offers the largest range of systems (24 glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> products  and  services  in  total)  on  the  continent,  is therefore of particular importance in the context of the Group's  'solutions-oriented'  approach  (see  chapter/uni00A03, section 3.4.4). In a context of near full employment, this trend  is  leading  to  labor  shortages  for  nearly  40%  of employers  in  the  sector,  which  greatly  increases  the demand  and  attractiveness of light, intuitive and easy-to-install construction solutions, thus enabling these companies to save time and improve their productivity. Saint-Gobain's stated objective is to leverage its leading position in this key market (more than $5/uni00A0billion in revenue for the Group in 2021)/uni00A0 (2) to exploit its full growth potential, in particular by relying on the very strong recognition of its brands (CertainTeed is the preferred brand of builders and  private  individuals),  or  on  the  strengthening  of  its capacities in gypsum,  with  the  acquisition  of  the Continental  Building  Products  brand  in  2020/uni00A0 (3) . The acquisition of Chryso in 2021 is a significant step forward, enabling Saint-Gobain to consolidate its leading position in this region (see chapter/uni00A01, section 3.1).\n\nIn Latin America (more  than  13,000  Saint-Gobain employees and 55 plants in nine countries), demand is not weakening, particularly in the residential market for the middle classes, whether in terms of new construction or renovation,  with  increasing  expectations  regarding  the decarbonization of the sector and  more  generally regarding responsible offerings: nearly the half of consumers on the continent are ready to pay a higher price in exchange for sustainable solutions/uni00A0 (4) . Thanks to the systematization of synergies throughout the region, and the commitment of the teams to the reorientation of the  Group  as  a  solution  provider  (notably  through  the consolidation of logistics flows, the creation of multi-brand sales teams, and the launch of integrated offers for vertical markets such as schools, hospitals and offices), Saint-Gobain continues to make strong progress on the continent,  with  estimated  organic  revenue  growth  of\n\n42.5% between 2019 and 2021. The Group is continuing its development strategy to strengthen its positions on the continent,  with  the  construction  of  a  new  plasterboard production  line  in  Brazil,  or  with  the  acquisition  of  a leading  player  in  the  construction  chemicals  market  in Mexico.  In  the  Americas  as  a  whole,  for  the  period 2021-2025 the Group is targeting an increase of 4 to 6% in its organic growth and by 13 to 15% in its operating margin over the period.\n\nAsia-Pacific (more than 17,000 Saint-Gobain employees, with 72 plants in 11/uni00A0countries), for its part, is particularly influenced by megatrends linked to demography (60% of the world population), urbanization (over 50% of the total population  live  in  cities)  and  the  average  rise  in  living standards:  the  continent  is  now  home  to  the  largest middle class in the world. It is also a massively digitalized continent with a forecast for 2025 of nearly three billion mobile Internet users and an e-commerce market of two trillion dollars. In this demanding context of growth, in a region also marked by often difficult weather conditions (and in particular a high average humidity level), and by shortages of qualified labor, expectations regarding the construction  market  essentially  focus  on  two  elements: speed and quality of execution. In this market, the Group deploys  its  integrated  solutions  for  the  construction  of new  offices,  as  well  as  for  individual  or  collective residential  buildings,  and  on  the  digitalization  of  its offering.  Operational  excellence  delivered  by  its  teams (see chapter/uni00A03, section 3) maximizes its contribution to the creation of value for its customers (with, for example, a 76%  reduction  in  installation  time  during  construction, nearly  2,000  hours  of  on-site  training  provided,  an average gain in luminosity of over 25% for office buildings) while reducing the impact on the entire value chain (nearly 14/uni00A0kt of CO2 equivalent emission prevented over 50/uni00A0years). In the case of India alone, the deployment of shared data collection  and  processing  solutions,  the  creation  of  a strong  digital resource  platform  (for  example  with 1,400/uni00A0employees  in  the  IT  Department  alone),  and  the opening of nearly 30 new plants between 2001 and 2021 (notably in China, with a new plasterboard plant, and in Malaysia,  with  its  28th/uni00A0plant  in  South-East  Asia),  have enabled  Saint-Gobain  to  achieve  brand  awareness  of nearly 70% and a market share of over 50% in glass and gypsum. The Group aims to achieve organic growth of 8 to 10% and an increase of 13 to 15% in its operating margin between 2021 and 2025 for the entire region.\n\n- (1) Freddie Mac, 2021 report, https://www.freddiemac.com/perspectives/sam-khater/20210415-single-family-shortage.\n- (2)  On a rolling 12-month basis, calculated at the end of June/uni00A02021.\n- (3)  Saint-Gobain, Group press release, https://www.Saint-Gobain.com/sites/Saint-Gobain.com/files/20200130\\_continental\\_vf.pdf.\n- (4)  Nielsen, https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/latam-pockets-of-growth-report-june-2017.pdf.\n\n2",

This approach, which represents a major differentiating factor for Saint-Gobain, is implemented in several areas:\n\n- developing  cross-selling  and  specialized  channels,  in /uni25A0 particular through vertical market solutions, thanks to joint sales forces mastering a whole portfolio of brands, thanks to training services for professional customers and  end-consumers,  or  thanks  to  specialized  sales channels;\n- offering  systems, i.e. a  combination  of  products  and /uni25A0 services which guarantee a given technical performance and often combine benefits in terms of sustainable  development  and  productivity.  This  is particularly  the  case  for  prefabrication,  lightweight fa\u00e7ades, partition systems, building science, high-performance systems, exterior insulation systems (ETICS), and connected glazing solutions;\n- offering services, and thus ever more options to the /uni25A0 Group's customers across the entire value chain. This is notably the case in the field of shared logistics and kitting  services,  intermediation  platforms,  after-sales services, automated warehouses, recycling services and digital solutions.\n\nThanks  to  this  approach,  Saint-Gobain  strengthens  its competitive advantage by offering integrated offers for a wide  range  of  situations, from  the  renovation  of single-family  homes,  hospitals,  schools,  and  collective housing, to the construction of new offices and collective and individual housing, green mobility and the decarbonization of industry.\n\n## Accelerating growth through innovation and/uni00A0digital/uni00A0tools 3.3\n\n## Putting the customer 3.3.1 at the heart of innovation\n\n## Cultivating proximity with 3.3.1.1 the Group's customers\n\nProximity to its customers is the foundation of Saint-Gobain's innovation approach. Knowing professionals  better  means  better  understanding  their specific expectations, making  it  easier to charting innovation ,  which  helps  to  identify  opportunities  more quickly for the Group to deliver value, reduce time-to-market  and  optimize  return  on  investment.  For architects  and  engineers,  this  means  technical  support, ease of collaboration, and ease of testing new products and solutions; for craftsmen and building contractors, this involves the supply of products and materials, access to distribution sites, ease of installation, advice on installation, and project management support; for developers, this is the total cost of ownership, on-time delivery, and advice to help anticipate changes in standards; for owners and occupants  of  buildings,  this  concerns  in  particular  the multiple dimensions of comfort, customization, maintenance costs and property prices. In addition to the diversity of business sectors and client businesses, it is also the diversity of situations and expectations in each geographical region that must be taken into account. This is why Saint-Gobain's eight cross-functional R&D centers are  deployed  all  over  the  world  (France,  Germany,  the\n\nUnited States, China, India, Brazil), as close as possible to local situations.\n\nIf customer  knowledge  is  acquired  in  particular  by managing  the  customer  relationship,  collecting  and analyzing data (see in this chapter, section 3.3), innovation seen through the prism of co-development is carried out through a full range of tools and initiatives: deployment of training and methodologies, investments in test benches, development of real or virtual prototyping resources to accelerate  customer  validation,  and  creation  of  specific locations. 'Design thinking' approaches and user experience in the development of new products, systems and services are also deployed in the various R&D centers.\n\nAs a result, the R&D teams are able to run scenarios for the use of different prototypes and to evaluate, modify and  propose  solutions  that  meet  the  expectations  of customers in the mobility or construction markets. The determined response that Saint-Gobain has given to the consequences  of  the  pandemic  has  proven  that  this priority given to customer relationship can be satisfactorily and  productively  maintained  through  digital  initiatives such as virtual tours, real-time and remote brainstorming, or virtual and augmented reality.\n\nFinally, teams of building science specialists, present in the various  R&D  centers  around  the  world,  are  working  to continuously improve comfort for end users and the ease of installation for craftsmen, and also to reduce total cost of ownership for building owners.",

        "page_content": "## Placing innovation at the heart 3.3.1.2 of Saint-Gobain's model\n\nThe Group has consistently placed research and innovation at the heart of its strategy. Nearly 400 patents are filed every year by Saint-Gobain. This approach covers all of Saint-Gobain's activities, from off-site construction to innovative types of glass - such as electrochromic glass for  buildings  and  vehicles  -  to  solar  roof  panels,  light construction,  laboratories  dedicated  to  research  on  the use  of  residential  areas,  3-D  printing  and  innovation regarding services.\n\nThe reorganization of Saint-Gobain enables the innovation process to move away from a silo approach, freeing up strong synergies across the Group. In 2021 there are over 20 common global platforms, shared by the business lines targeting  industrial  customers  and  those  targeting  the construction markets, which structure innovation to offer systems and solutions in areas such as specialty materials, sustainable development or digital tools. The centrality of innovation for Saint-Gobain is also reflected in the creation of an innovation department bringing together research and development, corporate marketing and expertise in the innovation process, a department overseen by a Chief Innovation Officer reporting directly to the Group Chief Executive Officer.\n\nSaint-Gobain's efforts focus on research-based innovation, particularly  in  terms  of  products  and  manufacturing processes,  but  they  also  apply  to  other  fields,  such  as innovation in business models and in services. They are guided by several priority areas:\n\nFor construction markets innovation relates in particular to dynamic and intelligent building materials, as well as advanced technologies such as prefabrication and robotization. Construction solutions through three-dimensional printing (a technology already deployed by  the  Group  in  the  Netherlands  with  the  support  of Saint-Gobain  Research  Paris,  which  has  applications  in residential, industrial and infrastructure sectors) minimize the use of materials, enable more advanced customization possibilities,  and  an  80%  faster  construction  process. Composite exterior thermal insulation systems, installed on lightweight fa\u00e7ade frames, combine within the Group the expertise of the construction trades and those of High Performance Solutions. They allow the amount of CO2 to be divided between two and four compared to concrete wall  solutions,  and  represent  a  weight  saving  of  85% compared  to  traditional  walls,  with  the  corresponding gains in terms of speed and safety during installation.\n\nFor mobility ,  innovation  helps  improve  vehicle  comfort (noise,  vibration,  aerodynamics,  thermal  comfort,  etc.), reduces the overall weight of the vehicle, and enables the development of new features and uses in terms of safety, information  and  entertainment.  Lightweight  windows allow a 4% increase in the range of electric vehicles. In industry ,  the  objective  is  to  innovate  in  manufacturing processes in order to reduce their environmental footprint, for  example  the  transition  to  low-carbon  energy,  heat recovery,  or  the  design  of  'zero  carbon'  plants;  in distribution , for example, we are talking about the design of integrated services for craftsmen or project managers and project owners, in construction or renovation projects.\n\n## Capitalizing on Saint-Gobain's diversity, 3.3.1.3 involving all employees\n\nInnovation  is  one  of  the  five  'Attitudes',  pillars  of  the management  culture  of  Saint-Gobain  (see  chapter/uni00A03, section 4.1.1). Being open-minded and thinking outside the box, taking original paths, questioning practices inherited from the past to suggest and experiment with new ones: these are some of the skills valued for all Saint-Gobain's employees.  Saint-Gobain  therefore  sees  innovation  as both  an  objective  and  a  way  of  bringing  the  entire organization  together  around  a  common  mindset,  by aiming to:\n\n- create the conditions for creativity by encouraging the /uni25A0 permanent detection of opportunities to solve problems encountered by the Group's customers and respond to them with new solutions;\n- relearn  the  processes  that  facilitate  creativity;  the /uni25A0 challenge here is to give freedom to divergent thinking, while  remaining  focused  on  the  rapid  production  of results, in an agile manner;\n- explore all innovation pathways, not only the initiatives /uni25A0 conducted by research and development and marketing teams, but also intrapreneurship approaches and  collaboration  with  external  entities  (companies, public  organizations,  or  research  structures)  in  an atmosphere of co-development and open innovation.\n\n## Approaching innovation in ecosystem 3.3.1.4 mode: open innovation and co-innovation\n\nTo complement its in-house capabilities, Saint-Gobain has been deploying its innovative approach through exchanges  and  partnerships  around  the  world  with  its customers and suppliers, with an ecosystem of start-ups and via scientific collaborations and partnerships with the academic world.\n\n## Scientific and academic cooperation\n\nThe  SUN  international  network  of  universities  is  the framework  for long-term  academic  collaboration that provide access to the most recent scientific advances in the  fields  of  interest  to  the  Group  and  to  a  breeding ground of young talent.\n\nMore  specifically,  this  leads  to  the  establishment  of partnerships with various institutions in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence .\n\n## Open innovation and cooperation with start-ups\n\nThrough  NOVA,  a  unique  structure  created  in  2006, Saint-Gobain plays an active role within the global start-up ecosystem. NOVA aims to enable disruptive innovation by identifying opportunities for long-term partnerships and turning these into a reality. It also favour the development of new ideas and business models.\n\n2",

It also provides targeted support to Saint-Gobain teams working on industrial markets such as mobility - in particular on autonomous vehicles - and life sciences./uni00A0\n\nExamples include:\n\n- AMT  (United  Kingdom),  a  start-up  implementing /uni25A0 post-processing of 3D printed polymer components;\n- Fibrecoat  (Germany),  developing  new  fiber-based /uni25A0 products for the aerospace industry;\n- InDeco (China), deploying an efficient office renovation /uni25A0 service thanks to digital design;\n- Hyperframe, proposing a metal framing system for the /uni25A0 construction of commercial buildings;\n- Juundo (Belgium), developing reusable steel framewall /uni25A0 systems;\n- LivSpace  (India),  specialising  in  the  optimisation  of /uni25A0 office spaces;\n- Tri'n'Collect  (France),  offering  recycling  services  for /uni25A0 construction waste that complement NOVA's previous investment in EcoDrop.\n\n## Sourcing deals via multiple contact points\n\nInitiating relationships with startups takes place in many different ways: via VC investors, incubators, accelerators, but  also  through  NOVA's  involvement  in  key  events (ranging from Climatetech Summit in the United States to the Africarena startup challenge in South Africa and the CSRtech Summit in China). Internal stakeholders also play a more and more significant role, showcasing a shift in Saint-Gobain's corporate culture: more often than not, the NOVA team is nowadays introduced to start-ups by local business teams, as was the case in India with LivSpace.\n\n## Deploying various collaboration patterns\n\nNOVA works with Saint-Gobain teams to set up strategic co-development partnerships , distribution or marketing agreements , or licensing agreements with start-ups. Since the end of 2016, NOVA has extended its field of expertise by acquiring equity stakes in start-ups . The latter can take several forms: initial investment; follow-up investment in a company  in  which  NOVA  already  has  a  position;  and investing  via  a  fund  rather  than  directly.  The  total\n\ninvestment value of NOVA in start-ups to date amounts to around USD 100 million (at fair market value price). NOVA focuses  on  seed,  pre-seed,  and  early  stage  investment: Hyperframe,  a  start-up  which  has  developed  a  metal framing  system  for  commercial  buildings  construction, only was a 2-person company when the relationship with Saint-Gobain was incepted via an acceleration programme with Greentown Labs, a Massachussets-based climatetech community and incubator that brings together startups, corporates, investors, politicians, and others.\n\n## Scaling up: a growing momentum\n\nThe  progressive  ramp-up  of  NOVA's  operations  has allowed to build an impressive funnel which led to 1,500 projects being screened in 2021, more than 600 reaching the  stage  of  'active  deals',  and  around  50  projects (including new direct investments, follow-on investments, new fund investments, and joint development/ commercial agreements) closed during the year, after due diligence and final negotiation.\n\n## Investing via dedicated funds\n\nNOVA  is  also  a  limited  partner  in  investment  funds targeted for the Group's business lines and geographical regions:  Navitas  Capital  for  construction  and  Phoenix Venture Partners (PVP) for material sciences, both in the United  States,  and  Environmental  Technologies  Fund (ETF)  in  Europe,  focusing  on  sustainable  development. NOVA also has invested in a new venture fund in China, Richland  Capital,  with  a  focus  on  high  performance solutions.\n\n## Partnering with incubators\n\nTo support its approach, Saint-Gobain has partnered with several incubators through NOVA. These include:\n\n- Greentown  Labs  in  the  United  States,  specialising  in /uni25A0 green  technologies,  which  opened  a  second  site  in Texas in 2021;\n- Impulse Labs in France, which specialises in /uni25A0 construction businesses;\n- Cubo in Brazil, a specialist in digitisation; /uni25A0\n- RWTH  Aachen  University  in  Germany,  a  prestigious /uni25A0 engineering school that integrates an excellent start-up incubator called RWTH Innovation;\n- Tus-Holdings in China, a company that develops, builds, /uni25A0 and  manages  TusPark,  the  largest  university  science park in the world;\n- Also  in  China,  the  Impact  Hub  Innovation  Center  in /uni25A0 Shanghai.\n\n## Investing in innovation: a token of Saint-Gobain's trust in a more open world\n\nWhatever  the  form  of  collaboration  with  startups, Saint-Gobain's  philosophy  is  based  on  three  values:  an approach  that  benefits  all  stakeholders;  a  passion  for learning  and  researching  new  ideas;  and  an  open  and flexible approach to relationships. NOVA also acts as a portal to the outside world , helping to connect internal teams  with  new  ways  of  working  and  with  innovation produced outside the Group.",

        "page_content": "## An internal venturing approach\n\nSaint-Gobain encourages the intrapreneurial dynamic of its teams , with the goal of promoting the development and sharing of ideas to create new business opportunities and new initiatives by combining the Group's strengths with a mindset  and  methodologies  closer  to  the functioning of a start-up.\n\nThe internal venturing approach is structured around the InPulse program, launched in Brazil in 2017 and replicated in most regions. The most promising ideas put forward by employees benefit from Group support, notably via access to  open  source  training  materials,  and  give  rise  to acceleration  and  financing  initiatives.  Recent  examples include a low-cost machinery and spare parts plant (via a team in Turkey), 'tiny house' kits (via a team in Brazil) and a  digital  solution  for  the  collection  and  deposit  of construction  waste  in  recycling  centers  (via  a  team  in France). The idea is also to systematically promote within the teams constant adaptation to fast-moving changes, to develop the ability to experiment, to adjust, and to apply resilience and tenacity.\n\n## Leveraging innovation to improve 3.3.1.5 environmental performance\n\nThrough  the  generalization  of  eco-innovation  practices ( i.e. the design of solutions with minimized impacts and optimized  benefits  for  the  environment  and  health), innovation is also ultimately emerging as an essential way of  achieving  Saint-Gobain's  objectives  in  the  area  of sustainable development on all measurement scopes: on the  Group's  operations,  but  also  on  the  upstream  and downstream  part  of  the  value  chain.  Resulting  from innovation in construction chemistry, new  adhesive mortars offered by Saint-Gobain enable, for example, a 46% reduction in CO2 emitted, a 28% reduction in water consumption, and a 25% reduction in use of raw materials compared to comparable products; still in construction, the  Adfors  and  Chryso  entities  offer  decarbonization solutions to global players in the sector. This approach applies  to  all  of  the  Group's  activities  and  industrial processes: the first zero-carbon plasterboard plant will be operational in Norway in 2023, a concrete demonstration of the commitment made by Saint-Gobain to reduce its CO2 emissions (scopes/uni00A01 and 2) by 33% by 2030 compared to 2017, with a focus on carbon neutrality by 2050. For its industrial  customers,  Sefpro  and  Norton  offer  specialty materials for decarbonizing manufacturing processes. In the field of mobility, brands such as Sekurit and Norseal are marketing solutions that improve the energy efficiency of electric vehicles.\n\n## Example: the virtuous impact of innovation on GHG emissions throughout the construction and renovation value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor a detailed representation of the entire Saint-Gobain value chain, see chapter/uni00A03, section 3.1. For a complete overview of the points of contact between the links in the Group's value chain and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), see/uni00A0Saint-Gobain's integrated report/uni00A0 (1) .\n\n## Unleashing the power of digital technology through data collection and use 3.3.2\n\nAs we have seen, digital technology impacts all business sectors in which Saint-Gobain operates (see, in this chapter, section 1.1.4). The Group approaches this subject as a lever for progress and performance improvement, and also as a cross-functional challenge, which concerns both its internal operations (industrial processes, management, employee engagement), its relations with its suppliers, its customers and other stakeholders, as well as its social and environmental responsibility. It is for this reason that a new Group Digital and Information Systems Department was created in 2021, led by a Chief Digital and Information Officer reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer of Saint-Gobain. It should be noted  that  the  specific  needs,  constraints  and  challenges  related  to  digital  technology,  as  well  as  the  level  of sophistication of the initiatives undertaken in this area, vary greatly depending on the Group's activities.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe action: a strategic plan based on/uni00A0six/uni00A0priorities\n\nThe digital revolution's fuel is data. Data is a 21st/uni00A0century gold mine, and the efforts of all the Group's teams are now focused on the collection, understanding, and analysis of it. This is the key to Saint-Gobain's transformation into a solution provider, thanks to the in-depth knowledge of customers provided by the multiple points of contact between them and the Group throughout the value chain, and the mass of data they generate.\n\n## Saint-Gobain has an unrivalled number of points of contact with its customers throughout its value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo achieve this, Saint-Gobain is reinventing its methods, in particular  by  bringing  in  an  ever-growing  number  of talents in software engineering and data expertise, or by deploying agile approaches through the testing of local solutions in proof of concept mode, some of which will then be rolled out over larger areas.\n\n## Data and customer relationship 3.3.2.1\n\nIn the retail sector, Saint-Gobain's digital platforms enable rapid digitalization of interactions with customers. This has significantly changed the structure of commercial relationships, with, for example, a three-fold increase in revenue generated through multi-channel marketing, and a 9% increase in the average shopping basket for the Dahl DK brand between 2019 and 2020; and an 18% increase in new customers for the French retail brand Point.P. All of the Group's distribution brands are progressing towards an increasingly high share of online sales, reaching up to 100% in China. The deployment of advanced data analysis tools based on artificial intelligence - which allow a better understanding  of  the  customer  and  therefore  greater proximity to them - also enabled an increase in sales for the French retailers of Saint-Gobain as well as a profit margin improvement of 0.9/uni00A0points for five of the Group's distribution entities in France.\n\nIn terms of the production of construction solutions, the implementation  of  customer  relationship  management (CRM)  tools  enables  integration  at  all  levels  of  the relationship.  For  example,  glass  fa\u00e7ade  project  data  is managed, and also shared internationally via a database that allows tracking of 6,000/uni00A0projects worldwide. Data can also  be  shared  between  different  entities  to  improve customer  relations,  and  also  operational  excellence:  in India,  a  common  database  of  eight  Saint-Gobain  local entities makes it possible to share information across the board.\n\n## Digital technology and supplier relations 3.3.2.2\n\nDigital technology is also changing the way we interact with suppliers. Digitizing supplier processes means centralizing and automating the Purchasing Department.\n\nTraditional  tasks  have  been  automated  by  means  of electronic auctions, with the use of online tools. Campaigns to monitor suppliers' e-reputation have also been  undertaken,  with  significant  outcomes,  to  identify potential problems and promote a policy of responsible purchasing.\n\n## 3D, a driver of acceleration and 3.3.2.3 performance\n\n3D  continues  to  grow  across  all  Saint-Gobain  Business Units: it is now deployed on more than four continents, in the glass business as well as those dedicated to mobility, insulation, roofing and fa\u00e7ades. The unique ability offered by three-dimensional visualization to model the properties and structure of the most complex materials, combined with  data  science  to  boost  the  marketing  and  product development approach, allows faster time to market. In particular, it has enabled the development of more than 50 new products in the roofing business in North America. In all stages of construction or renovation projects, the digital  model,  or  Building  Information  Modeling  (BIM), which offers an integrated vision of the building during all stages of its life cycle through a 'digital twin', modifies the very design of buildings, and allows custom parts to be cut in the factory, with customized deliveries on site. This technological revolution paves the way for an increase in the Group's sales; it maximizes Saint-Gobain's contribution to  the  productivity  of  its  professional  customers,  with savings of up to 30% in terms of installation time, and also offers considerable room for improvement when it comes to minimizing their environmental footprint, with savings of up to 20% of waste produced during the installation phase,  moving  towards  zero  waste.  Also  during  the construction phases, the deployment of sensors enables real-time monitoring  of  atmospheric  conditions  and improves  site  productivity,  giving  the  customer  the competitive advantage of reducing rework by up to 90%. Deployed  in  Canada,  this  technology  has  enabled  the Group to achieve a penetration rate of over 80% in the provinces  of  British  Columbia  and  Quebec.  It  is  an outstanding  example  of  know-how,  which  strengthens Saint-Gobain's reputation as a solution provider.",

        "page_content": "## Innovation in digital services 3.3.2.4\n\nIn addition to its existing offers, Saint-Gobain is innovating by  offering  new  digital  services  designed  to  take  into account the entire experience of its professional customers.  The  roll-out  of  true  digital  solutions  in countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway and Sweden enables craftsmen to be supported from  their  training  needs  (through  the  \"G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Artisans\" platform), to purchases of products (through the Toca  Obra  platform)  to  new  business  (through  the \"La/uni00A0Maison Saint-Gobain\" platform), assistance in making estimates  and  costing  construction  sites  (through  the Solu+ glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> platform), or, downstream,  the  generation  of estimates and invoices (through the Tolteck solution). This comprehensive  support,  taking  into  account  all  the expectations of its professional customers, allows them to improve  productivity,  by  saving  time  and  improving efficiency. For the Group, this is the basis of increased loyalty on the part of its customers, as well as progress such as gains of more than 15/uni00A0percentage points in the net promoter score, in the case of users of the Solu+ platform.\n\n## Industry/uni00A04.0 3.3.2.5\n\nSaint-Gobain  is  investing  in  industry  4.0  as  part  of  its operational  excellence  goals  to  maintain  its  industrial facilities at the cutting edge  of  the  sector. The organization of factories is being transformed by digital technology. Machines are connected in real time and data analysis allows for better control of production processes, more rapid resolution of any technical issues and, more generally,  an  increase  in  operational  efficiency.  Digital technology  also  helps customize deliverables  further along the value chain and opens up further opportunities for co-development.\n\nThis fourth industrial revolution is also based on advanced automation and robotization of industrial tasks . Within the Group, more than 4,000 robots and automatic trolleys enable  repetitive  tasks  to  be  carried  out  in  complete safety.  Operators  are  connected  (there  are  22,000  of them  on  275  Saint-Gobain  sites)  and  are  assisted  by augmented  reality,  which  is  particularly  effective  for maintenance or repairs.\n\nWith production units where software and machine-tools interact directly with each other, a number of applications have  been  made  possible , such as the real-time monitoring  of  production,  automated  alert  systems, predictive maintenance and the optimization of product quality  by  reducing  both  costs  and  the  quantity  of resources  and  energy  employed.  As  an  example,  the Construction Industry Business Unit uses software based on artificial intelligence to optimize the operation of its fiberglass furnaces.\n\nThe deployment of integrated industrial systems including data analysis , once tested, can be extended to other sites. In the Sekurit plant in Shanghai, an algorithm manages  the  glass  forming  process  for  vehicle  side windows, analyzing millions of pieces of data collected on the production line: an application of the machine learning piloted in 2018 and rolled out to other Sekurit sites in 2020 and  2021.  Generally  speaking,  Saint-Gobain  rolls  out  its\n\ntechnology  step  by  step,  firm  in  the  belief  that  initial, low-cost advances can quickly lead to progress. Today, accessible  and  efficient  solutions  are  used  by  7,000 operators  in  100  Saint-Gobain  plants  worldwide.  For example, an application has been developed to monitor performance  in  real  time  by  anticipating  deviations. Initially launched at the Eggborough factory in the United Kingdom, this application has been rolled out to 25 flat glass factories throughout the world.\n\nReducing the cost of data storage and the price of sensors has contributed to the introduction of tools to assess and monitor production in real time , such as edge computing solutions,  based  on  a  nano-computer  equipped  with open-source artificial intelligence software for key equipment. This approach, launched for example in the abrasives manufacturing plants in India, constitutes a first step  towards  the  development  of  multi-factory  global artificial intelligence solutions, thanks to data storage and enrichment.  In  total,  more  than  60%  of  Saint-Gobain's main industrial sites are already connected to the Group's digital manufacturing hub, thus creating a digital production ecosystem.\n\nIn 2020, Saint-Gobain began to extend to numerous plants around the world its Data and Analytics Academy (DnA) program, which is designed to help factories develop a data-driven  culture .  In  addition  to  data  specialists  and 'translators' (experts who serve as a link between data analysis  and  operations),  the  DnA  program  aims  to develop and implement training to create an initial base of skills among Group employees through a practice-based approach.  It  is  not  a  question  of  transforming  all employees into data specialists but rather demystifying the subject and enabling them to understand how to use it in  order  to  carry  out  predictive  maintenance,  improve flows,  save  energy  and  increase  plant  productivity  and flexibility; by providing them with training and coaching, the aim is to enable them to gain autonomy and achieve their local objectives.\n\nThe  DnA  program  was  developed  with  the  active participation of numerous  industrial  managers,  data specialists, WCM program managers and IT departments. Tested  in  2019  in  three  European  countries  (Poland, France and Spain), it is now being rolled out widely. The program has been adapted to the healthcare context, and in particular adapted for distance learning via collaborative tools.\n\nAdvanced  data  analysis,  at  the  heart  of  Saint-Gobain's 'Industry/uni00A04.0' program,  enables  the  optimization  of industrial processes at the gypsum block production site in Staviany (Czech Republic). Based on the deployment of more than 100 sensors, this approach makes it possible to correlate process parameters with data concerning energy quality and consumption, opening the way to a reduction in  gas  consumption  of  6%  and  a  reduction  in  energy consumption of 20%. In Brazil, the implementation of data analysis in the Group's industrial supply chain through the creation of a 'transportation control tower', the real-time modification of logistics planning, and predictive analytics resulted in an 11% cost reduction and a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions.\n\n2",

It  draws  on  a  double  pledge:  minimizing  the  Group's footprint as regards with women,  men  and  the environment, and maximizing its positive contribution as regards with climate, social and societal challenges. It is thus  in  sync  with  demands  that  are  now  paramount throughout  the  Saint-Gobain  ecosystem;  it  is  estimated that more than 80% of investors already have a structured approach in terms of environmental, social and governance issues, or are in the process of developing one (1) . The Group maintains the highest Corporate Social Responsibility  standards , emphasizing  its  culture  and values,  so  that  it  can  constantly  set  an  example  for compliance, respect for the environment and the health and  safety  of  everyone.  Saint-Gobain  is  constantly strengthening its requirements in the areas of diversity and inclusion, supporting the training of its staff, with the aim of creating the conditions for their involvement in all aspects  of  the  Company's  life.  The  Group  sees  this integration of Corporate Social Responsibility as being the heart  of  its  strategy  and  a  continuous  improvement process:\n\n- 2003:  Saint-Gobain  signs  the  United  Nations  Global /uni25A0 Compact  and  adopts  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action (see chapter/uni00A01, section 2.2.2);\n- 2009: formalization of the compliance program; /uni25A0\n- 2015:  setting  of  ambitious  environmental  targets  for /uni25A0 2025 (reduction of CO2 emissions by 20%, reduction of water discharges by 80%, reduction of non-recovered waste  by  50%  compared  to  2010  at  equal  levels  of production);\n- 2020: development  of  the  roadmap  to  carbon /uni25A0 neutrality by 2050 and formalization of new environmental objectives for 2030.\n\nThe Group sees this commitment as a real differentiating factor  compared  to  its  competitors . Saint-Gobain  has long since built its credibility in the fight against climate change, through the impact of its solutions on reducing GHG emissions in the construction and mobility sectors and  through  its  action  to  reduce  emissions  from  its industrial processes, a twofold action that is a source of long-term growth for the Group. In addition, the Group sees the various dimensions of its social responsibility as a source of attractiveness for talent recruited and support for the Saint-Gobain brand.\n\n## Integrating CSR at the heart 3.4.2 of the model\n\nSaint-Gobain,  in  line  with  the  concept  of  integrated thinking,  aims  firstly to  integrate  ESG  criteria  into  the Group's  management  methods .  CSR  Committees  have been  created  within  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the Executive Committee of Saint-Gobain.\n\nIt then orchestrates, at the global level, the acceleration of the implementation of the CSR roadmaps adopted by the entities at the local level . To this end, no less than 22,000/uni00A0employees are part of more than 40 internal CSR communities; an internal CO2 price was established in 2016 and revised upwards in October/uni00A02021, to \u20ac75 per ton for capital expenditure, and \u20ac150 per ton for research and development decisions; lastly, a capital investment budget of \u20ac100/uni00A0million per year has been allocated to initiatives (including  research  and  development)  to  reduce  the Group's carbon footprint.\n\nFinally, it contributes to shaping the CSR outlook for all business  sectors  in  which  Saint-Gobain  operates .  The Group  collaborates  with  NGOs  and  semi-public  bodies such as EFRAG; the Group is also developing partnerships with other members of its ecosystem, such as the WBCSD; it increasingly nurtures close relationships with start-ups to leverage  open  innovation  (see,  in  this  chapter, section glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> 3.3.1.4).",

        "page_content": "## Building a culture of trust, responsibility and/uni00A0collaboration 3.5\n\nSaint-Gobain's new organization, aiming to empower at the local level, entails building trust , as a condition for effective  delegation  of  authority;  but  also fostering cross-functional collaboration at global level. The impact that the sanitary crisis has had on the ways of working has demonstrated the relevance of this new organization and of  new management methods. Saint-Gobain's positioning as a solution provider , capable of assembling products, systems and services, makes this increased collaboration essential  for  the  implementation  of  the  new  'Grow  & Impact' strategic plan.\n\nThe TEC approach, which concerns all Group employees , applies to behavioral , organizational and cultural aspects of life at Saint-Gobain. Trust, empowerment,  and collaboration lie at the heart of the Group's transformation and growth model. This implies promoting reciprocity and virtuous collaborative behavior, which contribute to the development of collective intelligence.\n\nTEC represents a significant change in corporate culture within the Group, which primarily concerns managerial culture : the aim is to establish, by default, the principle of trust and thus move from a vertical, traditional structure, to  an open,  learning  organization,  leaving  freedom  of action at local management level in the various countries where  Saint-Gobain  operates.  It  also  responds  to  the underlying trends affecting the world in which the Group operates,  and  in  particular  to  the  disintermediation brought  about  by  new  technologies,  which  makes managerial  methods  obsolete  and  promotes  profound changes in the relationship between individuals and work. In  this  sense,  the  TEC  approach  represents  a  way  of aligning  Saint-Gobain's  strategy  with  changes  in  the\n\nlifestyles and expectations of its various stakeholders (see in this chapter, section 1.1.5), and also a way of enhancing its brand as an employer.\n\nTthe TEC culture also helps make the innovation process more efficient , and also helps to align it with customer needs by removing barriers between countries, business lines (solutions for construction and solutions for industry) and functions (for exmaple researchers, marketing specialists, technicians).\n\nTo implement  this  approach  in  practice ,  the  Group  is increasingly relying on its training program (see chapter/uni00A03, section 4.3.5), and also on approaches such as collective and  individual  coaching,  made  accessible  to  a  wider audience,  or  the  generalization  of  360\u00b0  assessments. Giving and receiving feedback is also encouraged, so as to strengthen  collaboration  and  trust,  across  the  whole Group  (for  example  via  the  annual  Me@Saint-Gobain survey), at individual level (by developing the capacity to ask for feedback and to provide it) as well as regards with project management  (for  example  via  the  Evolve collaborative platform).\n\nAmong the initiatives put in place to promote the spread of the TEC  culture throughout Saint-Gobain, two programs  are  deployed  via  the  Unicampus  program, combining courses and collaborative activities. The first is the virtual training session entitled 'Become a Saint-Gobain culture champion to serve strategy'; accessible to all Group employees, and highly recommended  for  new  hires.  The  second,  called  'Grow your Impact as a TEC leader', is a workshop specifically dedicated to managers in charge of teams.\n\n## Focusing on talent, diversity and inclusion 3.6\n\nThe  development  of  Saint-Gobain  depends  first  and foremost on the quality and expertise of the men and women who make up the Group . This is reflected first and foremost in the attention paid to recruitment , in a context of tension across all functions and business lines offered by Saint-Gobain, in production, distribution and support functions. The Group is therefore fully committed to the race to recruit the best talents in all specialties, among which  engineers,  digital  &  data  scientists,  sales  and marketing  staff,  product  managers,  supply  chain  and sustainability specialists. Beyond the recruitment process and the attention paid to its brand as an employer, it is Saint-Gobain's  collective  ability  to  train,  nurture  and constantly  develop  these  talents that  will  enable  it  to stand out. With digital and refined data processing, career paths  can  be  more  easily  individualized  and  the  HR support policy customized (see chapter/uni00A03, section 4.3.7). As  to  managers,  the  \"SG  Talents\"  program  aims  at identifying those who have significant evolution potential or key skills. Generally speaking, employee development , which implies taking into account individual aspirations as well as the organization's needs, entails listening to each employee,  providing  internal  (geographic  or  functional) mobility options, and measuring satisfaction and engagement on a comprehensive and regular basis. In the end,  all  of  the  Group's  actions  resulted  in  a  record employee engagement index of 83% in 2021 (1) , with than 85% of them considering that their working conditions are good.\n\nThis ambition is put into practice by using a whole series of  mechanisms:  from  the  quality  of  social  dialogue  to training programs, compensation policy and well-being in general.  It  is  also  about promoting  diversity  in  all  its forms : the variety of points of view, experiences, cultures and backgrounds has a positive impact on the working conditions and creativity of the teams, on the potential for innovation,  and  on  results. Saint-Gobain  is  making progress on these different fronts , for example with the deployment of tools such as women's networks (WIN by Saint-Gobain),  and  26.3%  of  managers  at  Group  level being women.  This approach is embodied  in all Saint-Gobain entities. For example, the Mobility Business Unit has just launched the 'Women Group' project, which aims  to  promote  diversity  internally,  to  give  women visibility, and to help them develop and find their place in the company. It is based on training (in particular on the dismantling of biases and interpersonal relationships), on the  establishment  of  pairs  for  coaching,  and  on  the structuring of a community. In Brazil, the gender diversity dynamic, which began in 2012, continues to grow, through initiatives  such  as  a  diversity  survey,  an  update  of  the recruitment  policy,  the  deployment  of  training  modules and the implementation of specific assessment tools. In India, on-the-job training and skills development programs have helped to improve the gender ratio at the Group's industrial  production  sites.  In  North  America,  programs dedicated  to  the  integration  and  visibility  of  black  and LGBTQ  communities  have  made  it  possible  to  roll  out actions  over  several  months.  In  Spain,  Portugal  and Morocco,  speaking  is  at  the  heart  of  the  approach.",

Saint-Gobain  also  launched  the  construction  of  a  new plant in China in Jiangsu  province,  and  also  the commissioning of a third production line in Brazil , and an investment of more than $400/uni00A0million over the next four years to increase roofing, insulation and plaster production capacities  at  four  key  production  sites  in  the United States .\n\nIn Europe , the  Group  invests  for  its  development:  in Poland , in Gorlice, the Construction Industry Business Unit has initiated new industrial production of silica glass . This new  production  for  the  Adfors  brand  will  be  used  for various applications such as high-temperature insulation or batteries for electric vehicles . In France, the second stage of the program to expand the Life Sciences plant in Charny  (Yonne)  involved  doubling  its  capacity  for  the production  of  silicone  tubes,  and  it  now  manufactures braided tubes to meet  the  demand  of  European customers. Another plant, located in Aniche, has commissioned  a  new  laminated  glass  for  buildings  line, allowing  both  a  50%  increase  in  production  and  a significant reduction in production defects, while reducing energy  consumption.  in Germany , Saint-Gobain  Weber expanded  its  Weilerswist  plant  (near  Cologne)  by mid-year, doubling the site's surface area and increasing both its production and storage capacities.\n\nIn Mexico, the Group opened in 2021 a new line in Saltillo (Coahuila  state)  that  will  produce flat  glass  for  the construction and automotive markets . The plant will be equipped with the latest cutting-edge technologies, both in terms of energy efficiency and Industry/uni00A04.0. The glass manufactured  at  this  new  site  will  serve  the  domestic\n\nconstruction and automotive markets, and also the United States and Central American countries.\n\nIn Asia , the Bioprocess Solutions Business Unit made two investments  to  manufacture  single-use  systems,  one  in South Korea , the other in China . With these new locations, Saint-Gobain will be able to ensure faster delivery times and a more independent supply from other regions, and therefore  better  continuity  of  service  to  its  Asian customers in the event of supply tensions, thus limiting the risk of disruption. In Vietnam , a new plant producing fiber cement solutions , opened in September/uni00A02021, will enable Saint-Gobain  to  maintain  its  leading  position  in  this growing market by being closer to its customers and thus reducing supply chain costs. The opening of this plant in the center of the country thus strengthens the Group in its position as market leader in fibrocement in Vietnam. As the first Saint-Gobain plant is located in the south of the country, this new site will be able to respond more quickly to the demands of customers in the north and center, thereby reducing supply and logistics costs. In China , the investment  made  at  the  Saint-Gobain  Sekurit  site  in Shanghai  will  make  it  possible  to  produce  laminated windshields  for  electric  vehicles  and  reach  an  annual capacity of 900,000 pieces. In India , in Bangalore, the 'Surface  Solutions'  Business  Unit  is  investing  in  a  new coated abrasives production line. In order to accelerate its development  in  South-East  Asia , the  Group  has  just inaugurated  a  new  Weber  site  in  Malaysia,  which  will produce coatings  for  interior  and  exterior  fa\u00e7ades , waterproofing and solutions for building chemicals , and also 3D printing solutions . These products will be mainly intended for markets in Malaysia and Singapore .\n\n## Supporting the Group's 4.1.3 commitments and its transformation\n\nTo  achieve  its  objectives  in  terms  of  minimizing  its footprint, and in particular to respect its commitment to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050, Saint-Gobain set up a capital investment budget of \u20ac100/uni00A0million per year for all initiatives (including research and development) aiming at reducing the Group's carbon footprint .",

These acquisitions are perfectly aligned with the Group's strategy formulated in the Grow & Impact plan.\n\nSaint-Gobain's vision, to be the worldwide leader in light and sustainable construction , naturally leads to external growth that favors sectors such as construction chemicals, prefabrication  and  light  construction  methods.  Such  a strategy  enables  the  Group  to  consolidate  its  leading position, particularly in North America and Asia, and to expand its offering.\n\nThe acquisition of Chryso , a specialist in admixtures for concrete and additives, offering differentiated and innovative solutions and employing approximately 1,300 people,  significantly  strengthens  Saint-Gobain's  offering for sustainable construction. This acquisition was supplemented by the announcement, in December 2021, of the signature of an agreement for the purchase of GCP Applied Technologies (the finalization of the transaction is expected to take place by the end of 2022). In the same vein, the Group made significant acquisitions in Mexico in 2021, namely Impac, a leading player in Latin America, with a plant in Monterrey (Nuevo Leon); in Romania: Duraziv , a company  specializing  in production  of  adhesives  and other value-added solutions in construction chemicals ; in Peru: Z/uni00A0Aditivos has extensive experience in cement and asphalt  additives;  and  in  Russia: Adheziv , a  company specializing in polyurethanes and epoxy products. With these acquisitions, the Group's activities in mortars and construction chemicals represented more than \u20ac4 billion in sales in 2021.\n\nIn  Germany,  in  2021  the  Group  announced  that  it  had acquired  a  majority  stake  in Br\u00fcggemann ,  one  of  the country's  leading  companies  in  the  manufacture  and installation of turnkey modular  timber  construction solutions for new construction and renovation. In France, Saint-Gobain completed the acquisition of Panofrance , a specialist distributor of timber and panels for construction and furnishing industries, enabling the Group to strengthen its presence in the fast-growing market for timber-based building systems , providing light solutions and and rapid implementation.\n\nIn Mauritius ,  Saint-Gobain  acquired  a  majority  stake  in ABE,  a  major  player  in  waterproofing,  additives  and mortars  in  the  Indian  Ocean.  In  addition,  to  meet  the growing market demand in Sub-Saharan Africa , the Group acquired Kens Metal, enabling it to establish an industrial presence in Kenya with a gypsum production line.\n\nIn India ,  Saint-Gobain  entered  into  an  agreement  with Alghanim Group for the acquisition of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rockwool India Pvt Ltd., a major/uni00A0manufacturer of  stone  wool  in  the  country,  which  uses  Saint-Gobain technology under license for this manufacture. Rockwool India has two manufacturing/uni00A0facilities in India, in Hyderabad and Silvassa, with a total production capacity of  50,000  tons,  and  benefits  from  a  strong  marketing network across the/uni00A0country.\n\n## Continuing a regular portfolio 4.2.2 review to focus the Group's strengths\n\nSaint-Gobain continued its portfolio optimization strategy, aimed at enhancing the Group's growth and profitability profile in line with the objectives of the Grow & Impact plan in the light of three decisive criteria: the strategic suitability  of  the  activity  in  relation  to  the  rest  of  the Group; its performance against Saint-Gobain's own value creation  criteria;  and  its  prospects  within  the  Group's global organization.\n\nIn 2021, Saint-Gobain completed or signed 20 disposals for \u20ac2.0 billion in sales.\n\nIn the glass sector, the group announced that it had sold Saint-Gobain Glassolutions Objekt-Center, which specializes in glass processing operations as part of the Glassolutions network  in  Germany,  to  the  German privately-owned  Aequita  group  based  in  Munich.  This disposal  concerns  the  two  sites  of  D\u00f6ring  Berlin  and Radeburg, which generated \u20ac20 million in sales in 2020. Aequita had already purchased the activities of Glassolutions  in  the  Netherlands  in  2019.  In  September 2021,  Saint-Gobain  also  sold  Glassolutions  Belgium  and Deggendorf, and announced at the end of 2021 that it had sold Glassolutions Denmark.\n\nIn distribution , Saint-Gobain signed agreements for the sale  of  Graham,  its  distribution  activity  specializing  in plumbing, sanitary and heating in the United Kingdom; and also for the sale to Wolseley UK of three of its remaining four  UK  distribution  brands  specialized  in  plumbing, heating and sanitaryware in the United Kingdom: Neville Lumb, DHS and Bassets. The Group has also entered into exclusive negotiations with Wolseley UK for the sale of Ideal Bathrooms, the remaining distribution brand specialized in plumbing, heating and sanitaryware products  in  the  United  Kingdom.  Saint-Gobain  also finalized the sale of three retailers in Spain, La Plataforma de  la  Construccion  to  the  BigMat  group,  as  well  as Discesur to Group Jorge Fernandez in association with Group  Terrapilar,  and  lastly  the  Sanigrif  and  Saniplast brands. In the Netherlands, the Group completed the sale announced  in  early  January  2021  to  BME  (Building Materials Europe) of Saint-Gobain Building Distribution the Netherlands  (SGBD  NL),  an  entity  operating  under  the Raab  Karcher,  Tegelgroep  Nederland,  Galvano  and  Van Keulen  brands,  which  has  38  sales  outlets  in  seven countries. In France, announced at the end of 2020, the sale by Saint-Gobain of Lapeyre to Mutares, a company listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, was completed. This transaction  aims  to  concentrate  Saint-Gobain's resources on its strategic activities.\n\nIn pipe business, Saint-Gobain announced the signing of an  agreement  under  the  terms  of  which  the  Group  is disposing  of  67%  of  its  pipes  business  in  China  to  a consortium  led  by  local  management.  The  transaction values the company  at  around  \u20ac100  million.  This transaction resulted in the sale by Saint-Gobain of control of PAM China, while maintaining its link with the pipes business  in  Europe,  as  part  of  a  long-term  industrial partnership.  It  is  part  of  the  strategy  of  continuing  to optimize  the  Group's  portfolio,  aimed  at  enhancing  its growth and profitability profile.\n\n2",

They define the values and rules applicable to all Group entities and employees, across all employment contract types  (open-ended  contracts,  fixed-term  contracts  and temporary  staff),  and  also  to  their  subcontractors  and suppliers. This applies in particular to compliance policies, the human rights policy, the Environmental, Health and Safety  (EHS)  charter,  the  purchasing  and  suppliers charters of the responsible purchasing program, and the diversity policy.\n\nThe  code  of  ethics  also  sets  out  the  procedures  for working  with  stakeholders,  with  a  particular  focus  on permanent  on-site  subcontractors,  other  subcontractors and  suppliers.  For  this  reason,  it  is  translated  into  31 languages and is available on the Group's website for wide distribution  to  stakeholders.  Each  employee,  including those  on  fixed-term  contracts  and  temporary  staff, receives information during their induction about the code of  ethics  in  the  local  language.  This  may  take  various forms, depending on the country:\n\n- a welcome brochure with comments from the Human /uni25A0 Resources representative;\n- the code of ethics may be appended to the contract of /uni25A0 employment.\n\nIn-person  trainings  are  provided  in  all  countries  where Saint-Gobain operates. It is provided either by an Ethics and  Compliance  Manager  or  by  a  local  correspondent trained for this purpose. Modules are regularly included in management school sessions. These sessions are adapted to the seniority of the managers; they aim to discuss their daily  practices,  the  difficulties  encountered  in  different cultures, and the way in which values guide decisions. In order to ensure wide deployment in countries, managers, usually from HR or Compliance networks, are trained to provide training on the code of ethics. They can therefore organize  sessions  for  all  the  employees  or  for  external stakeholders such as suppliers.\n\nAn e-learning course called 'Adhere' is available for all employees and is compulsory for all managers. Throughout  the  Saint-Gobain  University  Management School training course, a module dedicated to the code of ethics allows managers to discuss the issues and share their operational experiences. Because of the health crisis, training formats had to be adapted to digital media, with the  ambition  of  maintaining  the  interactivity  that  is essential for preserving time to exchange experiences and difficulties encountered.\n\nThe Group has set itself the goal of training each new manager, from the first year of integration, to the code of ethics, the fight against corruption and compliance with competition  law.  This  objective  is  included  in  the  CSR dashboard  monitored  by  the  Board  of  Directors  (see chapter/uni00A04, section/uni00A02.1).\n\nOn  June/uni00A017,  2021,  an  event  was  organized  in  all  the countries where Saint-Gobain operates to promote and discuss its values, the Principles of Conduct and Action. Transparency and trust between colleagues, the defense of  human  rights,  fairness  in  business  practices,  the protection of personal data, the integrity of the Group's supply chain and the fight against corruption were the themes discussed on over 2,300/uni00A0sites, during workshops, conferences, debates and presentations.\n\nThis  event  generated  a  strong  mobilization  of  all  the Group's employees. They expressed the importance of the code of ethics in nurturing trust and enabling success as part of the purpose: 'Making the World a Better Home'. The event was sponsored by Saint-Gobain's management. A video of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy CEO and the General Secretary speaking about their  experience  of  ethics  was  shared  with  more  than 120,000/uni00A0employees, and the General Secretary's statement posted on the Group's internal social network was viewed more than 45,000/uni00A0times.\n\n## Deploying business ethics and 1.1.2 compliance programs\n\nAt Saint-Gobain, business ethics programs aim to pursue both an ethical and a compliance objective in the conduct of the Group's business. The Group's ethics and compliance program is thus designed and implemented as a natural extension of the Group's values and commitments.\n\nWhile ethics aims to ensure that everyone complies at all times  with  the  values  at  the  heart  of  the  Principles  of Conduct  and  Action,  compliance  aims  to  ensure  that everyone  always  complies  with  laws,  regulations  and international  conventions  applicable  to  the  Group,  the violation  of  which  is  likely  to  result  in  penalties  (civil, administrative or criminal) for the company, its managers and employees and/or commercial, financial and reputational damage.\n\nThe ethics and compliance program has been based, since 2009, on the adoption and deployment of appropriate and effective tools (internal policies and procedures, training, whistle-blowing system, reporting, audit) and the promotion of appropriate behaviors.",

The  active  fight  against  this scourge is of concern to everyone.\n\nSince 2003, Saint-Gobain has expressed its commitment to  the  fight  against  corruption  by  signing  the  Global Compact  of  the  United  Nations,  the  tenth  principle  of which  calls on companies  to  take  action  against corruption.\n\nIn addition, the Group has since then set up a program to prevent  the  risks  of  corruption  and  influence  peddling, including a commitment  from  directors  and  strict compliance with the principle of 'zero tolerance'.\n\nThis program is based on:\n\n- a  mapping  of  the  risks  of  corruption  and  influence /uni25A0 peddling;\n- policies and procedures; /uni25A0\n- training, in particular the digital training called 'ACT', /uni25A0 which  is  followed  by  all  managers  when  they  are onboarded as well as every two years;\n- communication actions; /uni25A0\n- audits  conducted  internally  or  by  external  service /uni25A0 providers.\n\nIn 2020, the Group publicly released the new version of its anti-corruption policy on the fight against corruption and influence peddling.\n\nThe purpose of this manual is to define and illustrate the various  types  of  behavior  to  be  prohibited,  review  the Group's  rules  and  the  best  practices  to  adopt, i.e .,  the procedures relating to all areas in which corruption and influence peddling risks are likely to materialize, such as gifts  and  invitations,  conflicts  of  interest,  recruitment, mergers and acquisitions, or the management  of intermediaries.\n\nAll Saint-Gobain employees must feel responsible for the fight against corruption. Therefore, the policy is based on concrete and educational examples of what is and is not allowed in the practice of the professional. It recalls the following fundamental principle: the fight against corruption and influence peddling presupposes a principle of 'zero tolerance'.\n\nThe anti-corruption policy is fully committed to by both the  Group's  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group's Executive  Committee,  and  was  signed  by  nearly  3,000 senior employees when it was launched.\n\nThe  management  of  the  anti-corruption  policy  is  the responsibility of the Group's Senior Management, which delegates  design,  deployment  of  programs  and  the monitoring  of  its effectiveness to the Ethics and Compliance Department.\n\n## Compliance with competition law 1.2.2\n\nSaint-Gobain has put in place a competition law compliance program based on:\n\n- policies and procedures, notably regarding membership /uni25A0 of professional associations;\n- training  and  communication  actions:  practical  guides /uni25A0 are made available, in particular 'The ins and outs of competition law' available on the Group's website; an e-learning training course called 'Comply' is followed for  the  first  time  by  all  managers  when  they  are onboarding,  and  then  repeated  every  two  years; numerous in-person training sessions are provided by the Ethics and Compliance Department and the Ethics and  Compliance  Managers;  lastly,  the  theme  was covered as part of the Principles of Conduct and Action Day;\n- audits conducted by third parties. /uni25A0\n\n## Compliance with economic 1.2.3 sanctions and export control regulations\n\nSaint-Gobain has implemented a program for compliance with economic sanctions and export controls.

The Group's policy on this subject is publicly available on its website. The purpose of this policy is to set out data collection, use, communication and confidentiality conditions.\n\nAs Saint-Gobain's activities are highly decentralized, this governance aims to support the entities by taking into account their needs and the local context in which they operate. Each Group entity established in the European Union  has  appointed  a  Privacy  Correspondent  who manages, with the support of a Privacy Advisor and in close  collaboration  with  the  business  lines  (IT,  digital, marketing,  human  resources,  etc.),  the  compliance  of activities. This network of employees who dedicate part of their  activity  to  maintaining  this  approach  (the  Privacy Network) is led by the central team (the Central Privacy Team). It is composed of 45 Privacy Advisors approximately  (lawyers  or  auditors)  and  about  600 Privacy Correspondents (operational profiles).\n\nOutside the European Union, Legal Departments also take these  issues  into  account.  Indeed,  in  a  process  of continuous  improvement,  Saint-Gobain  encourages  the application of key principles of personal data protection, regardless of the location of the entity. These principles provide protection beyond the local regulations in force in the main countries.\n\nCommunication actions are implemented with the Privacy Network  and  functions  (human  resources,  IT,  etc.). Practical  guides  and  procedures  are  made  available  to them. Training is given, in particular through an e-learning training  called  'Data  Protection  by  Saint-Gobain'  and available in French and English. In addition, the protection\n\nof  personal  data  is  covered  by  the  internal  control framework  for  both  companies  established  in  the European  Union  and  for  those  established  outside  the European Union.\n\nSaint-Gobain is continuing to roll out a data protection management platform in its European entities, and also in other  regions  (for  example  in  Brazil).  This  platform facilitates  the  governance  of  personal  data  protection, notably  by  keeping  records  of  processing  activities, assessing the guarantees presented by service providers in  terms  of  data  protection,  carrying  out  related  Data Protection Impact Analysis (DPIAs), the management of incidents involving personal data, etc. Training in the use of this platform is regularly offered to Privacy Correspondents and to Privacy Advisors.\n\n## Taxation 1.2.5\n\nSaint-Gobain acts in compliance with the tax laws of the countries in which it operates and fulfills its tax reporting and payment obligations in time. The Group has therefore not established structures whose purpose is tax evasion. It applies  tax  laws  and  regulations  with  honesty  and integrity.  Its  intragroup  transactions  comply  with  the so-called 'arm's length' principle.\n\nEven  if  the  new  rules  related  to  the  reform  of  the international tax system initiated by the OECD have not yet all been defined, Saint-Gobain does not anticipate any significant change in its income tax expense since it is correlated  with  its  locations  and  therefore  with  the creation of the value. Since 2019, Saint-Gobain has been taking part in the initiative for a tax partnership for regular, transparent dialogue between the French tax authorities and large proactive companies.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "## Respect for human rights in the Group's activities 1.3\n\n## Commitments 1.3.1\n\nSaint-Gobain's  values,  formalized  by  the  Principles  of Conduct and Action, are an essential vector of mobilization for human rights due to their reference to international conventions, such as the International Charter for Human Rights or the applicable conventions of the International  Labor  Organization  and  in  particular  the conventions  87,  98,  111,  and  135  on  the  freedom  of association and protection of the right to organise, on the right to organise and collective bargaining, on discrimination, and on workers' representatives respectively.\n\nSaint-Gobain has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. The first two principles of the Global Compact invite companies to 'support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights' (principle No./uni00A01) and 'make sure that their own companies are not complicit in human rights abuses' (principle No./uni00A02).\n\nIn  2019,  the  Group  published  its  policy  on  respect  for human rights. The policy has been presented to the Board of  Directors.  It  describes  how  Saint-Gobain  takes  into account human rights impacts and outlines the associated due diligence process. The whole approach is based on the recommendations of the United Nations, particularly the  guiding  principles  on  business  and  human  rights. Accordingly,  Saint-Gobain  is  committed  to  respecting human rights wherever it conducts its activities and in its supply chain.\n\n## Analysis of human rights risks in 1.3.2 the Group's activities\n\nSaint-Gobain's  main  human  rights  issues  are  identified following  the  methodology  proposed  by  the  United Nations in the context of the application of its guiding principles and concern the human rights that are likely to be most seriously affected by the negative impact of the company's activities and its value chain.\n\nThe  method  to  identify  the  risks  of  actual  or  potential negative impacts draws on the United Nations' reference base  and  on  external  sources  recognized  for  their relevance.  These  sources  are  linked  to  international institutions such as the United Nations with the Human Development Index, specialist non-governmental organizations  such  as  the  Transparency  International Corruption Perceptions Index, or foundations such as The Global Slavery Index by the Walk Free Foundation to end forced labor.\n\nThe analysis resulted in a mapping of the risks related to the Group's activities. It includes the risks related to the supply chain and respect for human rights described in the section/uni00A0on responsible  purchasing  (see  this  chapter, section/uni00A01.4).\n\nThe risk mapping covers the nature of the risks linked to activities  and  risks  linked  to  the  countries  in  which Saint-Gobain operates. The main risks identified concern four areas: respect for employee rights, health and safety at work, respect for the environment and anti-corruption.\n\nThe management of occupational health and safety risks is described in this chapter, section/uni00A04.2 and those concerning respect for the environment in this chapter, section/uni00A02.1.3. The management of corruption risks is described in this chapter/uni00A03, section/uni00A01.2.1.\n\nIn November  2021,  the  due  diligence  process  was undertaken to update the Group's assessment of human\n\nrights risks and  impacts  as  well  as  the  measures implemented  to  manage  these  risks,  limit  the  risks  of negative impacts, provide responses to impacted stakeholders  if  necessary,  and  improve  situations  that need to be improved. To this end, a questionnaire was sent to human resources and operational managers in 35 of the most exposed countries, and the responses were analyzed. This analysis allows us to verify that the Group's practices are in line with the human rights policy and the risks identified.\n\n## Measures to control risks 1.3.3 associated with employee rights\n\nRespect for the rights of employees is essential to ensure a fair and  equitable  working  environment,  ensuring personal  and  professional  fulfillment  (see  this  chapter, section/uni00A01.3.3). Thus, 'respect for employees' rights' is one of the nine Principles that constitute Saint-Gobain's code of ethics. In addition, thanks to its human rights policy, Saint-Gobain  clearly  described  its  commitment  to  the following  principles:  the  fight  against  forced  labor,  the fight against child labor, freedom of association and the fight  against  discrimination.  Since  signing  the  United Nations  Global  Compact,  the  Group  has  published  an annual progress statement.\n\nSaint-Gobain's entities ensure that each employee performs their work on the basis of freely agreed terms of employment  according  to  a  shared  and  accepted document  and  receives  the  payment  of  a  fair  wage according to the hours worked. Freedom of association is guaranteed at all industrial sites and sales outlets. The age of the employee is checked by local employees as part of the fight against child labor. An annual analysis of the HR database is performed to verify that employees under the age of 18 are employed under specific contracts related to their education, such as apprenticeship contracts.\n\nFinally, the Group values and seeks diversity among its teams. Mutual respect and a policy of equal treatment in terms of recruitment, access to promotions, professional training and compensation are the main levers for action. Everywhere  it  operates,  Saint-Gobain  undertakes  to promote inclusion and diversity in all its forms: gender, nationalities, training, career paths, generational diversity, disabilities and ethnic and social origins.\n\nThe  system  for  collecting  grievances  reported  by  the network  of  local  HR  has  been  improved  to  encourage employees  to  express  themselves  directly  to  their superiors or the human resources network. Entities declare any incidents of discrimination leading to a complaint or otherwise, in the course of judgment or finally judged and characterized  as  such.  Every  incident  is  examined  and dealt with in the subsidiaries concerned. Group employees also  have  access  to  a  whistle-blowing  system  that guarantees  their  anonymity,  described  in  this  chapter, section/uni00A01.6. Particular attention is paid to risks of harassment.\n\nFollowing the analysis of the questionnaires completed by Saint-Gobain's local teams at the end of 2021 as part of the due diligence process, preventive actions have been launched to further limit the risk of human rights incidents. Good  practices  identified in certain countries and recommendations on topics such as recruitment practices and the adoption of the code of ethics when integrating new employees have been shared within the Group.",

It helps manage and reduce the environmental, social  and  societal  risks  associated  with  Saint-Gobain's supply chains.\n\nThus,  ethical  criteria  respecting  human  rights,  working conditions  and  compliance  with  standards,  health  and safety  and  the  environment  are  integrated  into  the purchasing process. The responsible purchasing program is implemented with high standards in accordance with the  Group's  general  purchasing  principles  to  develop long-term  relationships  with  suppliers,  on  the  basis  of shared improvement plans.\n\nThe program is based on the ISO/uni00A020400/uni00A0standard. In 2021, an audit conducted by an independent third party validated the approach and attested to its maturity.\n\nThe program 'responsible purchasing' includes four major steps set out in Saint-Gobain's vigilance plan:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk management 1.4.1\n\nThe CSR risk mapping of purchases includes risks related to  countries  of  origin  and  risks  related  to  purchasing categories.  Risks  linked  to  human  rights,  particularly forced  labor  and  child  labor,  and  corruption  risks  are reared to the environment of the countries of origin.\n\nRisks linked to purchasing categories include environmental performance, specifically carbon and water footprints  and  health  and  safety.  This  mapping  used recognized  international  sources  to  assess  the  risks\n\nspecific to the countries and activities concerned. While the general principles and sources are identical, the impact of purchases and the risks for the company are weighted according to the nature of the purchase:\n\n- an  upstream  purchase,  managed  by  the  non-trade /uni25A0 purchasing team;\n- a  purchase  related  to  distribution  activity  offerings /uni25A0 managed by the marketing distribution teams and the trade purchasing teams.\n\nDemonstrate ethics and responsibility\n\n3",

        "page_content": "Demonstrate ethics and responsibility\n\nIn accordance with this procedure, purchasing categories or suppliers with specific risks have been identified, such as:\n\n- purchases  of  certain  natural  raw  materials  such  as /uni25A0 wood or sand;\n- certain  types  of  subcontractors  working  directly  on /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain sites;\n- purchases made in countries exposed to risks regarding /uni25A0 human rights in general and child labor, corruption and working conditions in particular.\n\n## Risk management and mitigation 1.4.2 measures\n\nThe process and tools used to manage risks for trade and non-trade  purchases  were  aligned.  However,  the  action plans  put  in  place  are  specific  to  each  of  the  two purchasing teams, to maintain management methods and a  level  of  control  adapted  to  the  risks  and  potential negative impacts of each of the activities.\n\n## For non-trade purchases 1.4.2.1\n\nDepending on the level of risk identified, suppliers answer an evaluation questionnaire based on documentation, that is verified and evaluated by a third party and, depending on the results, an on-site CSR audit takes place. The entire approach  forms  part  of  a  constant  dialogue  with  the supplier and leads to the establishment of action plans and CSR  performance  improvement  plans.  In  2018,  the evaluation questionnaire and its related score scale were reviewed to check that they corresponded to the types and  levels  of  risks  identified  by  the  mapping.  In  2021, following the reassessment of the minimum performance thresholds,  the  suppliers  concerned  were  invited  to undergo a new assessment in order to comply with the Group's reinforced requirements.\n\nThe  Group  set  itself  the  objective,  for  the  2017-2021 period, of assessing the CSR performance of more than 90% of suppliers deemed to pose a risk and which achieve annual revenue of more than \u20ac100,000 with the Group.\n\nAbout CSR audits, the objective is to conduct around 40 to 50 audits a year, mainly in emerging countries. These audits  may  lead  to  de-listings  if  critical  failings  are identified,  or  if  the  necessary  corrective  plans  are  not implemented within the agreed periods. The use of the 'SMETA 4-Pillar' standard for on-site audits is widespread, so that suppliers' auditing efforts can be better shared with all of their customers. Based on the results of the assessments, the relevant buyer implements a corrective action  plan  with  the  supplier,  including  priorities  and deadlines for implementation.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance with these action plans, a supplier  de-listing  policy  is  applicable,  after  which  the supplier will no longer have access to the Group's calls for\n\ntenders and all entities of the latter will withdraw from any ongoing partnerships.\n\nThe Responsible Purchasing policy is being rolled out to non-trade suppliers via a private digital platform developed  by  Saint-Gobain  and  entirely  dedicated  to responsible  purchasing.  Suppliers  have  access  to  it  to acknowledge receipt of the Group Suppliers Charter, to send essential supporting documents electronically (wood certificates, quality certificates, ISO standards), to answer self-assessment questionnaires, to obtain all information on Saint-Gobain's 'responsible purchasing' guidelines and to  access  details  of  their  CSR  evaluations  or,  where appropriate, CSR audits.\n\nThe  responsible purchasing approach  also  includes ongoing training for buyers on the Group code of ethics, with particular emphasis on the fight against corruption, the working conditions of employees of suppliers, forced labor  and  child  labor.  Constant  information  on  the sustainable  development  stakes  is  also  communicated. The Department of Non-Trade Purchasing has issued a 'Best  Practices'  brochure  for  all  purchasers,  to  remind them of the CSR best practices to be built into the whole of the purchasing process.\n\n## For trade purchases 1.4.2.2\n\nThe procedures and tools were aligned with those already in  place  for  non-trade  purchases.  Given  the  different nature  of  purchases,  certain  risk  criteria  and  their weighting  and  performance  monitoring  are  managed separately by the marketing and purchasing teams of the distribution entities. The program is overseen by a team from the Group's responsible purchasing team. Accordingly, synergies and best practices for responsible purchasing are shared between the various buyers, while a measure of performance adapted to operational risks and opportunities is maintained.\n\nThis implementation was accompanied  by  training sessions  for  buyers.  Strategic  suppliers  are  primarily affected by the deployment of the Responsible Purchasing program. This involves the European supplier partners of the distribution entities that make purchases of more than \u20ac3 million and the main suppliers of the brands in each country. These identified suppliers cover more than/uni00A079% of trade purchases (see chapter 9, section 2.1.4.1).\n\nAt the same time, the marketing and purchasing teams of the 'Building Distribution' Business Unit are continuing the qualification and control audits of the factories of their own-brand  suppliers,  especially  in  India  and  China.  The purpose of these audits is to assess their management system,  the  environmental,  social  and  legal  aspects  of production activities, and to ensure the good quality of the products.\n\nFollowing each audit, the supplier receives a report as well as  recommendations  on  compliance  with  an  expected effective date or paths for improvement.",

In 2020, over 90% of these purchases  are  from  open  and  mechanized  quarries. Suppliers undergo evaluations of their environmental and social  practices  as  part  of  the  Responsible  Purchasing policy. Finally, the Group is implementing an action plan to reduce  its  sand  consumption,  by  substituting  it  with recycled  materials  as  part  of  the  circular  economy program  (see  this  chapter,  section/uni00A02.2).  Since  2018,  an indicator to monitor the reduction of withdrawals of virgin raw  materials  has  been  implemented  (see  chapter/uni00A04, section/uni00A02.2).\n\n## Timber purchases\n\nSaint-Gobain's activities have an impact on timber sector either through the supply of packaging (pallets and boxes) or by purchases of timber for construction markets as part of its distribution activities. Environmental and social risks, and  those  related  to  human  rights  adherence  primarily affect  trade  purchasing.  Saint-Gobain  is  committed  to fighting  deforestation  through  a  \"Timber  Purchasing\" policy, by acting ethically and responsibly throughout the Group's  value  chain  to  preserve  forests,  the  local populations living in them and biodiversity. This policy was issued in the early 2000s and updated in 2020.\n\nTo control risks and ensure traceability of purchases, the \"Timber Purchasing\" policy is based on a due diligence method in compliance with requirements of the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR), and the\n\nDemonstrate ethics and responsibility\n\nrecommendations of recognized institutions or specialized non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as the red list of  endangered  species  maintained  by  the  IUCN (International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature)  and reports of NGOs involved in the fight against deforestation. In particular, for species or regions at risk, specific  certifications  are  required,  such  as  the  FSC\u00ae (Forest Stewardship Council) label.\n\nTo  ensure  that  the  risks  related  to  purchases  can  be controlled,  Saint-Gobain  carries  out  an  inventory  of  its timber  products  purchases  and  their  derivatives.  This year,/uni00A093.4% of timber products and their derivatives from trade come from responsibly managed timber. An audit of this inventory by a third party specializing in deforestation issues was carried out at the end of year in 2020 and has confirmed the solidity of the program to secure purchases and compliance with the \"Timber purchasing\" policy.\n\nAs part of a continuous improvement process, the Group maintains a transparent and regular dialog with non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs)  to  promote responsible forest management.\n\nSince several years, Saint-Gobain has not completed the CDP  questionnaire  on  forests  since  2020.  The  Group shares  CDP's  objective  of  combating  deforestation  for responsible  forest  management;  it  wants  a  transparent dialogue  with  the  CDP  so  that  the  specific  nature  of construction timber is better highlighted in the ratings. Up to now, the questionnaire is focused on issues related to the use of palm oil or exotic species which are little or not present  in  the  construction  business.  This  way,  the answers to the questionnaire and the assessment are not very  representative  of  the  conducted  actions  and  their efficiency.\n\n3",

This  participation  takes  place  directly, via professional associations, and via global, regional or local alliances. The Group's advocacy activities aim to constructively  feed  into  discussions  and  bring  together value  chain  players  and  stakeholders.  Inspired  by  its purpose 'Making the World a Better Home', Saint-Gobain regularly works on the priority themes of decarbonizing the economy and circularity in the construction sector. For example, in 2021, the Group organized a series of three events ahead of the COP26 conference in Glasgow, with high-level speakers, on the theme of the transformation of the value chain needed to decarbonize the construction sector (see this chapter, section/uni00A02.1.6.1).\n\nSaint-Gobain  and  most  of  its  subsidiaries  belong  to professional associations representing their industry at the national or supranational level. For example, in France, the Group is involved in professional associations representing companies,  such  as  Afep  and  Medef.  Saint-Gobain's subsidiaries also cooperate with various local associations or organizations involved in regulatory issues, or related to environmental,  social,  societal  or  economic  issues.  The subsidiaries have internal procedures in place to ensure that their participation in associations is recognized and referenced, and that employees who represent them in associations are trained in the rules of antitrust law. The Group ensures proper coordination of the positions taken locally and ensures that these institutional commitments are well known and respected by the countries.\n\nAs a way of ensuring that it is closely involved in the ongoing national and international debate on the environment and sustainable development, and that it can share  its  experience  in  these  areas  as  a  manufacturer, Saint-Gobain has been  a  member  of  the  French association Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE) (businesses  for  the  environment)  association  since  the organization was founded. EpE is a grouping of around 60 major French and international companies representing all sectors  of  the  economy,  who  are  keen  to  address  the environment more effectively in their strategic decisions and in the way they do business.\n\nThe  Group  is  active  in  the  World  Business  Council  for Sustainable  Development  (WBCSD).  This  organization brings together more than 200 companies worldwide that are thinking about and developing solutions for a more sustainable  world.  In  2021,  Saint-Gobain  contributed  to The Business Case for Circular Buildings report.\n\nAdvocacy and partnerships related to climate issues are included  in  the  \"Net  Zero  Carbon\"  roadmap  (see  this chapter, section/uni00A02.1.5).\n\nThe Group refrains from financing any political party.\n\n## Multi-stakeholder partnerships 1.5.2\n\nAs  a  member  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact, Saint-Gobain regularly reports on its progress in the areas covered by the Compact, to which it adheres at the 'GC Advanced' level, i.e ., according to 21/uni00A0criteria. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, Chairman of the Group, is a member of the Board of Directors of Global Compact France. Saint-Gobain also encourages its partners, particularly its\n\nsuppliers, to commit  to  the  Global  Compact's  ten principles.\n\nLikewise, the Group pays particular attention to the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs), so as to make  progress  in  evaluating  the  real  impacts  that companies can have in working towards a fairer, more sustainable  world.  These  goals  also  make  possible  new multi-stakeholder collaborations, in which companies are engaged  locally  and  globally.  This  is  the  case  for  the following objectives especially:\n\n- SDG 8: 'Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable /uni25A0 economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all';\n- SDG 13: 'Take urgent action to combat climate change /uni25A0 and its impacts'.\n- SDG 17 'Partnerships to achieve the goals'. /uni25A0\n\nIn September/uni00A02020, Saint-Gobain  signed  the  United Nations  Global  Compact's  call  for  multilateralism  and renewed global cooperation in line with SDG 16 ('Justice, peace and strong institutions').\n\nFinally, the Group is a member of the forum of committed companies with the organization Transparency International  France.  Thus,  Saint-Gobain  supports  the association's activities and has committed to rejecting and combating  corruption,  in  all  its  forms.  The  Group undertakes to make its best efforts to implement a solid prevention  mechanism,  inspired  by  the  current  best practices of the business world.\n\n## Actions for green 1.5.3 and sustainable growth\n\nSaint-Gobain  supports  the  implementation  of  ambitious political  frameworks  to  remove  technical  and  financial obstacles and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.  The  recovery  plans  initiated  by  governments following  the  Covid-19  crisis  are  an  opportunity  to combine the fight against climate change with economic development actions through such ways as initiatives that promote  building  renovation  and  energy  efficiency. Indeed, decarbonization of buildings is essential to achieve the  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  targets  that governments have set for themselves.\n\nThe Group is also a member of the campaign Renovate Europe, which aims to promote ambitious energy-related building  renovation  policies  at  European  level.  In  2021, Saint-Gobain  supported  the  report  'Renovate2Recover' which analyzes the way in which European recovery plans deal with energy-related renovations in construction, and make recommendations on how to make these policies more effective and sustainable.\n\nEuropean  regulatory  projects  related  to  sustainable finance and in particular taxonomy of sustainable activities are  essential  instruments  for  achieving  the  European Union's climate objectives, provided that they are guided by  scientific  criteria  and  developed  in  a  transparent manner. The Group supports the work of the European Commission  and  the  \"sustainable  finance\"  platform  to ensure that the ambition developed in the taxonomy and the  underlying  criteria  better  reflect  the  potential  and specificities of the business sectors concerned.",

In concrete terms, the objective is to help the Group's customers reduce their carbon emissions through the use of its solutions, and to\n\nreduce the carbon impact of its operations across the entire value chain. In September/uni00A02019, Saint-Gobain responded to a call for action issued by a broad coalition of business leaders, civil society representatives and United Nations leaders to help limit the rise in global temperature to a maximum of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n## Governance 2.1.1\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe role of the Board of Directors is to determine Saint-Gobain's strategy and to follow up on its implementation, as well as to monitor its proper management.\n\nAll Directors were trained in climate risks by experts (see chapter 5, section 1.2.4).

Climate-related issues were discussed in four sessions in 2021.\n\n## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe CSR Committee ensures that corporate social responsibility issues are taken into account in the definition of Saint-Gobain's strategy and its implementation (see chapter 5, section 1.1.1 for a description of the responsibilities and activities of the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee in 2021).\n\nFinally, as the Group considers climate change to be a strategic issue, the reduction of CO 2 emissions is a performance criterion included in long-term compensation plans (see chapter 5, section 2.4.2).\n\n## \"CARBON 2030\" ROADMAP\n\nThe \"Carbon Roadmap 2030\" working group is a response to Saint-Gobain's commitment to achieve carbon neutrality, or \"zero net emissions\", by 2050. As a result, Saint-Gobain will reduce its CO 2 emissions as much as possible by 2050 and implement measures to absorb any residual emissions.\n\nThe success of the \"zero net emissions\" ambition is based on the 2030 targets validated by the Science Based Target initiative and on several action levers. This working group is led by the Sustainable Development Department.\n\n## At Group level:\n\n- Qglyph<c=3,font=/ABJDOA+ZapfDingbatsITC> the Strategy Department supports Saint-Gobain's ambition to be a leader in sustainability by integrating sustainable development as a key focus of the Group's growth and di/fferentiation strategy. It monitors and implements the internal carbon price, including the updating of its level;\n- Qglyph<c=3,font=/ABJDOA+ZapfDingbatsITC> the Innovation Department coordinates the innovation e/fforts in processes, both industrial and product design-related;\n- Qglyph<c=3,font=/ABJDOA+ZapfDingbatsITC> the Industrial Technology and Performance Department oversees the coordination of industrial excellence programs, including the \"World Class Manufacturing (WCM) and CapEx commitments;\n- Qglyph<c=3,font=/ABJDOA+ZapfDingbatsITC> the Purchasing Department ensures the mobilization of suppliers by integrating their performance in terms of sustainable development and the signature of the Saint-Gobain \"Responsible Purchasing\" charter as selection criteria.\n\n## Business Units and countries contribute to the carbon neutrality objective:\n\n- Qglyph<c=3,font=/ABJDOA+ZapfDingbatsITC> roadmaps are developed by the countries or Business Units to define their short- and medium-term priorities and objectives in line with Saint-Gobain's objectives, and to draw up their own action plans;\n- Q detailed roadmaps are developed for each industrial process and supplemented by action plans designed and deployed by each country based on knowledge of local markets and regulatory contexts;\n- Q each site defines its own roadmap for the WCM program, in line with international reference frameworks, standards specific to its business required by customers and the improvement objectives that have been set. Each industrial department and each business unit is responsible for defining, leading and monitoring the results of the sites within its scope.",

The implementation and results of this strategy are integrated into scenarios that limit global warming to below a 1.5\u00b0 C rise, so that they are aligned with the Paris Agreement. This requires both risk management and the development of  the  Group's  markets,  including  by  identifying  new opportunities.\n\nTherefore, Saint-Gobain is focusing its action plans around the following areas:\n\n- minimizing its carbon footprint by reducing emissions /uni25A0 in its operations (scopes 1 and 2) and emissions linked to its value  chain  (scope/uni00A03): the  \"carbon  2030\" roadmap represents the Group's action plan to achieve the  CO2  emission  reduction  targets  validated  by  the SBTi on the road to carbon neutrality. In addition to the Group's  roadmap,  the  countries  and  Business  Units have developed local roadmaps. With regard to other environmental  issues  such  as  biodiversity  and  water, Saint-Gobain has set itself targets and has tools to limit the  pressure  it  exerts  on  the  environment  (see  this chapter, section 3.3.2);\n- maximizing  the  impact  of  its  solutions,  through  the /uni25A0 implementation of the Sustainable Solutions for Growth program (see this chapter, section 3.4.4): the design, production and distribution of high-performance\n\nsolutions that contribute positively to the environment, i.e . solutions that promote energy efficiency and the reduction of CO2 emissions. It is thanks to innovation and the evaluation of the performance of solutions (see this chapter, section/uni00A02.1.4.1) that the Group is able to increase its carbon profits and adapt its offering to new opportunities, linked to a just, sustainable and low-carbon transition;\n\n- identification and creation of opportunities, in /uni25A0 collaboration with global and local players;\n- identification, assessment and management of risks: in /uni25A0 response to climate risks, acting as close as possible to the territories (countries, regions, etc.) allows the Group to  rely  on  resilient  local  ecosystems  that  are  more favorable to the development  of  a  low-carbon economy. The ability to forge local partnerships is an asset in risk management.\n\nThe  fight  against  climate  change  requires  cooperation among all stakeholders, particularly governments, companies and civil society around a stringent international framework. In addition, Saint-Gobain's organizational structure is based on a unique combination of local and global, which makes it possible to benefit from new opportunities that meet local needs while being part of global dynamics, especially in terms of energy-efficient building renovation and the development of lightweight construction (see chapter 2, section 3.1).",

As  such,  the  Group  has  identified  ten  risks  and  five  strategic opportunities related to climate change. Each risk and opportunity affects each segment of the Saint-Gobain's value chain differently, from the extraction of raw materials to their end of life. The tables below show how the opportunities and risks identified by Saint-Gobain impact each stage of the value chain while being part of global market dynamics and meeting consumer expectations. This approach has also been aligned with TCFD recommendations.

Most people continue to travel by car. |\n\n## METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION\n\n- Two models emerge: firstly, the European model, and secondly, the US model. /uni25A0\n- In Europe, the majority of the population lives in office buildings built in 2000 and converted into residential buildings in 2030. The /uni25A0 individual apartments are small, but benefit from large shared spaces (workspaces, fitness, high-tech kitchens). A centralized monitoring system automatically adapts heat, lighting, ventilation and cooling. Shared appliances in kitchens and laundry rooms are very efficient and use little energy. The roof is equipped with photovoltaic panels and the insulation has been reinforced with recycled materials.\n- In the United States, the majority of the population lives in apartment buildings and private condominiums in the suburbs of a large /uni25A0 city, in buildings dating from the 1970s. Only a minority of individual apartments have been renovated. Energy consumption is not systematically monitored. However, installations have been put in place to mitigate the effects of climate change on the comfort of residents: the insulation of the walls and roof has been improved and double-glazed windows have been installed. Most devices are programmable, but none are shared.\n\n## 'Highway to Climate Hell' scenario\n\n| SUSTAINABLE CITY       |                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Model of existing city | London, Rio de Janeiro, some US cities, Lagos, Lima, new Cairo                                                                                                                   |\n| Size                   | These immense cities occupy a vast territory and are home to three to five million inhabitants. In less developed countries, these growing cities are surrounded by large slums. |\n| Mobility               | The majority of the population lives in the suburbs and driving is the most used mode of transportation thanks to the extent of the road network.                                |\n\n## METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION\n\nSubsidized, affordable but low-quality housing is built to contain the endless expansion of slums in emerging countries. Poor quality is often accompanied by raised living spaces, a lack of daylight, thermal discomfort, high levels of noise pollution and inadequate ventilation of fresh air. Basic insulation solutions are still incompatible with the affordability required for such 'slum sanitation' approaches. Implementation of cooling processes as the only response to global warming. Access to basic services (wastewater, drinking water, electricity, sanitation, waste disposal) is an important step towards achieving the fundamental objectives of human development. Recycling, reuse and the circular economy can only be considered when these basic services have been fully realized.\n\n## Risk and opportunity management 2.1.3\n\nThe challenges related to climate change represent both risks and opportunities for Saint-Gobain. The system for identifying, assessing and managing global and local risks is detailed in Saint-Gobain's response to the CDP climate questionnaire. In this area, the Group follows the principles of reasonable diligence. This process allows to identify, prevent and mitigate actual and potential negative impacts associated with its business and supply chain, as well as to report on how these impacts are addressed. None of the risks related to climate change is of material financial significance for the Group in 2021.\n\n## Risks related to climate change 2.1.3.1\n\n## Physical risks\n\nSaint-Gobain is exposed to several types of physical risks, such as the increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme events, the rise in sea levels, the increase in average temperatures and changes in the precipitation patterns.\n\nThe Risk and Insurance Department continuously assesses the risks to which the Group's sites are exposed worldwide, and in particular the risks related to the effects of climate change (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.3.1.4 and\n\nchapter/uni00A06, section/uni00A01.1.9). The management of these risks is then reflected in the development and implementation of specific policies supporting Saint-Gobain's environmental commitments, for example in terms of water management and biodiversity (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.3.2). In addition, the Group ensures that physical risks are taken into account throughout its value chain. As part of its responsible purchasing program, Saint-Gobain relies on a diversity of suppliers and supply sources to reduce the risk of transportation difficulties and supply chain disruptions (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.2.1). Finally, the Purchasing Department considers the risk of an increase in the price of raw materials or of energy and greenhouse gas emissions in its purchasing strategies (see chapter/uni00A06, section/uni00A01.1.5).\n\n## Transition risks\n\nSaint-Gobain is committed to achieving the target of 'net zero emissions' by 2050. The Group anticipates the technological risk linked to the substitution of existing products by low-carbon options by investing in the development of disruptive technologies and eco-innovative solutions to meet the expectations of its customers. Two internal carbon prices were set up and increased in 2021 to support the viability of Saint-Gobain's projects and strategy (see this chapter, section/uni00A02.1.5.1).",

In addition, the marketing teams ensure that the Group's products comply with local environmental regulations (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.4.1). Similarly, the risks of climate change disputes are assessed as  part  of  the  existing  risk  management  process.  In addition, Saint-Gobain monitors changes  in  climate reporting requirements in order to meet the expectations of its stakeholders (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.4.1).\n\nFinally,  aware  of  the  impact  of  a  bad  reputation  on environmental matters, the Group fully integrates reputational risk into its overall risk management policy. Saint-Gobain  is  demonstrating  its  commitment  to  the climate  through  concrete  targets  for  reducing  its  CO2 emissions and energy consumption. Finally, the needs and risks related to access to water for local populations are systematically taken into account in its action plans.\n\n## Opportunities 2.1.3.2\n\n## Improve resource management and energy efficiency\n\nSaint-Gobain  anticipates  the  risk  of  a  scarcity  of  raw materials by actively promoting the transition towards a circular economy (see this chapter, section/uni00A02.2.1) and by reducing  its water  consumption  (see  this  chapter, section/uni00A03.3.2.2). The substitution of non-renewable virgin raw materials with renewable or recycled raw materials, the extension of the lifespan or use of our products or systems and the reduction of the intensity of materials are at the heart of the Group's innovation process and enable it  to  ensure  the  competitiveness  of  its  solutions  while anticipating  changes  in  the  preferences  of  its  end consumers and legislations.\n\nSaint-Gobain is also working to optimize and reduce its energy consumption through such means as investing in digital tools to adjust energy consumption as closely as possible to needs (see chapter/uni00A02, section/uni00A03.3.2.4).\n\n## Develop sustainable solutions\n\nAnticipation of the increase in the cost of high-emission products, which would follow the tightening of regulations and the change in preferences expected by consumers and customers, encourages Saint-Gobain to support the development  of  low-carbon  materials  and  methods throughout its value chain (see chapter/uni00A02, section/uni00A03.1). In addition to its efforts to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations, the Group promotes renewable energies and develops solutions to improve the energy efficiency of its customers in order to enable them to meet the climate and  environmental  challenges  they  face  (see  chapter/uni00A02, section/uni00A01.1.1). Moreover, thanks to its strong exposure to the renovation market, the Group is ideally situated to play a  decisive  role  in  the  national  and  European  'green recovery'  plans  for  the  energy  transition,  which  should support Saint-Gobain's structural growth (see chapter/uni00A02, section/uni00A01.2.1).\n\n## Solutions 2.1.4\n\n## Designing innovative solutions 2.1.4.1 incorporating \"carbon benefits\"\n\nSaint-Gobain is innovating to develop solutions to reduce the  carbon  footprint  of  buildings  throughout  their  life cycle:\n\n- by  reducing  their  energy  consumption  during  the /uni25A0 utilization  phase;  these  are  insulation  and  glazing solutions that improve energy efficiency;\n- by  reducing  the  carbon  impact  of  its  products  and /uni25A0 solutions,  particularly  by  developing  lighter  building solutions, increasing the amount of recycled materials used  to  manufacture  them  or  by  using  renewable energy to power its industrial processes.\n\nA  web  platform  called  Green  Buildings  Saint-Gobain enables the Group's customers to evaluate the contribution  of  its  products  and  solutions  to  obtaining LEED, BREEAM, WELL or international HQE certifications.\n\nEnergy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of products are two criteria incorporated into the methodology  for  evaluating  sustainable  solutions  under the  Solutions  for  Growth  program  (see  this  chapter, section 3.4.4).\n\n## Measure the \"carbon benefits\" 2.1.4.2 of products and solutions\n\nThe  innovative  solutions  developed  by  Saint-Gobain  to improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings  lessen  the negative impacts of the construction sector on the climate and cut occupants' energy bills, while enhancing well-being. They therefore play an important role in the fight  against  climate  change,  as  they  allow  through  a reduction of energy demand to decrease the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted. Thus, the benefits offered by the Group's thermal insulation products and glass exceed significantly the impacts associated to their production in terms  of  energy  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas emissions.\n\nAfter  an  initial  calculation  carried  out  in  2015  at  the conference  COP21,  Saint-Gobain  decided,  in  2021,  to update and improve the methodology used to calculate the quantity of greenhouse gases avoided thanks to the use of its own solutions, in order to:\n\n- comply with the most recent and recognized /uni25A0 international  recommendations  for  the  calculation  of prevented greenhouse gas emissions;\n- extend the geographic coverage of the evaluation. /uni25A0\n\nSaint-Gobain has estimated that nearly 1,300 million tons of  emissions  were  avoided  thanks  to  the  solutions produced and sold in one year. The updated methodology is available  to  all  stakeholders  on  the  Saint-Gobain website.  This  calculation  has  been  reviewed  by  an independent third party.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "Maximize the contribution for the planet and communities\n\n## Codeveloping solutions for new markets 2.1.4.3 linked to the low-carbon economy\n\nIn response to the challenges of population growth and urbanization, it is imperative  to  design  sustainable solutions and contribute to the construction of resilient cities that ensure the well-being of individuals in a context of resource scarcity and climate change. New lightweight constructive  methods  can  be  used  to  meet  these challenges.  The  development  of  prefabricated  solutions or \"off-site\" construction  favors  the  use  of  lighter construction methods using wood or metal structures, as alternatives to traditional constructions based on cement and brick. Saint-Gobain is also investing in 3D printing (see chapter/uni00A02, section/uni00A03.3.2.3).\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy is also impacting markets  related  to  mobility  and  energy.  Thus,  the 'Mobility' Business Unit is working both on solutions to support customers in the transition to vehicles that emit less  and  less  CO2  and  on  adapting  its  offer  to  the development of hybrid or 100% electric vehicles.\n\n## The '2050 net zero carbon 2.1.5 emissions' program\n\nIn addition to the programs initiated at site level, reducing the carbon footprint of production and thus the impact of the products requires three major strategies:\n\n- an internal carbon price to speed up the transition to /uni25A0 low-carbon technologies;\n- innovation  and  R&D  programs  to  coordinate  and /uni25A0 expand  efforts  to  improve  manufacturing  processes, reduce  the  energy  consumptions  and  ensure  the transition towards the use of decarbonized energies;\n- scope/uni00A03 control to identify the main emissions factors /uni25A0 and mitigate the overall impact of the products.\n\nIn 2020, and in accordance with the Group's commitment to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  2050,  Saint-Gobain published a roadmap with an action plan and intermediate targets for the end of 2030 (see chapter/uni00A04, section/uni00A02.1).\n\n## An internal carbon price to speed up the 2.1.5.1 transition to low-carbon technologies\n\nSetting an internal carbon price enables the current or potential impact  of  a  regulatory  carbon  price  on Saint-Gobain's activities to be assessed, opportunities for growth in low-carbon sectors to be identified, investments in manufacturing and R&D to be refocused, and actions to reduce CO2 emissions to be ranked. The Group set two levels of internal carbon prices in 2016. The first internal carbon  price  level  per  ton  is  applied  to  industrial investments  above  a  certain  threshold,  investments associated  with  a  change  in  energy  source,  energy investments on an existing or greenfield site with a total\n\nannual energy consumption of over 10/uni00A0GWh. The second carbon  price  level  is  used  for  R&D  investment  in breakthrough technology. This price level is of demonstrable  value in supporting low-carbon R&D projects.\n\nFollowing the November 2020 publication of the 2030 roadmap,  an  update  of  the  price  levels  was  made  in October/uni00A02021. The price level applicable to investments rose  from  \u20ac30  to  \u20ac75  per  ton  of  CO2  and  the  level applicable to R&D projects from \u20ac100 to \u20ac150 per ton. In addition,  a  specific  approach  applicable  to  significant acquisitions  has  been  defined.  It  includes  any  effort required  to  ensure  that  the  carbon  impact  of  this acquisition is compatible with Saint-Gobain's direct and indirect emissions target trajectory.\n\nUnder the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS),  the  rules  defining  the  free  allocation  of  carbon allowances  from  2021  have  been  redefined.  Discussions are still underway within the framework of the \"Fit for 55\" package  to  define  the  trajectory  after  2025.  Based  on current information, the Group believes that it will be able to maintain self-sufficiency in quotas in the medium term given its current stock level of more than/uni00A05.8 million tons of  allocations,  corresponding  to  3.7  million  tons  of allocations in the registries at the end of 2021 plus the allocations to be received at the beginning of 2022 for the year 2021.\n\n## Innovate to optimize industrial processes 2.1.5.2 and promote the use of decarbonized energies\n\nIn  the  short  term,  the  actions  performed  involve  the reduction of energy consumption and, in the medium and long  term,  the  transition  to  the  use  of  decarbonized energy,  in  particular  the  transition  to  the  use  of  green electricity. The WCM  program  (see  this chapter, section/uni00A03.3.1.2) and the 'energy' and 'CO2' action plans for continuing improvement (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.3.1.2) provide structure for the action plans.\n\nShort- and medium-term actions also include investments in optimization and energy efficiency processes. Pragmatically, Saint-Gobain identifies and analyzes projects  for  which  rapid  gains  can  be  measured.  The analysis also takes into account the impact on competitiveness  and  applies  the  rules  related  to  the introduction of the internal carbon price. For example, the Group  promotes  the  installation  of  energy  and  heat recovery systems. These low-carbon solutions can address each of the impacts of industrial production: raw materials, energy use, energy efficiency and energy recovery, and carbon capture and recovery.\n\nFinally, the development of \"Industry 4.0\" (see chapter/uni00A02, section/uni00A03.3.2.5), and in particular the collection and use of data, makes it possible to optimize energy consumption.",

        "page_content": "Regarding energy, processes that are technically adaptable to the exclusive use of electrical energy have been  identified.  For  these  processes,  the  transition  is facilitated by  the  development  of  local  renewable electricity grids and the growing share of decarbonized electricity in national grids. Energy buyers have therefore been  involved  in  identifying  reliable  and  competitive sources  of  green  electricity  in  the  countries  in  which Saint-Gobain  operates.  This  transition  to  the  use  of decarbonized energies takes the form of investments such as the installation of solar panels and wind farms in India that generate around 45/uni00A0GWh of renewable electricity or the use of market mechanisms such as green certificates or  Power  Purchase  Agreements  (PPAs).  Thanks  to  its agreement  with  Blooming  Grove  Wind  Farm,  in  2020 Saint-Gobain North America was able to reduce its carbon emissions by/uni00A08.4% in North America in 2021.\n\nFor  processes  for  which  the  adaptation  to  the  use  of electrical energy is technically more complex, two axes of innovation are then deployed: one on the development of carbon-free energies (biogas, biomethane or hydrogen for example); and the other, to develop processes and make them  compatible  with  an  increasing  use  of  green electricity.\n\nOverall, innovation is a lever used by the Group to reduce the impact of its activities (see chapter 2, section 3.3.1.5).\n\nSaint-Gobain also wants to develop carbon-neutral plants as quickly as possible. For example, in May/uni00A02021 the Group announced an investment of \u20ac25/uni00A0million in its plasterboard plant at Fredrikstad, Norway, to increase its production capacity by around 40% and transform its plant into the first  carbon-neutral  plasterboard  production  site  in  the world. Saint-Gobain receives a grant from the Norwegian government  agency  Enova;  the  new  facilities  will  be operational in early 2023.\n\nTo support this effort towards carbon-neutral industrial processes,  a  budget  of  \u20ac100/uni00A0million  per  year  has  been allocated  to  CAPEX  and  research  and  development investments for the next ten years. This budget has been invested in 2021.\n\n## Control of scope/uni00A03 2.1.5.3\n\nScope/uni00A03 emissions are indirect emissions that are generated  in  a  company's  value  chain.  Given  the complexity  of  the  value  chains,  the  assessment  of emissions  is  a  challenge  and  the  improvement  of  data quality is essential in the context of the commitment to carbon neutrality. For this reason, Saint-Gobain's updated scope/uni00A03 emissions assessment in 2021 has been accompanied by a more specific assessment of emissions factors and a more granular analysis of impacts on the three most significant categories:\n\n- purchases of raw materials (category 1); /uni25A0\n- transport and logistics (categories 4 and 9); /uni25A0\n- purchases related to trade activities (category 1). /uni25A0\n\nThus, in 2021, the Group's  scope  3  is  estimated at/uni00A021.3/uni00A0Mteq CO2  compared  to  the  2017  base  used  to\n\nvalidate  the  2030  targets  by  SBTi  (17.3  Mteq  CO2). Excluding  the  broader  coverage  of  impacts,  scope  3 would be estimated at 16.8 Mteq CO2 in 2021. Saint-Gobain publishes its emissions by scope 3 emissions category in the CDP Climate.\n\nIn line with its commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050 and its objective of reducing its scope 3 by 16% by 2030 validated  by  SBTi  -  compared  to  2017,  the  Group  will continue its efforts to increase transparency and improve the assessment of impacts on its value chain through the mobilization  of  its  teams  and  in  collaboration  with  its suppliers.\n\nSaint-Gobain  has  implemented  digital  tools  to  make assessment of scope 3 more reliable. The methods used to assess  carbon  emissions  and  integrate  emission  factors have  been  coordinated  globally.  The  scope  3  program involves suppliers in negotiations conducted by the trade and non-trade purchasing teams.\n\nThe  objective  is  to  identify  common  approaches  and innovations that Saint-Gobain could support to accelerate their availability.\n\n5 principles are implemented by the purchasing teams and environmental experts:\n\n- a  digital  tool  available  to  teams  at  local  and  global /uni25A0 levels to enable them to estimate scope 3 emissions;\n- communication kits to share the challenges and targets /uni25A0 of the fight against climate change with suppliers;\n- the  collection  of  information  by  suppliers  on  their /uni25A0 emissions on the basis of life cycle analyses verified by independent third parties;\n- the integration of the maturity of suppliers regarding /uni25A0 their climate commitment into the overall assessment of their performance;\n- the  creation  of  joint  action  plans  with  suppliers  to /uni25A0 reduce their carbon impact.\n\nThis systemization  will  continue  to  make  scope  3 assessments more reliable. It also structures action plans to accelerate the reduction of emissions. Best practices have been identified and shared with all Group buyers. For example, a guide listing the most reliable eco-labels was shared in 2021.\n\n## Collaboration with stakeholders 2.1.6\n\n## Strong commitments to the climate 2.1.6.1\n\nSaint-Gobain is fully committed as a non-state actor to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and participates with its partners in the subsequent COP (Conferences of the  Parties).  In  November/uni00A02021,  during  the  COP26  in Glasgow, Saint-Gobain took part in the global mobilization in the industry for a decarbonized construction and further contribute to a more circular economy, by organizing a series of round table meetings on the subject before and during the COP, with several speeches, in particular from Benoit Bazin and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "## An efficient and responsible Group\n\nMaximize the contribution for the planet and communities\n\nIn preparation  for  this  COP,  and  in  line  with  its commitment to carbon neutrality, Saint-Gobain has been involved in the 'Race to Zero' initiative since its creation, and in the 'We Mean Business' coalition, which now brings together more than 5,000 companies and 1,000 cities.\n\nSaint-Gobain  is  campaigning  for  the  introduction  of  a carbon price. This price must allow for a transition that keeps  the  level  playing  field  between  the  various companies  and  countries,  in  particular  through  the establishment of a mechanism at the borders of Europe. Saint-Gobain has contributed to several projects on the subject at the European level within the ERT (European Round Table for Industry) and within the AFEP and the Fabrique de l'Industrie in France. In 2021, Saint-Gobain also joined the steering committee of the World Bank's Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition.\n\nThe  European  Union  has  a  leadership  role  on  climate issues  at  the  global  level,  which  is  reflected  in  the establishment  of  an  ambitious  regulatory  framework. Saint-Gobain supports the implementation of the 'Fit for 55' package, which will lead to an increase in ambition by 2030,  by  co-signing  several  letters  in  2020  and  2021, endorsed by broad coalitions of players, notably via the Corporate Leadership Group. As part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, Saint-Gobain is a member of the Alliance of companies for water and climate change. This initiative supports the actions of cities and watersheds involved in the  sustainable  management  of  water  resources  and adaptation to the consequences of climate change.\n\n## Actions that support strong 2.1.6.2 and low-carbon economic growth\n\nSaint-Gobain  belongs  to  the  ETC  (Energy  Transition Commission),  a  group  of  about  fifty  leaders  from  the energy and climate community. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar is one of the commissioners. The aim of the ETC is to accelerate the shift towards a low-carbon energy system that enables robust economic growth, while limiting global warming  to  1.5\u00b0  C.  Because  construction  is  its  primary market, the Group is particularly involved in the promotion of sustainable construction and is involved in initiatives to promote energy efficiency.\n\nAll over the world, an ambitious political framework makes it possible  to  remove  technical  as  well  as  financial obstacles to the transformation of cities and buildings to make them sustainable. For example, this is the case at the European  level:  Saint-Gobain  is  a  member  of  various initiatives  and  coalitions,  and  in  particular  has  been  a member  of  the  LEVEL(S)  steering  committee  since  its inception. The committee is an instrument developed by the European Commission in conjunction with the industry and the public sector and aims to establish a 'common language' for sustainable construction, in order to take it beyond energy efficiency. In December/uni00A02017, the European Commission launched the pilot phase of LEVEL(S), which continued in 2021.\n\nTransforming  markets  also  means  changing  the  entire construction  market  value  chain.  The  Group  forges partnerships with many players who share the same desire to promote more sustainable buildings. In this respect, the Green Building Councils (GBC), a unique global network of national associations of professionals and players in the\n\nconstruction  market,  are  an  essential  partner.  The  GBC network  offers  a  fast  path  for  the  deployment  of sustainable  construction  technologies  and  dissemination of good practices, particularly via education for market players. It can create a collective momentum involving the various  stakeholders  (investors,  builders,  manufacturers, architects, etc.).\n\nGBCs have a geographical organization that allows each of Saint-Gobain's  units, at the local, national, and international levels, to actively contribute to their work. The Group is a member of 40 local GBCs worldwide, a partner of the European network of GBCs (ERN), and has chaired the Corporate Advisory Board of the World Green Building Council (WGBC) since 2017.\n\nSaint-Gobain  is committed  to  orienting  the  global construction industry toward a low-carbon trajectory. This is why Saint-Gobain is a founding member of the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GABC). Saint-Gobain is also a member of the projects steering committee of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) for cities and buildings. Saint-Gobain is also involved in various initiatives to help cities lead this transition, for example by being a member of the steering committee of the 'Zero Carbon Building Accelerator' of the World Resources Institute.\n\n## Train clients locally, inform the end user 2.1.6.3\n\nSome of the training courses delivered by local teams (see chapter/uni00A02, section/uni00A03.6) cover energy efficiency and reduction of environmental impact of buildings. The entity \"building distribution\" is particularly active in that area and plays  a  key  role  in  supporting  craftsmen,  thereby facilitating the marketing and use of sustainable products. These services set up by distribution help accelerate the transition to a more sustainable construction and reduce the carbon impact of buildings.\n\nIn France, the Point.P network has implemented 'Energy Efficiency' counters in over 130 branches. Salespeople are specifocally  trained  and  tools  such  as  a  simulator  to evaluate a project's energy efficiency are made available to customers. A training program on ways to save energy in the construction industry is offered (FeeBat), along with a  support  mechanism  for  official  recognition  of  the effectiveness of the steps taken called Renoprim +.\n\nBeyond  building  distribution,  training  structures  are offered by country. They are open to craftsmen, installers, architects and other actors of the building sector. They can  also  be  associated  with  professional  schools.  In France, the sales and marketing teams are involved with eight apprenticeship training centers (CFAs) for partnerships for training services or support for trainers specific  to  the  establishment.  A  website  dedicated  to training (seformeravecsaint-gobain.com) offers opportunities of training via e-learning or in person. Guides called  ' Les  essentiels  de  l'habitat '  allow  craftsmen  and professionals  to  train  and  learn  about  topics  such  as energy efficiency or the evolution of tomorrow's norms and standards for sustainable construction.\n\nIn  Morocco,  the  Group  has  developed  a  Saint-Gobain academy including three training centers with the aim of training  more  than  3,000  professionals  in  sustainable construction.",

The Group has decided to go further, with the creation of the Climate Academy, to help employees meet environmental challenges  regardless  of  their  level  of  expertise  on  the subject or their role in the company. The Climate Academy has  been  designed  in  two  stages.  The  first  one  to understand, with five themes divided into several modules of no more than five minutes, the urgency of acting to preserve the planet, how man has modified the ecosystem, the consequences on the climate, the role of biodiversity and the exploitation of natural resources. The first two themes were available since November/uni00A02021. As for the second stage of the Climate Academy, it will consist of eight themes describing the various means of acting to protect the environment and achieving carbon neutrality in 2050.\n\n## An internal carbon fund for employees\n\nTo  engage  all  its  employees  on  the  road  to  carbon neutrality  by  2050,  and  to  contribute  to  achieving  the objective of reducing the Group's CO2 emissions between now  and  2030,  in  April/uni00A02021,  Saint-Gobain  launched  an internal \"Carbon Fund\". First implemented in a pilot region, Northern Europe, it aims to accelerate the reduction of non-industrial CO2 emissions through the daily actions of employees and targeted investments in sites. The areas covered by these investments are mainly related to the sustainable mobility of employees, renewable energies and the  improvement  of  comfort  and  energy  efficiency  at Saint-Gobain sites. These projects proposed and selected by employees concern their working environment.\n\n## Objectives and performance 2.1.7 measurement\n\nSaint-Gobain has set targets and implemented a set of indicators to monitor its climate change performance. The carbon-related targets are detailed in the 'Carbon 2030' roadmap. It should be noted that the Group's impact on greenhouse gases is limited to the carbon impact, given that the emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 are not significant.\n\nAll other objectives and indicators that the Group uses to make progress in mitigating, managing and adapting to climate change issues are presented in a detailed table in chapter/uni00A04.  The  2030  targets  based  on  2017  have  been validated by the independent organization Science Based Target  initiative  (SBTi)  and  submitted  to  the  external auditors. Details of the methodology for calculating the indicators and targets are available in chapter/uni00A09, section/uni00A02.1.\n\nDetails of scope 3 emissions by category are available in Saint-Gobain's response to the CDP Climate questionnaire.\n\nThe assessment of scope 3 emissions, predictive scenarios to  the  climate  change  effects,  the  measurement  and effectiveness of carbon  offsetting actions and  the methodology for assessing avoidance are all topics that are still being debated by experts. Saint-Gobain participates in initiatives to standardize climate reporting procedures. The Group is also keen to engage in dialogue with expert organizations with a view to improving the measurement  of  impacts  in  order  to  make  the  fight against climate change more effective.\n\nThe classification of Saint-Gobain's activities in the context of  the  European  regulation  on  sustainable  finance  and compliance  with  the  European  regulation  \"2020/852 Taxonomy  Regulation\"  (in  force  since  July  2020),  the delegated  acts  to  the  first  two  objectives  regarding climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  -  \"Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act (EU) 2021/2139\"- as well as the delegated act to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and its annexes on reporting requirements (\"Disclosures Delegated Act\") is disclosed in chapter 9, section 3.5.1.\n\nThe  proportion  of  Saint-Gobain's  turnover  linked  to sustainable  solutions  is  estimated  at  72%  in  2020.  It includes  activities  that  have  not  been  assessed  in  the context  of  compliance  with  the  European  \"2020/852 Taxonomy Regulation\", such as distribution activities, and impacts and benefits that have not yet been included in the  regulation,  such  as  resources  and  the  circular economy, as well as benefits related to health, safety and comfort, which will potentially be eligible for the social taxonomy.\n\n3",

The circular economy is a  model  adapted  to  the  scarcity  of  non-renewable resources and to changes in society such as urbanization and demographic changes. This model is applied closer to the  markets  and  at  the  territorial  level.  A  successful transition  towards  the  circular  economy  will  make  it possible to offer solutions and services over the long term which take into account environmental, social and societal expectations and which balance well-being, sustainability and performance for stakeholders.\n\nIn addition to limiting the depletion of natural resources, moving  towards  greater  circularity  in  the  economy generates positive effects on other environmental issues, such  as  reducing  pollution,  protecting  biodiversity  and accelerating the decarbonization of the economy.\n\n## Strategy for a transition towards 2.2.1 a circular economy\n\nTo accelerate the transition towards the circular economy, Saint-Gobain's strategy is based on four main areas to minimize the impact of Saint-Gobain's operations on its entire value chain and maximize the profits of solutions while maintaining the value of resources at the highest level:\n\n- the  circular  management  of  the  supply  chain  and /uni25A0 operations: elaborate more efficient production processes in terms of resources by ensuring that the use  of  non-renewable  natural  resources  is  limited, sourcing  responsibly  managed  renewable  resources and limiting the final waste from production;\n- the recovery of resources after the use of products: /uni25A0 create recycling channels by initiating or participating in  initiatives  with  all  stakeholders  to  promote  the recovery  and  recycling  of  construction  materials  or materials  from  the  industrial  markets  in  which  the Group operates;\n- a range of solutions that optimize the use of natural /uni25A0 resources: by ensuring the recyclability of products and encouraging  the  integration  of  recycled  materials throughout the product life cycle (including end-of-life management), but also by integrating the extension of the product's useful life or the increase of the utilization rate of products  in  the  offers,  for  example  by encouraging  the  modularity  of  buildings,  anticipating deconstruction  for  optimum  recycling  or  reuse  of materials,  but  also  by  involving  the  stakeholders (through information and training of customers).\n\nThus,  the  Group's  transition  to  a  circular  economy  is beneficial for the environment as it reduces the pressure on non-renewable resources and ensures the regeneration of renewable  resources,  it  also  helps  reduce  CO2 emissions.\n\nWhile responsible resources management is the subject of a Group-wide policy, action plans for the transition to a circular economy are highly dependent on countries, the maturity of stakeholders and local logistics. Approaches are therefore deployed by activity in order to involve the various sectors, in each country.\n\n## Develop the offer of products, 2.2.2 solutions and services\n\nThe  gradual  emergence  of  the  circular  economy  is changing value chains and ecosystems. From the design of  products,  solutions  and  services  to  the  benefits expected by customers and end-users, and the management of product end-of-life, Saint-Gobain's offering must adapt to new methods: incorporating more recycled or renewable materials to reduce the consumption of virgin raw materials and the consequences  of  their  use,  particularly  on  biodiversity; extending the life of products to reduce their environmental  impact;  and  facilitating  the  recycling  or reuse of products at the end of their life to successfully meet  market  needs  with  a  limited  impact  on  natural resources.\n\nThus, the portfolio of products and solutions offered by Saint-Gobain is analyzed transversally under the responsibility of the marketing teams with three priorities:\n\n- the  substitution  of  raw  materials  by  recycled  or /uni25A0 renewable materials, including packaging;\n- the  development  of  formulations  to  reduce  their /uni25A0 content of hazardous substances until their complete replacement, thus avoiding the dissemination of materials generated during the recycling process;\n- the improvement of the recyclability and reusability of /uni25A0 products  and  systems,  including  their  packaging,  by integrating repairability and ease of disassembly at the end of life.\n\nLikewise, product design incorporates these eco-innovation principles.\n\nMost of the Group's business lines are working to reduce the resource intensity of their products, by reducing the average  weight  for  the  same  unit  of  product,  without affecting  technical  performances.  This  is  the  case,  for example,  for  car  windshields  and  plasterboard.  Several countries have already implemented the BANTAM program, which aims to reduce the weight of plasterboard by working on industrial processes and product formulations. Some factories have been able to reduce the weight  of  their  standard  boards  by  more  than  20% compared to their initial weight. The SLIMWOOL program, deployed  since  2028  worldwide,  aims  to  optimize  the weight  of  glass  wool,  while  guaranteeing  the  product's thermal performance.\n\nThe actions deployed concern not only the products but also their packaging. Action plans have been deployed to reduce  packaging  globally  and  to  ensure  that  it  is recyclable.  Consequently,  marketing  teams  and  buyers have  been  working  together  to  change  packaging materials  or  design  to  encourage  recycling  in  existing channels. Saint-Gobain has set a target of 100% recyclable packaging  by  2030.  In  2021,  69%  of  packaging  is recyclable.",

        "page_content": "Finally, because construction already accounts for 40% of the world's resource consumption, Saint-Gobain is actively and  collaboratively involved in discussions on the evolution  of  construction  methods  towards  lightweight construction solutions that use fewer materials for at least the same performance.\n\nThe criterion of optimizing natural resources is one of the identified benefits in the Solutions for Growth program (see this chaper, section 3.4.4). This criterion includes both limiting  the  use  of  natural  resources  and  incorporating recycled materials into product compositions.\n\n## Develop manufacturing processes 2.2.3\n\nReducing the consumption of raw materials per functional unit  produced  and  the  waste  generated  by  industrial processes  are  the  pillars  of  the  sustainable  resources management  policy  initiated  in  2015  (see  this  chapter, section 3.3.2.3) with the aim of moving towards the \"zero unrecovered waste\".\n\nSynergies between the Group's various industrial processes are used to optimize the reuse of waste and by-products. In the countries where Saint-Gobain operates,  teams  are  gradually  setting  up  services  to recover  waste  from  customers'  activities,  in  particular waste from renovation or demolition/deconstruction. This waste is collected, sorted and reprocessed before being reused  in  the  industrial  process  instead  of  natural  raw materials.\n\nOverall synergies are possible across the businesses for each  process  or  raw  material  to  identify  the  deposits, material  qualities  or  even  good  technical  practices  and favorable technical innovations by country. Cross-business working groups including the manufacturing and technical departments, purchases, sustainable development experts on  the  collection  and  processing  of  recycled  materials have been set up to develop these global synergies.\n\nThe  search  to  replace  as  many  non-recyclable  raw materials as possible is part of the industrial performance improvement program (see this chapter, section 3.3.1.2). The aim of these replacements must be to maintain the quality and competitiveness of the products and solutions and  even improving them while reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nFor flat glass, the recycling of window glass, facade glass or automotive glass is infinitely possible as long as the collected glass elements meet the quality requirements of a float furnace, in particular that contaminants of all kinds are eliminated. The integration into products is therefore mainly  dependent  on  the  existence  of  efficient  and sustainable collection networks, which are able to ensure a sorting that meets the desired quality specifications.\n\nFor plaster, once the contaminants have been eliminated, the reprocessing of waste from the building is done by grinding and separating the paper present on both sides of the board. If the plaster itself is indefinitely recyclable, the presence of paper on both sides of the board causes a negative impact on the manufacturing process and must therefore  be  eliminated  as  much  as  possible.  Some Saint-Gobain factories now reach 30% recycled content, mainly from construction or demolition plaster waste.\n\n## Develop new business models 2.2.4 and value chains\n\nIn many countries, Saint-Gobain is developing services for its customers which include waste and construction waste retrieval. Collected glass is recycled and used to make glazing or glass wool. Likewise, plaster waste collected can be recycled to make new plasterboards.\n\nThe presence in a country of distribution activities adds local synergies through the option of installing collection points close to sales outlets, making it easier to recycle customers' waste.\n\nAll of these services are provided directly by Saint-Gobain companies or in partnership with third-party companies.\n\nThe  principles  of  the  circular  economy  differ  in  each country  and  region  of  the  world.  These  developments depend on a great variety of factors, such as modes of consumption, infrastructure and the industrial fabric, the legal context and the technical and logistical conditions of waste management.\n\nSaint-Gobain organizations in the countries spearhead or take part in initiatives with local stakeholders: industrial initiatives involving an area, customers, and local authorities or communities.\n\nAs  part  of  their  professional  channels,  Saint-Gobain's \"Gypsum\"  and  \"Flat  Glass  for  Buildings\"  entities  have signed commitments with the French public authorities on the recycling of waste plaster and glass.\n\nMoreover, Saint-Gobain Distribution B\u00e2timent France has been organized to take back waste from the same types of construction materials, products and equipement that it sells to professionals since January 1, 2017, becoming the leading private network of collection points for construction site waste. In its CSR roadmap, Saint-Gobain Distribution  B\u00e2timent  France  has  included  a  pillar  on construction site waste management.\n\nSince 2019, the Group has launched its I-LOOP project, supported  by  the  European  Union  through  its  LIFE funding  program.  This  project  aims  to  contribute  to gradually  recovering  glass  wool  waste  generated  on building  or  demolition  sites,  which  currently  goes  to landfill.  It  offers  an  innovative  solution  for  closed  loop recycling,  that  can  transform  waste  into  a  high-quality secondary raw material that is used to manufacture new glass  wool.  The  project  aims  to  offer  building  industry players new value chains to recycle glass wool in France, Benelux  and  part  of  Scandinavia,  which  will  be  a cost-effective alternative to landfill.\n\nThe industrial sectors are also developing new services linked  to  the  circular  economy.  The  Ceramics  Business Unit has created the Valoref activity, specialized in the treatment  and  recovery  of  refractory  brick  waste.  The recovery of waste is carried out mainly during the repair or reconstruction of glass furnaces. A global waste management service is offered to customers upstream of furnace repair or reconstruction sites. Valoref ensures the collection, treatment and recovery of waste from the sites. Around two-thirds of the waste collected is recycled in the refractory production chain. The other recovery circuits are  the  manufacture  of  construction  materials  such  as mortars  or  tiles,  and  other  industrial  additives.  In  2021, 36,150 tons of refractory waste were managed by Valoref.\n\n3",

Saint-Gobain's employment footprint can therefore be measured at three levels:\n\n- direct jobs, which take into account jobs paid by the /uni25A0 Group;\n- indirect jobs, which take into account jobs generated /uni25A0 by Saint-Gobain's purchases from suppliers and subcontractors;\n- induced  jobs,  which  take  into  account  employment /uni25A0 triggered  by  purchases  within  the  national  economy made by direct employees of the Group through the wages  they  receive  and  by  the  employees  of Saint-Gobain's  suppliers  to  the  extent  of  activity prompted by the Group's purchases.\n\nIn 2016, EY conducted a study for Saint-Gobain of the indirect  jobs  and  jobs  generated  by  the  Group,  which covered data for 2015 and more than 90% of the Group's purchases. The study concluded that for 170,500 direct jobs in 2015, Saint-Gobain generated more than 549,000 indirect  jobs,  in  addition  to  more  than  190,000  jobs induced.\n\n## Inclusive and societal actions 2.3.1.2\n\nThe  Group's  organization  is  based  on  strong  local decision-making  autonomy  (see  chapter  1,  section  5.1.1) and active collaboration with communities. As a result, the deployment of global diversity and inclusion programs or programs  with  a  social  dimension  is  adapted  to  local situations  to  optimize  their  positive  impacts  for  local populations.  This  is  the  case,  for  example,  for  the deployment  of  the  'health'  pillar  of  the  Care  by Saint-Gobain  program  (see  this  chapter,  section/uni00A04.3.2). This program guarantees the reimbursement of 80% of employees'  medical  expenses  (general  medicine  and hospitalization). The objective is to have all employees and their  families  (over  500,000  potential  beneficiaries)  by early 2023. The implementation of this program promotes the creation or improvement of local health networks in regions  where  access  to  quality  services  is  sometimes non-existent.\n\nThe  Group  maintains  relationships  with  local  partners wherever it operates. It takes part in actions to stimulate local employment, support disadvantaged populations in the professional world and participate in the improvement of  living  places.  In  the  numerous  countries  where  it  is present, Saint-Gobain develops solutions adapted to the poorest populations. Programs are initiated locally depending on the particular situations of each country. The solutions proposed meet the criteria of sustainable\n\nand comfortable solutions, with particular attention paid to  the  cost  price  of  housing  and  the  ease  of  use  of materials, the  energy  efficiency  obtained  making  it possible to offer future occupants an improved quality of life at a controlled cost. These programs are deployed in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, Central America and India.\n\n## A network of players contributing 2.3.2 to inclusive action\n\nThe  various  Saint-Gobain  entities,  in  their  respective scopes and in line with their key local issues, are active in sponsorship  and  philanthropy  in  the  Group's  reference markets, and also in areas such as education, research, culture or health. To develop these actions, Saint-Gobain relies on local partnerships, in particular with non-profit organizations or associations.\n\nSaint-Gobain has invested \u20ac15/uni00A0million in 2021 for philanthropy and sponsorship actions. This involves either direct  financial  support  or  donations  of  materials.  Each entity and each country makes its own choices to support projects according to local issues.\n\nThis takes the form of financial donations, donations of materials, skill-based sponsorship or volunteer work. All of these actions with a strong local social impact are not systematically reported by the Group at te global level. Only  a  portion  of  financial  donations  and  donations  of materials is reported. The number of beneficiaries is also only  partially  assessed.  The  financial  impact  does  not include  skill-based  sponsorship  or  the  participation  of employees in action during their working hours.\n\n## The Saint-Gobain Foundation 2.3.2.1\n\nThe  Saint-Gobain  International  Corporate  Foundation  is based on employee commitment. All Group employees both current and retired - can sponsor solidarity actions in two areas:\n\n- the professional integration of young adults in difficulty; /uni25A0\n- the  construction,  improvement  or  renovation,  in  the /uni25A0 general interest, of living places for people in precarious situations, contributing in particular to reducing energy consumption and preserving the environment.\n\nProjects must be carried out by a non-profit organization and be located near a Saint-Gobain site. The Foundation provides direct financial support to the projects selected, thanks to an annual allocation that was increased in 2020 to \u20ac2/uni00A0million invested  in  the  projects.  In  addition, employee  or  retired  sponsors  facilitate  an  association's access  to  additional  partnerships  such  as  donations  of materials, access to technical expertise in energy efficiency and other areas, and volunteer work.\n\nSince its creation in 2008, the Foundation has supported/uni00A0320 projects, including/uni00A039 in 2021. The global pandemic has had an impact on the Foundation's projects; some of the projects supported had to be postponed by the associations.",

        "page_content": "## Local Foundations 2.3.2.2\n\nIn North America, the Saint-Gobain Corporation Foundation is active in organizing three programs:\n\n- matching  gifts,  allowing  up  to  50%  of  employees' /uni25A0 personal  donations  to  NGOs  or  to  education  to  be matched;\n- community gifts, whereby each industrial site located in /uni25A0 the United States or Canada makes a contribution to the  benefit  of  a  local  community;  donations  and initiatives  are  left  to  the  discretion  of  the  sites, according to local priorities and needs;\n- direct  grants,  programs  of  direct  support  to  certain /uni25A0 non-governmental organizations for social and societal development, improving energy efficiency and preserving the environment.\n\nIn India, the Saint-Gobain India Foundation's mission is to improve the living conditions of the most disadvantaged populations  by  supporting  education-related  projects, targeted particularly at young girls. It is also active in the areas of learning, health and  the  environment.  In partnership  with  18  NGOs,  around  9,500  young  girls benefit from these programs each year.\n\n## Actions to promote professional 2.3.3 integration and education\n\nIn addition to the programs supported by the Saint-Gobain  Foundation,  many  countries  have  set  up partnerships  to  train  young  people,  in  the  building professions especially.\n\nIn North America, the Group has built a partnership with the  NGO  YouthBuild  USA  in  response  to  a  twofold ambition: providing training for out-of-school young adults with  the  opportunity  to  learn  green  habitat  skills  while earning their high school equivalences. Thus, since 2011, the Group has been involved in the integration of young\n\npeople  into  the  construction  sector  and  their  exposure to it.\n\nLikewise, Saint-Gobain UK and Ireland supports Barnardo's YouthBuild  Academy,  which  aims  to  train  unemployed young people in the building trades at a time when the construction industry is facing labor shortages.\n\nEfforts are being made in South Africa to overcome the shortage  of  skills  in  ceiling  and  partition  installation through  the  'Saint-Gobain  YouthBuild  Academy'.  This training program,  launched  in  2003  and  financially supported since 2016 by YouthBuild International, aims to share the know-how of Group employees with unemployed  youth  from  disadvantaged  communities, through  a  combination  of  theoretical  courses  and  the achievement of a local renovation project. The 'Saint-Gobain  YouthBuild  Academy'  is  the  only  CETA (Construction  Education  Training  Authority)  accredited training  provider  with  accreditation  to  facilitate  the National Certificate: Ceiling & Partition Installation NQF. The Group sustainably supports youth employment while contributing  to  the  dynamism  of  its  sector  of  activity. Since its creation, about 1,000/uni00A0people have benefited from this program.\n\nIn November 2021, Saint-Gobain in Morocco developed its own academy with the same objective of training young people  in  the  building  trades  and  in  particular  in  the evolution of techniques related to sustainable construction. Qualifying training courses are provided in three training centers. The objective of the academy in Morocco  is  to  train  3,000  professionals  by  the  end  of 2022.\n\nIn  France,  Saint-Gobain  inaugurated  an  apprenticeship training center (CFA) in 2020. Two channels have been developed: industrial maintenance and sales and marketing.\n\nFinally, in India, the Saint-Gobain  India  Foundation supports  more  than  9,500  young  girls  in  targeted education programs.\n\n3",

Purchasing meets  the  needs  of  the  Group's  manufacturing  and distribution activities. Although the Purchasing functions are  based  on  shared  policies  and  a  common  base, specifically the implementation of the Responsible Purchasing policy (see this chapter, section/uni00A01.4), they do not operate at the same level of the Saint-Gobain value chain:\n\n- non-trade purchases: these relate to purchases /uni25A0 upstream  of  the  production  stage  (raw  materials, energy,  chemicals,  components,  etc.),  purchases  of equipment  used  for  production  (machinery,  civil engineering,  etc.),  all  logistics  expenses,  as  well  as purchases of support functions (IT, marketing, human resources, EHS, communication, finance, audit, etc.);\n- trade purchases: purchasing downstream  of  the /uni25A0 production  to  ensure  the  offerings  of  the  Group's distribution brands.\n\nSaint-Gobain's purchasing policy favors the establishment of medium- and long-term contracts and partnerships with its suppliers. In the context of the coronavirus crisis, the Group's buyers acted responsibly: the payment terms of suppliers such as VSEs and SMEs were not modified.\n\nThe Group has endeavored to develop the professionalism of its buyers through training activities. A training path is open  to  all  Group's  buyers  within  the  scope  of  the Purchasing School. More specific training courses intended for trade buyers complete this program. These training courses, which are particularly important for newcomers in the Purchasing Department, provide them with tools that enable  them,  and  their  teams,  to  achieve  behavioral excellence in their daily activities.\n\nBeyond the specific features connected with its activities, Saint-Gobain  recognizes  the  major  role  the  Purchasing Department  plays  in  competitiveness,  innovation  and sustainable performance. Buyers are especially committed to the 2030 CO2 roadmap, both for the control and the reduction of scope/uni00A03 emissions and for the development of renewable or carbon-free energy purchases.\n\nThe supply chain of industrial sites is mostly local. Less than  5%  of  a  region's  puchases  are  made  outside  its\n\ngeograpical area. This implies the management of a large number of suppliers. More than 210,000 companies supply the sites, of which more than 15,000 account for 80% of the Group  purchases.  Trading  purchases  are  more concentrated around more than 12,000 suppliers.\n\n## Logistics optimization 3.2.2\n\nRepresenting/uni00A0for  more  than  a  third  of  its  scope/uni00A03  CO2 emissions, optimizing logistics both upstream and downstream of the value chain, is a key factor in reducing Saint-Gobain's carbon impact and achieving the target of a 16% reduction in scope/uni00A03 emissions by 2030.\n\nThe Group has develop \"Industry 4.0\" and \"Supply/uni00A0Chain/uni00A04.0\" digital programs to optimize transportations. Whether for purchases or for customer deliveries, the majority of transport is by road.\n\nThe use of digital technology through data collection is at the  heart  of  Saint-Gobain's  'Industry  4.0'  and  'Supply Chain 4.0' programs. The information technologies used enable optimum vehicle loading and more efficient journey planning by coordinating incoming and outgoing transport to avoid empty kilometers.\n\nThus, the Group uses supply chain modeling, optimization and simulation software to find the best balance between delivery  times,  costs,  inventories  and  carbon  footprint. A/uni00A0dedicated  skills  center  has  been  set  up  to  develop practices  and  facilitate  collaboration  between  sites  and activities.\n\n- In partnership with logistics service providers, Saint-Gobain favors the use of vehicles that comply with EURO/uni00A0V and/uni00A0VI emission  standards,  or  promotes  the transition to less emitting fuels for the fleet. The Optimera Distribution  entity  in  Norway  has  pioneered  the  use  of biodiesel fuel for its trucks.\n\nSaint-Gobain is committed to using transport modes in an agile way, switching to less polluting multimodal transport modes such as rail and river or sea transport whenever possible.\n\nNumerous actions have been taken, such as the initiatives of  Point.P  in  France  to  develop  river  transport  in  the region of Paris. For example, the Quai de Javel branch in Paris receives deliveries by barge, thus avoiding the use of trucks.\n\n3",

It is based on performance improvement methods such as Lean, Six Sigma, TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) or 5S. This program defines the logic, the objective of rigor and the actions to achieve continuous improvements in terms of performance and sustainability.\n\nThe WCM program ensures strict compliance with internal standards such as the OPEN program, the 'Saint-Gobain Attitudes' concerning the development of people, and the risk prevention framework.\n\nIt is based on certification procedures such as ISO/uni00A09001 for quality, ISO/uni00A014001 and 50001 for the environment, OHSAS/uni00A018001, ILO OSH/uni00A02001 and ISO/uni00A045001 for health and safety.\n\n## Governance of the program and 3.3.1.1 its deployment\n\nThe management of the program, the monitoring of its execution and the improvement of the performance of the sites are managed in a transversal and independent manner, in coordination with the industrial departments. The governance of the program was defined with the objective of enabling an intelligent and pragmatic implementation, in the service of the efficiency of the operations and customer satisfaction.\n\nThe deployment of the WCM program at a site is adapted to its priorities, size, strengths and weaknesses - as identified by an internal analysis by comparing it with other sites in the same business line - and its objectives in terms of financial and environmental performance, quality and customer satisfaction. Thus, each site establishes its own roadmap, in accordance with international guidelines, standards specific to its business, the expectations of its customers and the improvement objectives set. Each industrial department and each business is responsible for defining, leading and monitoring the results of the sites within its scope. A WCM network of expertise has been set up to enable better dissemination of the WCM program, the optimization of resources by country, region or business line, as well as the sharing of expertise on each of the program pillars. A central team heads up the WCM network, trains the teams, creates and applies the program standards, circulates the tools and provides site-specific assistance on request.\n\n## The Saint-Gobain WCM model and its tools 3.3.1.2\n\nSaint-Gobain's WCM program is based on eight pillars, each one representing an area of excellence:\n\n## The pillars of the WCM program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe foundations of the program define the methods and tools:\n\n- analyzing losses to determine a priorization of actions; /uni25A0\n- resolving problems with logic, rigor and precision for /uni25A0 lasting improvement;\n- involving and engaging employees in a proactive /uni25A0 approach;\n- improving standards to make progress easier to deploy /uni25A0 and more robust over time.\n\nAchieving industrial excellence is a demanding process that requires gradual, methodical and constant implementation. The benefits in terms of competitiveness, improvement of customer service, stability of performance and employee commitment can be measured at each stage of the site path. Requirement levels have been used to determine the principles shared by the whole organization, and also tailored to the diverse range of the Group's industrial sites: sizes, businesses or local context. Each of these requirement levels matches both a performance objective set by the business and a maturity milestone in the program. In addition to dashboards that measure performance improvement, WCM audits check the robustness of the actions implemented and the durability of the results obtained. These audits resulted in more than 174 'Bronze' level and 43 'Silver' level certifications. Two of these sites achieved the 'Gold' level for the first time in Saint-Gobain's history.",

The  'Quality', 'Industrial performance' and 'Environment' pillars contribute significantly to reducing Saint-Gobain's environmental footprint by reducing production waste and water consumption and by improving energy efficiency. The WCM program and its extension to the supply chain represent a change of culture and management system, with  the  aim  of  bringing  a  high  level  of  service  to customers, better competitiveness and greater efficiency, while continuously improving the health and safety of all Group employees and those of its partners. It fosters and promotes employee engagement and mobility. Finally, it contributes to the success of the digital transformation of factories and to the adoption of its methods and tools by users (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.3.1.2).\n\nThe methods developed in the 'people development' pillar make it possible to manage Saint-Gobain's technical skills by adapting training programs (see this chapter, section/uni00A04.3.5),  employee  career  paths  and,  if  necessary, the search for external skills.\n\n## Managing industrial and distribution risks 3.3.1.4\n\nThe aim of the industrial and distribution risk prevention policy  is  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  accidental  events occurring, to minimize their severity if they do occur, and finally to preserve the continuity of business operations. This policy applies to all Saint-Gobain sites.\n\nDefined and led by the Risk and Insurance Department, this policy is rolled out within the organization to the sites by a network of prevention coordinators. A risk prevention manual is the Group's reference base and is available in some  fifteen languages. It includes the applicable standards,  procedures  and  technical  rules,  methods  for identifying and reducing risks, including natural risks, and the drafting of emergency and business continuity plans. This manual may be shared with the relevant stakeholders, such  as  permanent  on-site  subcontractors.  The  risk assessment  tool  is  used  by  all  operational  sites  and provides an objective assessment of the protection and prevention level. It takes into account both human factors (organization, procedures, communication, training, etc.) and physical facilities. This means that each site is able to identify its areas for improvement, develop action plans including  investments,  and  use  the  tool  to  measure progress.\n\nThe Group is rolling out business continuity plans for each site according to the risk evaluation and the vulnerability of  processes  to  unforeseen  interruptions  including  an anticipation of the impacts of an accident so as to limit its effects. The aim is to fully or partially ensure customer service and recover operational capacities as quickly as possible.  The  subcontractors  working  on  the  sites  are\n\ninvolved in the process and must commit to a prevention plan.\n\nIn 2021,  Saint-Gobain  continued  to  develop  its  risk management system in order to better understand, assess and if necessary, implement action plans to anticipate and reduce  the  impact  of  risks  reated  to  natural  disasters, which are becoming more frequent and severe. it should be noted that this system also allows for the integration of scenarios linked to climate change.\n\n## Management of environmental, 3.3.1.5 health and safety risks\n\nThe EHS standard is applicable to all Saint-Gobain sites. It specifies  the  Environment,  industrial  Health  and  Safety (EHS) management system that needs to be put in place and  explains  the  risk  identification  and  management method  for  environmental  and  health  and  safety  risks posed  to  employees  and  on-site  subcontractors.  It  is coordinated with the ISO/uni00A014001 and ISO/uni00A045001 requirements. Whether it is certified or not, each site of the Group carries out its own mapping of environmental, health and safety risks.\n\nTo support the EHS and ISO certification drive, the health and  safety  risk  assessment  is  subject  to  a  specific standard, that is circulated and updated by Saint-Gobain's EHS Department. All sites must comply with this standard. In 2021, a guide was created to present the requirements and  recommendations  on  risk  management  during  a construction  project. All standards  and  guides  are accompanied by training materials for local organizations in charge of training. The environmental risk assessment standard was updated in 2020, and training sessions were organized to help with its implementation. Based on the ISO/uni00A014001 approach and reference, this standard allows for the standardization of the approach across all sites and guidance of the people in charge of the assessments to define  the  most  relevant  actions  to  ensure  continuous improvement.\n\nThere is a digital version of the EHS risk assessment that includes  the  analysis,  assessment  and  risk  management measures. This tool enables the rollout, reliable implementation and monitoring of action plans across all Group sites.\n\nIn addition to the EHS framework, the EHS risk matrix is included  in  the  internal  control  framework.  Audits  on compliance of the EHS management system, conducted by  the  EHS  Department,  and  external  certification measures complete the control system. The pilot version of the  internal  EHS  audit  (ISA:  Integrated  System Assessment) has been finalized and focused on certified sites. In addition, a version of the audit methodology has been developed for smaller sites for which ISO certification is less suitable. When an acquisition is made, the process of integrating the new entity into the Group includes a specific procedure for EHS policy implementation.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "Achieve excellence in operations\n\nLastly, the EHS training matrix, which defines the training to be provided based on the job held, is a particularly relevant tool to define employees' EHS training paths.\n\nIn addition to its EHS policy, Saint-Gobain has rolled out specific  policies  to  control  health  risks,  manage  water, energy and air emissions, sustainably manage resources and biodiversity, and monitor the other eight standards related  to  safety  risks  (management  of  subcontractors, working at heights, lock-out and tag-out, machine safety, forklifts, vehicles and pedestrians, loading and unloading, road risks).\n\nAn annual report on environmental and health and safety performance  is  verified  by  an  independent  third-party organization. It is published in chapter/uni00A04, page/uni00A02.2.\n\n## Environmental protection 3.3.2\n\nSaint-Gobain is committed to protecting the environment. This means meeting the expectations of stakeholders in this area and offering its customers the greatest possible added  value  with  the  lowest  possible  environmental impact. The Group has set itself two long-term targets: not have  any  environmental  accidents  and  minimize  the impact of its activities on the environment.\n\nThese objectives are conveyed by means of short- and medium-term  objectives  that  concern  the  five  main environmental  challenges  identified by Saint-Gobain: resources;  energy,  atmospheric  emissions  and  climate; water;  biodiversity  and  the  use  of  soil;  environmental accidents and pollution.\n\n## Energy and air emissions 3.3.2.1\n\nSaint-Gobain's policy on 'Energy, atmospheric emissions and climate change' aims to reduce its energy consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  whether through its industrial processes, infrastructure or logistics, on  all  sites.  To  coordinate  measures  to  reduce  energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (scopes/uni00A01 and 2) energy and climate managers have been appointed for the most energy-intensive industrial processes. They are tasked with analyzing performance gaps relative to the best performers and with sharing good practices to be replicated across all sites.\n\nEach site must set the progress targets and monitoring procedures for managing  energy  and  atmospheric emissions, taking into account comparisons on processes between the different sites. All of these actions are part of the  CO2  roadmap,  established  to  track  the  Group's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nDirect CO2 emissions of Saint-Gobain (scope/uni00A01) are mainly related  to  its  industrial  activities.  These  CO2  emissions result from the combustion of fossil fuels and chemical reactions used in the manufacturing processes (e.g. the decarbonization of carbonates in the glass fusion processes). The Group's indirect CO2 emissions (scope/uni00A02) are  essentially  connected  with  its  electricity  purchases. The use of recycled raw materials in industrial processes makes  it possible to reduce energy consumption, particularly  for  glass  melting.  In  the  case  of  flat  glass, energy  consumption  is  reduced  by  3%  when  the percentage of cullet is increased from 20% to 30% of raw materials. This reduction  in  energy  consumption  is accompanied by a reduction in CO2 emissions (scope/uni00A01). The  actions  taken  for  the  transition  to  the  circular economy  therefore also have positive effects on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nEnergy  efficiency  is  also  an  essential  factor  in  the environmental and financial performance of Saint-Gobain's sites which also enables the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Group is encouraging energy audits on its sites and is setting up a system for energy management drawing on ISO/uni00A050001 certification. At the end of 2021, 91/uni00A0sites in the scope concerned were ISO/uni00A050001 certified, representing/uni00A035% of Saint-Gobain's annual energy consumption. In addition, a procedure of energy audits was initiated, with the aim of improving the insulation of the Group's production facilities.\n\nSaint-Gobain places all its sites in a phase of continuous improvement.  In  this  respect,  they  aim  to  identify  and evaluate  the  Best  Techniques  and  Practices  Available (MTD)  and  then  progressively  upgrade  them  at  an economically  acceptable  cost,  in  accordance  with  the Group's environmental vision. An MTD deployment plan is defined, updated annually and included in the three-year strategic plan. The actions implemented include optimizing  energy  use  in  response  to  needs  (usage  to power engines, lighting or the use of compressed gas) and the recovery of energy from manufacturing processes.\n\n## The carbon impact of energy\n\nMore than three-quarters of Saint-Gobain's total energy consumption is directly linked to purchases of fossil fuels. The  ability  of  industrial  processes  to  move  from  using fossil  fuels  to  low-carbon  energy  solutions  -  electricity (when it is low-carbon), biogas, or even hydrogen - is therefore  crucial.  Action  plans  have  been  drawn  up between the non-trade purchasing teams in the countries, the  industrial  departments  and  the  local  environmental managers, in order to identify regular and reliable sources of  renewable  energy.  The  Group  is  also  developing projects  on  its  sites  using  new  energies  (wind  energy, biomass, biogas, solar energy, etc.). These developments may be made in association with external partners.\n\n## Limiting emissions into the air other than greenhouse gases\n\nSaint-Gobain  actively  manages  its  non-greenhouse  gas atmospheric emissions. Environmental managers coordinate this process. When the primary measures are not sufficiently effective, dust emissions are controlled by investments  in  electrostatic  precipitators  or  bag  filters, depending  on  the  type  of  industrial facility. This equipment also makes it possible to filter the heavy metals resulting from impurities contained in certain raw materials.  Some  of  the  Group's  plants,  mainly  glass furnaces and pipeline production sites, emit substances that contribute to the acidification of environments such as  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  or  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx).  The primary  measures  introduced  to  reduce  sulfur  dioxide emissions  include  the  reduction  in  energy  consumption and the use of fuels with a low sulfur content. Primary measures to optimize processes, particularly combustion, make it possible to reduce NOx emissions at source. In addition  to  these  primary  measures,  equipment  for  the secondary treatment of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides is also installed.\n\nSome  industrial  sites  are  affected  by  Volatile  Organic Compound (VOC) emissions as a result of their industrial process. On-site monitoring is based on measurements as needed. The aim is to check that emissions are below the limits set by the environmental operation permit; as such, it is heavily dependent on the local context. Optimization of raw  materials  can  reduce  VOC  emissions,  while secondary measures through a decontamination unit are implemented when necessary.",

        "page_content": "## Water management 3.3.2.2\n\nSaint-Gobain's Water policy ('Water policy') confirms the desire to reduce the impacts of the Group's activities on water resources as much as possible, whether in terms of water intake or discharge. The long-term objective is to withdraw as little water as possible and to aim for 'zero discharge'of industrial water in liquid form, while avoiding generating new impacts for other natural environments and/or for other stakeholders. To this end, Saint-Gobain does its utmost to:\n\n- reduce water withdrawals from the natural environment /uni25A0 and optimize processes to minimize water consumption;\n- reuse 'process' water whenever possible; /uni25A0\n- recycle on-site or off-site with appropriate treatments; /uni25A0\n- not degrade water quality by reducing and controlling /uni25A0 discharges into the natural environment and preventing any accidental pollution;\n- not  compete  with  local  populations  for  access  to /uni25A0 drinking water.\n\nTo assess the water sensitivity of its sites, the Group uses the global 'Aqueduct' atlas of the WRI organization. This atlas  is  based  not  only  on  qualitative  and  quantitative physical risks (such as water stress or flood risk), but also on stakeholder risk (like access to water). This tool enables each industrial site to assess its water risk from 'low' to 'extremely high'. In 2021,/uni00A0199 sites representing approximately/uni00A016% of water withdrawals and/uni00A09% of Saint-Gobain discharge were located in high or extremely high risk areas.\n\nThe  'Focus  Site'  program  consists  of  supporting  sites which  contribute  to  80%  of  the  Group's  environmental indicator. In 2021, 43/uni00A0sites representing 80% of Saint-Gobain's water  discharges  drew  up  a  short-, medium-  and  long-term  action  plans  to  reduce  their impact. The Group's commitment to water preservation has led it to participate, since 2012, in the CDP Water Disclosure, which aims to encourage businesses to report in detail on the risks and opportunities concerning water management and to report results transparently. In 2021, Saint-Gobain obtained an A- rating.\n\n## Resource management 3.3.2.3\n\nSaint-Gobain has the long-term ambition of not producing any non-recovered production waste and of maximizing the recycled content of its products. The Group believes that waste should be considered as a strategic resource and that recycled or bio-sourced materials should be used whenever possible as a substitute for non-renewable virgin resources.  The  policy  of  sustainable  management  of resources aims to promote the responsible management of  resources  in  order  to  promote  the  transition  to  the circular economy. First and foremost, the good performance of a site can thus be defined as the most effective  way  to  optimize  the  resources  used.  This performance  is  also  reflected  in  the  reduction  of  the impact attributable to the use of resources throughout the life cycle of products and services.\n\nThe main focuses for the deployment of this policy are incorporating  as  much  reused,  recycled  or  bio-sourced content into its products as possible, generating as little production waste as possible, and recovering waste from its processes internally or externally.\n\nIn line with the Group's Health policy and in compliance with  local  regulations,  the  management  of  hazardous waste  is  closely  monitored  to  protect  the  health  of employees, residents, customers and users of its products and services. By encouraging cross-functional actions and synergies between its various industrial and distribution business  lines,  the  Group  is  committed  to  providing innovative solutions and seizing opportunities related to the challenges of respectful management of materials, and of the efficient processing and transformation of waste. The specific action plans to promote the circular economy are described in this chapter.\n\n## Incorporate maximum reused, recycled or bio-sourced content into products\n\nSome  of  Saint-Gobain's  products  can  be  recycled indefinitely  in  a  closed  loop  in  their  industrial  process, which is then adapted to the replacement of natural raw materials with recycled materials from either internal or external  collection. Therefore,  their  inclusion  in  the products essentially depends on the existence of efficient, long-term collection networks.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "## An efficient and responsible Group\n\nAchieve excellence in operations\n\nToday,/uni00A015 countries  throughout  the  world  use  plaster waste from worksites to manufacture their plasterboard. Over/uni00A0292,000 tons of waste plasterboard from sites were recovered  and  recycled  in  this  way  worldwide  in  2021, representing the equivalent of the annual output of two medium-sized  factories. Weber,  which  manufactures industrial  mortars,  has  rolled  out  an  ambitious  global action plan to gradually reduce dependence on sand and portland  cement.  Initiatives  are  being  developed  in  all regions of the world to seek more sustainable substitutes, such as the use of used foundry sand, the use of slag, or the use of waste tires. These initiatives sometimes help to develop industrial synergies within the Group.\n\nLogistics  have  been  optimized  for  glass  products  to promote the recovery of cullet (glass debris) across the entire  value  chain  where  Saint-Gobain  is  present  and especially between glass processing sites (manufacturing of  windshields  or  windows,  for  example)  and  glass furnaces. Other Group products can already tolerate the replacement  of  virgin raw  materials with recycled materials from other consumption circuits, such as glass wool and cast iron pipe. For many years, glass wool has included cullet in its composition. In 2021, external cullet accounted for over/uni00A057% of all materials loaded into the furnaces (and more than/uni00A080% in countries such as Japan, South  Korea  or  Argentina).  Similarly,  the  production  of cast  iron  pipes  and  other  piping  elements  (connectors, manholes) uses a 'second fusion' process which is carried out by fusing scrap and recovery cast iron. The annual quantities depend on their availability on the market.\n\nThe  approach  applied  to  products  also  applies  to  the packaging that accompanies them. Action plans are rolled out at the central level and relayed to the national level to increase  the  recyclability  and  recycled  content  of  the packaging  used.  Initiatives  are  underway  in  Brazil  to replace  the  dual-material  bags  (paper/plastic)  used  for mortars and coated with all-paper bags, with an internal treatment to protect the product from humidity.\n\n## Generate minimum production waste and recycle it internally\n\nThe industrial sites are working to reduce the quantities of waste  generated  in  accordance  with  the  three  Rs hierarchy:  Reduce,  Reuse  and  Recycle.  Incineration  and landfilling should be limited as much as possible.\n\nThe priority waste management actions initially relate to a reduction in the quantities of production waste generated. Operational excellence carried out in the WCM program (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.3.1.2), particularly in terms of quality and productivity, is the first approach to reduce waste and optimize the use of resources. The sites then seek  to  reuse  production  waste  in  their  own  industrial process:\n\n- in  India,  the  Perundurai  plant,  which  manufactures /uni25A0 refractory  blocks,  obtained  an  'Emeraude'  award  in 2021 for the project carried out on its foundry sand\n\n- residues,  enabling  the  annual  prevention  of  nearly 10,000 tons of waste initially intended for landfill and reducing the need for new sand by more than 1,000 tons,  by  modifying  its  production  processes  and developing external channels;\n- in Egypt, the Sadat plaster plant, which had more than /uni25A0 12,000  tons  of  waste  sent  to  landfill  each  year, succeeded in recycling all of its industrial waste in 2019, thereby improving its 'material yield'. This performance was  achieved  by  examining  all  the  stages  of  the process,  by  considering  all  production  waste,  by reducing  them  step  by  step,  by  improving  the efficiency of the process, by favoring internal recycling solutions,  and  by  researching  the  most  appropriate external recycling sectors when internal recycling was not possible;\n- a glass plant in China has initiated a new process to /uni25A0 recycle fine dust from processing by the electrofiltration of its smoke. Inspired by the pharmaceutical industry, it makes it possible to adjust the  glass  composition  according  to  the  amount  and chemical  analysis  of  the  dust  put  back  into  the furnaces. This process brings about a reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill and optimizes glass compositions;\n- in Japan, a glass wool plant has developed a process to /uni25A0 recycle  100%  of  production  waste  in  a  closed  loop, paving the way for other glass wool furnaces in the world;\n- lastly,  a  disruptive  technology  has  been  in  place  for /uni25A0 several  years  at  a  stone  wool  production  site  in Romania,  enabling  all  of  its  production  waste  to  be recycled in the industrial process.\n\n## External recovery of waste from its processes\n\nEven for industrial processes favorable to the incorporation  of  recycled  materials,  optimizations  are possible. Saint-Gobain's plasterboard manufacturing plant in Vietnam has introduced a process to separate the paper from the plasterboard during a waste reprocessing phase. The plaster is reincorporated into the process when the paper is recycled in the manufacture of cardboard via an external  recovery  network.  Production  waste  generated during  the  production  of  bitumen  membranes  in  the United States are recovered externally for use in addition to bitumen in road construction or renovation.\n\nSome of the waste generated during the production of mineral  wools  is  reprocessed  before  being  recovered externally  as  a  secondary  raw  material  for  the  roofing industry  or  for  certain  manufacturers  that  manufacture acoustic ceilings. The Group is also involved in the creation of  recycling  networks  with  the  help  of  external  local partners.  Progress  in  the  reduction  and  recycling  of production waste made at certain Group sites shows that 'zero non-recovered waste' is an achievable ambition.",

Thanks to the experience acquired in the field of extraction activities, the Group now has strong internal expertise in the area; it has adopted a biodiversity policy, the aim of which is to preserve, restore, enhance  and  boost  biodiversity,  and  to  this  end  to encourage the involvement of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nA mapping study of all Saint-Gobain's sites was conducted using geographical tools to evaluate their sensitivity to the ecosystems  based  on  their  proximity  to  areas  of  high biodiversity  value.  The  protected  areas  considered  are areas  recognized  by  the  International  Union  for  the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) or more locally defined as Natura 2000 or RAMSAR areas. In 2019, the study was continued, adding as criteria the environmental impact of the sites, the expectations of stakeholders and the actions already undertaken in terms of biodiversity. This made it possible to finalize a list of around one hundred priority sites in 2021, the vast majority of which were quarries, for the implementation of biodiversity management plans and the sharing of best practices.\n\nOut of the 141 underground or surface quarries operated by  the  Group  worldwide,  the  vast  majority  are  for  the\n\nAchieve excellence in operations\n\nproduction  of  gypsum  (101  or  72%).  A  charter  for  the environment and biodiversity in all Saint-Gobain's quarries and  mines  was  published  in  2019,  capitalizing  on  the experience  acquired  over  many  years  in  gypsum.  The Group's quarries are operated and then restored with the aim of preserving the environment in accordance with the local rules. During the operating and restoration period, the  effects  on  residents  and  on  the  environment  are reduced as much as possible: visual impact, dust, noise and vibration, consequences to road traffic and repercussions on the local natural environments. In 2021, 39% of Saint-Gobain priority sites, around two-thirds of which  quarries  in  operation,  already  had  a  biodiversity management plan analyzed centrally. 'Biodiversity representatives'  have  been  appointed  at  each  of  the priority sites. A training module explaining the challenges of  biodiversity  and  the  successful  implementation  of  a biodiversity management plan was rolled out, and around twenty  best  practices  in  terms  of  biodiversity  were distributed internally.\n\nAmong the local initiatives identified in 2021, the Group renewed its commitment to 'Act4nature International', a voluntary commitment to biodiversity from international companies: one of the strong commitments concerns the implementation of biodiversity management plans for all active open-cast quarries by 2025.\n\n3",

The innovation approach,  made  up  of  iterations,  creativity,  agility  and openness to the outside world (university, partners, etc.), puts the customer at the heart of the project from the identification of needs to the validation of prototypes.\n\nThe methods used concern local projects and international projects  ( via pilot  countries).  The  marketing  teams  are involved  in  the  characterization  of  needs  (functional analysis)  and  formalize  functional  specifications.  These specification are the foundations for the development of the innovation that will be taken up by the R&D teams. Customers  are  also involved in the validation of industrialized solutions before their launch.\n\nSaint-Gobain has a procedure for monitoring innovation applied to products, which is initiated by the R&D and marketing  teams.  The  tool  is  a  sequenced  operational roadmap for the development teams, where every step in the innovation process is reviewed by a committee set up for this purpose.  This  methodology  allows  for  the identification of and  prompt  attention  to  potential problems. Close monitoring of the progress achieved and product performance means that the process of innovation is faster and more secure.\n\nThe EHS checklist, introduced in 2008, is integrated into the innovation process. It enables a qualitative assessment of the substances included in product formulations and identification and reduction of environmental and health and safety impacts throughout the product life cycle. With regard to hazardous substances, the aim is to prevent the use of new hazardous substances and reduce their use in raw  materials  while  reducing  and  controlling  exposure levels. The innovation process incorporates normative and regulatory  requirements,  from  the  functional  marketing specifications stage. Local marketing teams ensure that products  comply  with  the  legislation  and  standards applicable in the countries of commercialization.\n\nThe  process  for  launching  new  products,  systems  and services  is  checked  within  the  framework  of  Internal Control (see chapter/uni00A06, section/uni00A02.5). It is regularly updated to improve the quality management system procedures and associated monitoring indicators. Technical products are  launched  after  sales  force  training  and  reinforced support by product managers and technical trainers. In several countries, they intervene directly on the worksites when installers use a differentiating innovation for the first time,  throughout  the  launch  phases  until  the  sales organization  reaches  a  sufficient  level  of  maturity.  The marketing  and  sales  community,  which  brings  together teams  in  different  countries  and  activities,  shares  best pratices and facilitates the integration of newly acquired brands.\n\nSaint-Gobain  University's  UniCampus  program  (see  this chapter, section 4.3.5) offers five training courses related to the innovation process. 191 people were trained in 2021, despite  the  health  context.  These  training  courses  are intended  primarily  for  the  R&D  and  the  marketing functions of local activities. A product compliance training module  has  also  been  integrated  into  the  program.\n\nConcrete courses combining theory, practice and experience  sharing  are  offered  widely  to  the  main functions  involved  in  the  innovation  process,  such  as marketing,  R&D,  purchasing,  production  and  industrial efficiency. A new training course has been launched in 2021, Deriksing a key success factor for your innovations , whose objective is to greatly increase the success and impact of innovations while reducing lead times by relying on  better  anticipation.  Built  arount  the  Business  Model Canvas, it helps identify all types of risks and conditions for the success of innovation projects at each stage of development, including launch.\n\nFinally, the World Class Manufacturing (WCM) industrial excellence  program  (see  this  chapter,  section/uni00A03.3.1.2) ensures  the  deployment  of  best  practices  in  terms  of quality and product compliance at industrial sites, based on the ISO/uni00A09001/uni00A0standard.\n\nAt European level, the Group contributes to the work of the  European  Committee  for  Standardization  (CEN)  in developing standards and regulatory systems. Likewise, its active participation in European interprofessional associations  such  as  EURIMA,  Eurogypsum,  Glass  for Europe and EMO provides input into the Group's vision of standards development in Europe, in particular through exchanges  with  the  European  Commission  and  its institutions  such  as  the  European  Chemical  Agency (ECHA) in charge of the REACH regulation.\n\nWith  regard  to  consumer  information,  the  Group's products  comply  with  current  regulations,  such  as  CE marking  in  Europe  or  the  requirement  for  chemical products  to  have  labels  and  safety  data  sheets  (SDS). Saint-Gobain  also  provides  non-mandatory  information specific to some of its products, such as:\n\n- voluntary safety data declaration sheets for unclassified /uni25A0 articles or substances;\n- the declaration of the composition of components and /uni25A0 materials via the IMDS database (International Material Data System) in the case of the automotive industry;\n- specific  labels  such  as  the  environmental  and  health /uni25A0 data sheet for construction products in France;\n- voluntary certifications obtained through independent /uni25A0 national  laboratories  -  or,  failing  that,  international laboratories close to these markets - when innovative products or systems are not covered by international or national standards.\n\nAs product compliance is a constantly evolving process, Saint-Gobain has complemented the measures already in place in 2021 with a program to strenghten the culture of product quality and compliance. The program is designed to remind countries and local teams of the key principles and processes related to product quality and compliance throughout  the  product  life  cycle,  from  design  to production, use and finally end of life.\n\nThis program includes 4 steps:\n\n- awareness campaigns at all Group levels; /uni25A0\n- definition of a roadmap by local management teams; /uni25A0\n- evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  measures  in  the /uni25A0 countries for each activity;\n- definition and implementation of sustainable /uni25A0 improvement plans if necessary.",

        "page_content": "A network of local facilitators has been set up to support the teams in the countries or activities during deployment and  to  ensure  the  sharing  of  best  practices,  thus promoting  the  continuous  improvement  of  procedures. The progress of the program's implementation is monitored by a committee created for this purpose and bringing together members of the Executive Committee (see chapter 1, section 5.2.2).\n\n## Product transparency 3.4.2\n\nSaint-Gobain  has  been  involved  for  many  years  in  the promotion  of  Life  Cycle  Assessments  (LCA)  to  better understand and control the environmental impacts of its products. These analyzes are useful for guiding innovation, better informing customers and responding to a growing market demand for greater transparency. Saint-Gobain is committed to ensuring that, by 2030, 100% of the Group's revenue  generated  with  products  covered  by  verified LCAs  (Life  Cycle  Analyses),  or  EPDs  (Environmental Product Declarations), excluding distribution activity. By the end of 2021, 29.1% of revenues came from products covered by verified LCAs, or EPDs, excluding distribution activity.\n\nIn  2021,  Saint-Gobain's  industrial  activities  continued  to carry out life cycle analyses and publish EPDs verified by third parties. With nearly 1,500 verified EPDs published in over 33/uni00A0countries, the Group is the world's leading supplier of verified EPDs - by volume - in the construction sector.\n\nThrough the development of version 4 of the LEED label for  buildings  and  new  voluntary  product  certifications such  as  C2C  or  Declare,  the  demand  for  transparency about the substances contained in construction products is  growing  strongly.  This  trend  also  corresponds  to  an essential  need  for  the  development  of  the  circular economy.\n\nSaint-Gobain is keen to provide responses that are both appropriate and rigorous, and also consistent with existing regulations.\n\nDepending on the geographical area, the Group meets the expectations of its customers through various means such as content declarations (which list the substances present in a  product),  declarations  according  to  the  North American  voluntary  standard  HPD  (Health  Product Declaration) or the 'Declare' label. In 2021, around twenty new content declaration type documents, HPDs or Declare labels  were  published  for  plasterboard,  insulation  and glass products.\n\nIn addition, Saint-Gobain is involved in the development and improvement of standards in terms of transparency and circularity. For example, Saint-Gobain made a major contribution  to  the  new  version  of  the  C2C  standard (version 4) and to the development of the PCDS (Product Circularity  Data  Sheet)  initiative  led  by  Luxembourg. Lastly,  Saint-Gobain  continued  its  efforts  to  develop  a European version of the HPD standard mentioned above, consistent with the existing regulatory framework (REACH and CLP).\n\n## Customer satisfaction 3.4.3\n\nKnowledge of current and future market expectations is essential in order to achieve Saint-Gobain's medium- and long-term targets. For this reason, the satisfaction of its customers is a priority for the Group, whose objective is to be  an  organization  focused  on  their  expectations.  To measure  customer  satisfaction,  several  practices  have been extended to all Group activities:\n\n- firstly, a short questionnaire is sent to all clients and /uni25A0 potential clients, both direct and indirect, at the time of each interaction, in order to identify the main points of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and to determine the net promoter score, the only measure common to all; this refined measure will eventually make all clients the Group's primary influencers;\n- secondly, a more rigorous and responsive measurement /uni25A0 of compliance and punctuality (see this chapter, section 3.3.1), since these two parameters are the two most frequent sources of dissatisfaction in all the questionnaires: first and foremost, customers demand that their suppliers' promises be kept.\n\nThus, customer satisfaction measurements are carried out on a regular basis for all activities.\n\nIn the field, brands are increasingly collecting feedback from  customers  (defined  as  any  person  having  an influence on the purchasing decision) on a relationship and transactional level, with the dissemination, internally and across functions, of best practice in the area. This data is cross-referenced with the context of the relationship, as well as with the type of customers, in order to assess the degree of satisfaction throughout their journey, i.e . across the  entire  chain  of  interactions  between  them  and  the Group's brands. In this context, the satisfaction questionnaires  already  implemented  have  shown  that compliance and punctuality (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.3.1) are the most frequently cited negative points.\n\nOne of the Group's areas of excellence and progress is training,  in  order  to  build  a  growing  community  of customer experience experts. Each year, over 200 people are trained in customer experience methods and concepts through the UniCampus program. In addition, a platform called \"Pulse\" has been created to centralize and make available to Saint-Gobain countries and entities methodologies  and  tools  for  managing  the  customer experience, such as \"personas\", i.e. the definition of groups of  customers  whose  behaviors  and  preferences  are merged into a single predictive model.\n\nIn addition to the measurement of satisfaction itself, all of these  systems  create  the  basis  for  a  co-development approach;  on  the  basis  of  customer  opinions,  a  shared innovation process can be put in place.\n\n3",

The impacts of the solutions are assessed across the entire value chain and for the main stakeholders involved, right through to the end user.\n\nThe  critera  used  to  measure  the  benefits  related  to sustainable development focus on environmental impacts and those related to health and well-being. The measurement of the performance of solutions focuses on the  increase  in  economic  value  (productivity  or  other financial benefits) and the user experience.\n\nIn order to standardize the measurement of impacts and to accelerate differentiation in its markets, use cases have been  selected  to  illustrate the value provided  by Saint-Gobain solutions. They concern the decarbonization of industry through the solutions of the HPS, renovation and new construction Business Units. For each use case, local  teams  identify  solutions  combining  products  and services offerred by the brands and distribution networks. The tools developed enable them to measure the benefits and thus to adapt the offer and the sales pitch to the expectations of the stakeholders.\n\nThis program has covered more than 90% of Saint-Gobain's  sales  and  helps  to  orient  Saint-Gobain's offer towards  sustainable  construction  markets.  The methodology  used  to  identify  sustainable  solution  is available on the Group's website and has been reviewed by an independent third party.\n\nThe criteria used to measure environmental benefits are:\n\n- energy and carbon efficiency; /uni25A0\n- optimization  of  natural  resources,  including  water /uni25A0 resources;\n- all products and services that support the /uni25A0 environmental efficicency of other industries.\n\nThe  criteria  used  to  evaluate  the  benefits  in  terms  of health, comfort and well-being are:\n\n- safety and security, including the reduction of /uni25A0 occupational risks in the value chain;\n- ergonomics; /uni25A0\n- indoor air quality /uni25A0\n- acoustic comfort; /uni25A0\n- thermal comfort; /uni25A0\n- visual comfort. /uni25A0\n\nThe  proportion  of  sales  generated  with  sustainables solutions is 72% in 2020.\n\nSaint-Gobain's sustanaibles solutions sales include activities not assessed in the context of compliance with the European regulation 2020/852 Taxonomy regulation (see chapter 9, section 3.5) such as distribution activities, impacts and benefits not yet integrated into the regulation such  as  resources  and  the  circular  exonomy  or  finally benefits  related  to  health,  safety  and  comfort  that  will potentially be eligible for the social taxonomy.",

This policy requires a compulsory  buy-in  from  all employees for Saint-Gobain's values as expressed in its code  of  ethics,  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action. Saint-Gobain's  human  resources  policy  must  allow  for rapid  adaptation  of  the  organization  and,  in  particular, careful  management  of  changes  in  skills  requirements, support for employees in the face of major transformations,  as  well  as  attraction  and  retention  of talent.\n\nTo do this, it incorporates two dimensions:\n\n- global  coordination  tasked  with  defining  a  common /uni25A0 framework  for  all  Group  employees,  incorporating ethical values, respect for human rights, the deployment  of  managerial  principles  based  on  trust, accountability  and  collaboration,  and  the  offering  of training programs to better handle major cultural and market transformations, the establishment of ambitious and  demanding  health  and  safety  objectives,  social protection, diversity or any other subject that brings about decent working conditions for all;\n- local  implementation,  by  the  HR  teams  in  charge  of /uni25A0 Social Dialogue, wage policy, local adaptation and the implementation of action plans to achieve Saint-Gobain's objectives.\n\nIn addition to the HR operational performance indicators (see chapter/uni00A04, section/uni00A02.2), the success of this policy and the quality of Social Dialogue are measured each year in a survey conducted among all employees. The percentage of employees responding to the survey, their satisfaction with working conditions and their confidence in both the strategy  and  its  implementation  are  signs  of  a  strong commitment  that  vindicates  the  Group's  choice  of  a balance between local and global dimensions.\n\nThe  Human  Resources  Committee  meets  every  month under the chairmanship of the Executive Vice President in charge  of  Human  Resources  and  Corporate  Social Responsibility. It brings together the Directors of the HR support  functions,  in  particular  the  Director  of  Social Affairs and the Director of Group Talent and Executive Career  Management,  the  main  Directors  of  Human Resources  of  the  regions  and  the  Director  of  Human Resources of the HPS (High Performance Solutions) entity. Regular monitoring of local and global action plans and analysis of key HR indicators are carried out.\n\nEach  year,  Saint-Gobain  submits  its  human  resources practices to the Top Employers Institute, an independent\n\nbody that assesses human resources and ethics performance on the basis of an evaluation questionnaire followed by audits of practices. For the sixth consecutive year, the Group is one of the/uni00A011 companies to have gained global  recognition.  Saint-Gobain  is  also  recognized  Top Employer locally in/uni00A038 countries, corresponding to/uni00A092% of employees.\n\n## Managerial practices: 4.1.1 a global ambition\n\nOver  the  last  few  years,  Saint-Gobain  has  experienced profound  change,  including  the  shift  from  a  products offering  to  a  solutions  offering,  creating  a  spirit  of openness within Saint-Gobain: outward-looking openness to  be  attentive  to  the  world  around  it  and  provide responses to customers' needs and openness within the business, to foster dialogue and innovation.\n\nFive 'Saint-Gobain Attitudes' constitute both a management method and a shared mindset throughout the Group:\n\n- cultivate customer intimacy: understanding and /uni25A0 anticipating the needs of external and internal customers  and  responding  with  a  'solution-oriented' approach;\n- act  like  an  entrepreneur:  focus  on  performance  and /uni25A0 results, cultivating a certain openness to new ideas and an ability to adapt to change;\n- innovate: demonstrate curiosity but also promote and /uni25A0 value diversity to foster the generation of fresh ideas;\n- be agile: be proactive and anticipate change, including /uni25A0 change related to digital technology, while maintaining a focus on results;\n- build an open and engaging culture: exercise /uni25A0 considerate  leadership  in  a  volatile,  uncertain  and complex world.\n\nThe 'Saint-Gobain Attitudes' have been embedded in the Group's HR tools and procedures such as the managerial guidelines, annual  appraisals  and  360\u00b0  assessments, induction  programs  for  new  arrivals,  training,  especially management training, and talent management.\n\nIn  addition,  a  new  way  of  leadership  based  on  trust, accountability and  collaboration  is encouraged  and includes new ways of working together. To develop this mindset,  managers  have  training  programs,  tools  for implementing  new  collaborative  working  methods,  and inspiring examples to work on with their teams (see this chapter, section/uni00A04.3.5).\n\n3",

These results were obtained while the pandemic forced the rapid transition  to  remote  working  in  many  countries  and communication with teams via digital tools.\n\n## Local operational responsibility 4.1.2\n\nEach  country  implements  Saint-Gobain's  policies  and major  commitments  (health,  safety,  diversity,  etc.)  by adapting the action plans, stages of attainment and tools to the specific features and culture of its region without compromising  on  the  expected  performance  level.  HR policies are disseminated by the global HR network. The local teams have guides to support their deployment, and special training sessions  are  organized  by  the  HR Academy. Practical guides and practical training provided by the global support teams are available for the following topics in particular: Social Dialogue, diversity, compensation and benefits, talent management, recruitment and integration, and mobility.\n\n## Protecting the health and safety of employees 4.2\n\nThe health and safety of employees are absolute priorities, and  Saint-Gobain  makes  them  central  to  its  corporate culture. It is important for everyone to participate in their own health and safety, and those of all of their colleagues.\n\nThe  Group's  commitments  are  published  in  the  EHS Charter and the Health policy, available on the Saint-Gobain  website  and  which  state  the  following principles:\n\n- involvement  of  management  teams  in  support  of /uni25A0 employee engagement;\n- compliance with regulations and Saint-Gobain /uni25A0 standards;\n- exemplary behavior in processes, products and services /uni25A0 over the entire life cycle;\n- ongoing prevention and reduction of risks for /uni25A0 employees, temporary workers, subcontractors, visitors, customers and the environment;\n- collaboration and accountability of all through ongoing /uni25A0 dialogue with stakeholders.\n\nThis EHS  charter  is  accompanied  by  a  letter  of commitment from the Chief Executive Officer reminding everyone of the objectives of \"zero occupational accidents\" and \"zero occupational illnesses\", and of the principles. The management of health and safety risks is described in this chapter, section/uni00A04.2.\n\n## Employee health and well-being 4.2.1\n\nIn terms of health and well-being, Saint-Gobain adopted a policy in 2013 and updated it in early 2022. It sets out the guidelines for action to protect the health and promote the well-being of its employees, customers and suppliers, users of its products, as well as residents adjacent to its sites.\n\nThe Group's ambition is to protect health and promote well-being, maximizing its positive impact and minimizing the  footprint  of  its  activities  on  the  health  of  its employees, temporary workers and subcontractors who work  at  its  sites  around  the  world.  The  action  plan implementing this policy includes knowledge and tracking\n\nof the profile of exposure to occupational risks related to health and well-being as a fundamental element. Ergonomics,  workstation  design  and  adaptation  in  the event of limitations in the employee's ability to work are also central to the implementation of the policy. Finally, prevention  and  promotion  programs  for  health  and well-being  including  access  to  healthcare  and  social protection  for  employees  and  their  families  (see  this chapter, section 4.2.1) are deployed.\n\nAll Saint-Gobain's sites worldwide have to implement this policy, in accordance with their local regulations and in addition to the health and industrial hygiene guidelines, standards  and  tools  already  in  place.  The  actions implemented by each of the sites are prioritized following the completion of their health and well-being risk mapping in compliance with the EHS guidelines (see this chapter, section 3.3.1.5).\n\nTo ensure the same level of protection and medical care for all its employees worldwide, the Group has established mandatory  standards  and  recommendations  for  health and industrial hygiene. They are supplemented by specific standards  for  certain  activities  and  operating  kits.  The recommendations concerning the organization of first aid and the equipment of the entities with automatic external defibrillators were communicated.\n\n## The Covid-19 health crisis 4.2.1.1\n\nThe management of the Covid-19 pandemic relied on the networks of human resources, communication, EHS and medical teams, as well as an EHS management system deployed  in  all  countries  and  on  all  industrial  and distribution  sites.  Global  coordination  has  been  put  in place  to  monitor  the  epidemic,  with  these  networks working  in  close  collaboration  to  ensure  scientific  and regulatory monitoring, communicate on prevention measures and support and monitor deployment at all sites.\n\nAs of February/uni00A02020, central and local crisis units were set up,  bringing  together  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee,  extended  to  the  directors  of  the  major support functions, and in particular the Director of Medical and Occupational Health and the Director of Sustainable Development in charge of EHS.",

        "page_content": "To face this unprecedented health crisis, Saint-Gobain set itself two priorities:\n\n- protect employees, temporary workers and /uni25A0 subcontractors on site from health risks in accordance with  the  requirements  of  the  health  authorities,  by incorporating local cultural specificities and by being able,  depending  on  the  country,  to  apply  additional protection measures such as the use of remote working in advance of decisions by local authorities;\n- prevent the risks of psychological impact, particularly /uni25A0 those related to lockdown measures and the switch to working from home.\n\nThus, procedures were deployed by the Group, including individual  protection  measures  such  as  the  wearing  of masks, social distancing, temperature measurement and dianostic tests and on-site preventive measures such as cleaning procedures, ventilation systems, management of high-risk  situations  on  site  such  as  canteens  or  public transportation for commutes, working from home, isolation  and  monitoring  of  the  reporting  of  cases  by country.\n\nTo ensure prevention of psychological risks, the management teams used the Mental Well-Being tool (see this  chapter,  section/uni00A04.3.3)  and  guides  to  support  the implementation  of  working  from  home,  maintaining employee social bonds and motivation.\n\nFinally, general communications were set up directly on the  intranet  site  accessible  to  all  employees  to  give updates on the pandemic, general scientific information, prevention measures, videos and online training to help managers  manage  the  crisis,  and  regular  updates  on Saint-Gobain's  situation.  Health  alerts  specific  to  the implementation  of  internal  measures  such  as  travel restrictions  starting  January/uni00A02020  and  news  \"flashes\" informing employees of the situation were issued on a regular basis at a frequency appropriate to the management of the crisis.\n\n## A health risk management indicator 4.2.1.2\n\nIn  parallel  with  the  indicators  monitoring  safety  (total recordable accident rate, or TRAR) and the environment (EvE), Saint-Gobain has defined an indicator to control the risk to the health of its employees connected with their activities,  in  keeping  with  its  health  standards,  initially targeting  noise  risks.  This  indicator  will  also  take  into account risks related to chemical agents from 2022. This health indicator (HICE, Health Indicator for Occupational Exposure) is applied to all sites affected by exposure to noise and/or chemical agents. It corresponds to the rate of significant potential exposure to these health hazards and aims to promote the prioritization of actions to reduce the risks of exposure to employees on the sites.\n\nThe 'HICE Noise' indicator was rolled out in 2021. It is communicated  twice  a  year  to  the  Group's  Executive Committee. At the end of 2021, it stands at a level of 17.5 which means that, on average, on each site,/uni00A017.5% of the work situations of employees and permanent subcontractors are subject to potential noise exposure.\n\nSince December/uni00A02021, each  country  or  entity  EHS coordinator has also been asked to validate the quality of the chemical product inventories and the risk assessments reported in SAFHEAR by the sites in their scope. This will make it possible to calculate from 2022 a 'HICE Chemical Agents'  indicator to help the sites manage  their improvement actions in this area.\n\n## Chemical risk management 4.2.1.3\n\nFor  many  years,  Saint-Gobain  has  been  committed  to reducing  and  controlling  the  risks associated with chemicals (hazardous substances and products, and dust). Three  complementary  tools  have  been  developed  to support the sites in managing chemical risks:\n\n- the internal standard and its implementation guide on /uni25A0 the  assessment  and  control  of  the  risk  linked  to chemical agents enables industrial sites to carry out a periodic assessment of exposure to hazardous substances according to precise minimum rules. It is supplemented by risk management guides (ventilation and  personal  protective  equipment,  examples  of chemical management and storage procedures, activity-specific  product  inventories,  etc.)  as  well  as training kits;\n- the  SBASE  database  provides  a  list  of  chemical /uni25A0 substances  and  their  classification.  This  database  is updated on an ongoing basis in response to changes in the classification of the different regulatory frameworks such as REACH in Europe. SBASE is managed by the Group's EHS Department;\n- the SAFHEAR management tool allows each industrial /uni25A0 site to prepare and document its own inventory of the chemical  substances  and  products  used  and  also potentially generated  during  industrial production processes. In the second phase, it allows sites to make and document exposures. These data are consolidated worldwide.\n\nThe  inventory  of  products  and  substances  used  by Saint-Gobain entities is a continuous improvement process. In 2020, new indicators from the SAFHEAR tool were communicated to countries and entities to help them manage  chemical  risk  according  to  the  new  risk assessment and control standard implemented in September/uni00A02019. Since January/uni00A02021, these indicators are communicated  every  three  months  to  encourage  the updating  in  SAFHEAR  of  chemical  inventories  and  the results of risk assessments. At the end of 2021, 66% of the sites updated their inventory in SAFHEAR, following the new rules. The Group's objective is to have 100% of its sites covered by an up-to-date inventory by the end of 2025 (see chapter 4, section 2.1).\n\nTraining,  educational  materials  and  technical  assistance help develop the skills of EHS managers on site. In 2021, more than 450/uni00A0people were trained in the standard and related tools, 24 tutorials were developed and 15 technical videos were made available.\n\n3",

The 'HICE Noise' indicator was rolled out  in  2021  (see  this  chapter,  section/uni00A04.2.1.2).  A  noise assessment  standard  and  a  guide  for  implementing technical and individual protection methods are available.\n\nA standard for assessing factors that may contribute to the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders and a grid for detecting ergonomic factors were developed in 2021. The ergonomics standard lists the risk factors to be assessed and  specifies  the  method  for  assessing  these  risks,  in particular  on  the  basis  of  international  standards  (for example, EN  ISO/uni00A014738:2008 and  ISO/uni00A011228-3). The detection grid is an easy-to-use tool that lists the criteria to be assessed. It aims to identify improvements to be made to a work situation through a before/after rating.\n\nThe Group finally has a set of information and precautions as to the use of exoskeletons. A dedicated platform brings together the results of the work and recommendations of the INRS ( Institut National de Recherche et de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 the French national research and safety institute for the prevention of Occupational Accidents and Diseases) and the IFA ( Institut f\u00fcr Arbeitsschutz der Deutschen Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung -the institute for occupational health and safety of German social insurance body  covering  accidents)  to  cover  the  use  of  an exoskeleton for the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).\n\n## Safety 4.2.2\n\nSaint-Gobain  ensures  that  all  employees  on  its  sites, including  temporary  workers  and  subcontractors,  have safe working conditions and environments by identifying, reducing and controlling risks.\n\nAt the highest level, the management has demonstrated its involvement in the development of a culture of safety within the Group. All meetings of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee include safety performance reviews. Operational management is responsible everywhere and guarantees all aspects of safety: objectives,  action  plans  and  performance  measurement. To underline this commitment, part of managers' annual variable compensation is based on actions and results in the area of safety. The performance of safety inspections and the application of safety standards are also considered.\n\nTo build on this result and sustain the overall effort, the TRAR indicator has been included in the criteria for the long-term compensation plan since 2017 (see chapter/uni00A05, section/uni00A02.4.3).",

The reporting and processing of safety events are as follows for events leading to injuries. Other events, such as 'near misses'  and  dangerous  situations,  are  handled  locally  (reporting,  analysis  of  causes,  archiving,  consolidation, communication).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

        "page_content": "Promoting a healthy, open and engaging work environment\n\nWhen  a  serious  or  potentially  serious  event  (SIP  for 'Serious  Injury  Potential')  occurs,  local  management informs their superior. Once the victim has been rescued and  immediate  correction  action  has  been  taken,  an in-depth analysis of the accident is conducted, with the aim of determining the root causes (technical, human and organizational factors) and developing an action plan. This analysis is undertaken with the local management and an action plan is approved.\n\nThe results of the analysis and the key points identified are then shared via the global networks of EHS facilitators, either at an  entity  or  global  level,  and  also  with management. Alerts are circulated and shared with other sites,  in  order  to  raise  awareness  among  staff  about certain risks and to ask the following questions: 'Could such an event occur on our site?' or 'If so, what can be done to prevent it?'. Sharing information in this way helps to  strengthen  the  action  already  taken,  such  as  risk assessments  for  all  operations,  and  the  introduction  of internal standards.\n\nIn 2020, the identification of potentially serious events was strengthened  thanks  to  the  launch  at  Group  level  of  a guide  on  this  subject.  It  is  essential  to  carry  out  an in-depth analysis, and then implement appropriate measures in order to eliminate the underlying causes of these events, which had limited consequences, but had the potential to cause much more serious damage (such as a fatal  accident)  if  the  circumstances  had  been  slightly different.\n\nA  systematic  analysis  of  all  security  events  reported  is carried  out  at  Group  level  to  check  whether  the  SIP classification of an event is correct or should be made if the event has not been identified as such.\n\nSafety inspections are organized on all sites according to the SMAT (Safety Management Tool) methodology. These inspections  aim  to  encourage  open  dialogue  with  the person  visited,  on  the  subject  of  safety  and  health, following  the  observance  of  work  practices  by  the inspector. The positive points are noted as a priority, as well as any dangerous acts or conditions, which form the subject  of  an  immediate  priority  action  or  an  action incorporated  into  an  action  plan.  A  guide  has  been developed to help local teams train visitors and people visited and promote the exchange of best practices. In 2021, 444,574 SMAT visits were carried out in the Group, which  represents  a  ratio  of  2.3  visits  per  employee, temporary worker and permanent subcontractor.\n\nNumerous  training  and  information  materials  and  tools have been developed or updated to support local teams in identifying and managing risk situations. For example, the tool \"60s to Think\" has been adapted to a more modern format  and  a  communication  on  the  concept  \"Dare  to Take Care\" has been distributed.\n\n## Solid results 4.2.2.2\n\nIn  2021,  the  TRAR  was  equal  to  1.9,  which  is  a  slight increase compared to 2020 (1.8), a particularly atypical year due to the health crisis. The general trend remains solid since the TRAR has been divided by four in ten years.\n\n74%  of  the  entities  did  not  declare  any  occupational accidents, compared with 72% in 2019. The 'Millionaires Club' comprises the most exemplary Group sites in terms of  safety,  with  one  million  hours  worked  or  five  years without any accidents involving lost time, including all the individuals  present  on  a  site  (employees,  temporary workers, subcontractors, visitors, etc.). At the end of 2021, a  total  of/uni00A0227 sites were  in  the  'Millionaires  Club' (compared  to  228  at  the  end  of  2020).  It  values  the entities that have the best results and that demonstrate to all  that  the  objective  of  zero  work-related  accidents  is possible.  Among  these  sites,/uni00A085  are  'Silver  Millionaires' (with ten years without a lost-time accident) and/uni00A022 'Gold Millionaires' (with 15/uni00A0years without a lost-time accident).\n\nDespite  a  significant  decline,  Saint-Gobain  continues  to suffer  serious  and  fatal  accidents  every  year.  During  a dedicated webinar at the beginning of 2022, the Group's Chief Executive Officer reminded all site managers that controlling risky situations is an absolute priority, with a particular focus on immediate actions when risks related to machine safety issues or hazardous energy control of equipment are detected.\n\n## Additional efforts needed to manage 4.2.2.3 subcontractors and temporary workers\n\nSaint-Gobain's safety commitment applies not only to its employees and temporary staff, but also to subcontractors working on site. Two safety standards, 'Management of external businesses' and 'Work permits' are in place to manage  risks linked to the on-site presence of subcontractors.\n\nTwo  categories  of  subcontractors  are  distinguished  to adapt action plans to risks:\n\n- permanent subcontractors, with whom actions can be /uni25A0 conducted over the long term and whose results have been included in the Group's overall results;\n- occasional subcontractors (worksite, maintenance, etc.) /uni25A0 for  whom  a  prevention  plan  must  be  drawn  up  in advance,  and  introduction,  control  and  supervision procedures must be strengthened. Accidents with and without lost time involving occasional subcontractors are recorded and reported.\n\nAn e-learning course called 'External company management' has been made available to the countries and site teams, along with communication tools to raise awareness of the risks linked to the on-site presence of subcontractors. Furthermore, the entire purchasing specialist  network  will  have  specific  tools  to  closely monitor  this  process:  information  and  training,  best practices, etc.",

        "page_content": "## Fostering employee commitment 4.3\n\n## Social dialogue 4.3.1\n\nSaint-Gobain has made the quality of Social Dialogue an essential criterion for the performance of its HR policy. The principle of consultation and negotiation, either directly with  employees  or  through  their  representatives,  is universal,  with  the  aim  of  translating  this  dialogue  into collective agreements. Freedom of association is one of the values embedded in the Group's code of ethics and respect for it is a prerequisite for quality Social Dialogue.\n\nBecause Social Dialogue must provide concrete answers to  the  questions  of  working  conditions,  the  specific expectations  of  employees,  and  the  deployment  of  HR action  plans,  it  is  mainly  carried  out  at  local  level  in accordance  with  Saint-Gobain's  HR  policy  (see  this chapter, section/uni00A04.1). Executives in each country meet with employee representatives periodically to discuss strategy and local issues. As such, nearly 3,000 agreements have been  signed  with  employee  representative  bodies,  of which more than 20% include criteria related to emloyee health and safety.\n\nEven though Saint-Gobain encourages social dialogue at a local  level,  Group  coordination  exists.  So  the  Chief Executive Officer of Saint-Gobain meets with the central union  coordinators  several  times  a  year  and  chairs  the Group Committee at least/uni00A0twice a year. At European level, he chairs the Convention for social dialogue, which brings together/uni00A070 union representatives from/uni00A022/uni00A0European countries annually. With the aid of an independent expert, this  Convention  makes  it  possible  to  supplement  the national  dialogue  by  dealing  with  subjects  of  common interest such as safety, corporate social responsibility or the  trend  of  employment  on  European  industrial  sites. These subjects are raised in particular by the members of the Select Committee, which acts as spokesman for the Convention, who benefit from specific training to perform their role.\n\nThe employee satisfaction survey conducted in 2021 (see this chapter, section/uni00A04.3.8) shows that 85% of respondents consider their working conditions to be good. Despite the persistence of telecommuting in the face of the pandemic, 81% of employees who responded to the survey said that the balance between personal and professional life was satisfactory. During the Covid-19 crisis, the historic quality of Social Dialogue in the countries and regions made it possible for Saint-Gobain to be responsive and flexible to the local pandemic situation.\n\nIn an uncertain economic context, the Group is committed, as far as possible, to implementing solutions to safeguard employment and only to making job cuts as a last resort. The aim is initially to reorganize to deal with situations on a temporary basis, as in the case of temporary lay-off, or to favor internal mobility agreements which, associated with incentive measures, make it possible to maintain jobs within Saint-Gobain. When restructuring is inevitable, the\n\nemployees  affected  by  workforce  adjustments  benefit from personalized support programs which may result in training associated with retraining, assistance for geographic  mobility  or  support  for  the  execution  of  a personal project, such as the creation of a business.\n\nWhen companies are acquired, coordination is set up to align the HR policy of the new entities with the Group's principles.\n\n## Wage policy and employee 4.3.2 benefits\n\nWage policies are set by the countries in line with market conditions. In most of the countries in which Saint-Gobain operates, minimum wages are set either within the legal framework or by negotiating collective bargaining agreements. In 2021, less than/uni00A03% of employees were not covered by one or other of these provisions. The Group favors the collective bargaining strategy which is a way of guaranteeing  a  minimum  standard  of  living  for  all employees depending on the local situation.\n\nA general framework called the Framework for wages sets out common  rules  and  principles to ensure fair compensation  for  Saint-Gobain  employees.  It  has  been circulated within the HR network and is published on the Group's website.\n\nIn  2021,  Saint-Gobain  conducted  a  country  survey  to better identify the actions taken to ensure a decent wage, but also complementary elements to compensation such as individual and collective bonuses or social benefits. Less than  4%  of  employees  are  paid  only  the  legal  or negotiated minimum wage. Almost two-third of full-time employees have an individual or group bonus program. The survey also verified that more than 99% of employees receive retirement benefits under locally defined programs.\n\nAt the same time, employee shareholding offers employees  the  option  to  become  shareholders  under preferential conditions, either directly as individuals or via involvement  in  a  dedicated  collective  fund.  The  Group Savings Plan (GSP) enables them to acquire Saint-Gobain shares at a discount and, in some countries, an additional amount.  In  France,  to  encourage  a  team  spirit  and  to associate  each  person  with  the  success  of  the  Group, Saint-Gobain favors the conclusion of collective profit-sharing agreements. In 2021, employee shareholding programs  were  available  in/uni00A048 countries. 95.5%  of Saint-Gobain employees have access to these programs, and in some countries, retirees are also eligible. In addition to  these  programs,  Saint-Gobain  has  set  up  long-term compensation  plans  including,  depending  on  the  year, stock options, performance shares and performance units (see chapter/uni00A05, section/uni00A02.4.3).\n\n3",

        "page_content": "## An efficient and responsible Group\n\nPromoting a healthy, open and engaging work environment\n\nSaint-Gobain  also  seeks  to  offer  its  employees  social guarantees enabling them to protect themselves against the  uncertainties  of  life.  Launched  on  January/uni00A01,  2020, CARE by Saint-Gobain is a social protection program for all Group employees and their families. The coverage is defined to meet basic daily healthcare needs but also to support key moments of family life:\n\n- daily medical monitoring of families and access to care, /uni25A0 by covering health costs (doctor visits or hospitalization) at a rate of at least 80%;\n- the birth of a child, including adoption procedures, by /uni25A0 paying at least 14/uni00A0weeks of maternity leave with full pay and three days of paternity leave with full pay;\n- death,  by  providing  the  family  with  financial  capital /uni25A0 representing at least one year of the employee's salary.\n\nThe program is being implemented on a country-by-country basis, with the aim of being applied worldwide and for all employees  by  early  2023. Parenthood  measures  were  rolled  out  in  2020,  and  all Saint-Gobain employees currently enjoy minimum guaranteed parental leave at their full salaries. Monitoring of  the  program's  deployment  is  available  in  chapter  4, section 2.2.\n\n## Well-being at work 4.3.3\n\nSaint-Gobain  attaches  fundamental  importance  to  its employees physical health (see this chapter, section/uni00A04.2.1), and also their mental health. The Mental WellBeing (MWB) program  was  rolled  out  to  all  Group  managers.  The program takes the form of an interactive app and was designed  to  help  managers  optimize  the  psychological well-being  of  their  teams.  Each  manager  can  build  a tailored  program  for  his  or  her  team,  monitor  it  and exchange it with other managers or share relevant best practices drawn from their experience. There are six action areas: management  practices, change management, interpersonal environment, physical working environment, work-life balance, and personal well-being skills.\n\nThis interactive tool proposes best practices, collects the ones  identified  by  teams  worldwide,  and  provides  key information  so  that  each  team  can  implement  it.  Thus, specific  programs  can  be  initiated  locally  by  linking specific  issues  and  proposals  for  concrete  actions  to improve well-being at work. This concept was designed on the impetus  of  the  medical  and  workplace  health department and a multicultural working group, with a very diverse range of profiles (HR, EHS, communication, site managers, etc.) and with the involvement of the social partners.\n\nThis approach is linked to the 'human resources' pillar of the WCM  excellence program (see this chapter, section/uni00A03.3.1.2). It is also embedded in the Saint-Gobain HR process:  in  the  training  provided  by  the  school  of management, the individual annual reviews for managers' forms, or in the specific questions in the yearly survey to measure employee engagement.\n\nGenerally  speaking,  the  Group  wishes  to  create  a motivating and engaging work environment, respectful of the work/life balance for all employees. As such, flexible working and working from home are encouraged. This tool was particularly useful in the context of the Covid-19 crisis during the transition to working from home by a large number of employees. The well-being of employees and maintaining  personal  relationships  in  this  particularly stressful environment were priorities.\n\nThis tool does not summarize all the measures put in place to protect and promote the mental health of the Group's employees.  It  is  accompanied  by  trainings,  webinars, surveys and indicator monitoring, an alert system, medical monitoring and individual care.\n\nThis individual care can be provided by on-site psychologists, specialized external firms, or the in-house medical teams.\n\n## Diversity 4.3.4\n\nDiversifying its teams ensures that Saint-Gobain is in tune with the world around it and understand its challenges, to be  enriched  by  different  skills  and  experience,  while developing its capacity to innovate. To meet its diversity and inclusion targets, the Group is working to create an environment conducive to fairness and equality, crucial to employees'  professional  growth,  while  fostering  training and the cohesion of high-performance operational teams. The main drivers of this strategy are managers leading by example and the policy of equal treatment in the fields of recruitment, vocational training and compensation. Everywhere  it  operates,  Saint-Gobain  undertakes  to promote inclusion and diversity in all its forms: gender, nationalities, training, career paths, generational diversity, disabilities and ethnic and social origins.\n\nThe  Group  is  strongly  committed  to  the  themes  of diversity and inclusion, which constitute one of its priority CSR  challenges  (see  this  chapter,  section/uni00A01.3.3).  The requirements  to  be  followed  are  defined  at  the  global level, while action plans to support this vision are rolled out  locally.  An  overall  diversity  indicator  incorporating diversity of gender, nationality and professional experience  is  monitored  annually.  It  is  part  of  the performance  of  Saint-Gobain's  long-term  management compensation  plans  (see  chapter/uni00A05,  section/uni00A02.4.3).  The Group  is  committed  to  maintaining  a  diversity  index always  above  90%  which  is  the  case  in  2021  with  a diversity index of 91.1%.\n\nTo encourage pluridisciplinarity and diversity of nationalities, emphasis is placed on the value of diversified career paths in areas of expertise (marketing, research and development, etc.), and on equal opportunities for local profiles. With regard to generation diversity, Saint-Gobain ensures a balance in the age composition of employees, making room for younger and older employees. There is a particular  focus  on  workplace  inclusion  pathways  for young people.",

        "page_content": "Generally,  greater  diversity  requires  a  more  inclusive recruitment  process.  To  encourage  these  practices,  the ' Recruter sans discriminer ' (Recruit without discrimination) e-learning module has been circulated to human  resources  teams  on  a  mandatory  basis  and distributed to Saint-Gobain managers in France since 2018. This training informs about the legal framework and good practices to be applied during the recruitment process.\n\n## Disability 4.3.4.1\n\nThe recruitment and retention of people with disabilities are  important  subjects  for  Saint-Gobain.  First  of  all, disability awareness and training initiatives are in place in the various countries. Several subsidiaries offer workshops in  partnership  with  specialized  bodies.  The  Group  also implements  recruitment  policies  in  partnership  with various specialist agencies, applying a strict non-discrimination policy. For example, in France, several entities are in contact with ESATs (bodies promoting the inclusion  of  people  with  disabilities  in  society  and  the workplace)  to  support  them  in  their  efforts.  One  of Saint-Gobain's objectives is to make everyday life easier for employees with disabilities by adapting workstations and  hours.  In  the  United  Kingdom,  Ireland  and  North America, personal support is in place to adapt working environments to individual needs.\n\n## Gender equality 4.3.4.2\n\nThe increase in the gender diversity of teams is based on a voluntarist  recruitment  policy  and  on  action  plans  for occupational promotion, equal pay, training and work/life balance.\n\nObjectives related to gender diversity have been set: 30% of women managers in 2025 (target of 25% reached in 2020) and 25% of women senior managers in 2025. They are monitored each quarter by the Executive Committee. They have been developed by country and Business Units and  are  integrated  into  the  performance  criteria  that determine  the  annual  variable  compensation  of  senior managers. At Group level, each monthly meeting of the Human Resources Committee has a Section/uni00A0dedicated to women with the aim of boosting career opportunities.\n\nThese objectives were strengthened in 2020 to promote the  access  of  women  to  the  management  bodies  of Saint-Gobain:\n\n- 30% of women in the Group Executive Committee in /uni25A0 2025;\n- an  average  of  30%  of  women  in  the  Executive /uni25A0 Committees of Business Units in 2025.\n\nIn terms of training, an e-learning document on awareness of gender  diversity  issues,  entitled  Gender  Balance Awareness, has been drawn up in several languages and circulated  to  the  human  resources  and  management teams.  This  program  was  updated  at  the  end  of  2020 under a new e-learning format called Unconscious Bias.\n\nIn 2020, Saint-Gobain launched a program to use Big Data to identify differences in the situation between men and women in the Group's organizational structure. In addition to  the  quantitative  indicators  available  in  non-financial reporting,  the  aim  is  to  identify  underlying  stereotypes that hinder the integration of women into management bodies  or  create  systematic  gaps  in  the  situation.  In\n\nPromoting a healthy, open and engaging work environment\n\naccordance  with  the  human  resources  policy  (see  this chapter,  section/uni00A04.1),  each  country  has  implemented  an action plan.\n\nFinally, in 2020, the parenting component of the social protection program mentioned earlier, Care by Saint-Gobain, (see this chapter, section/uni00A04.3.2) was rolled out  in  all  countries  where  the  Group  operates,  with  a guarantee of at least 14/uni00A0weeks of maternity leave at full pay.\n\nA systematic evaluation of the pay gap between men and women in equal positions is carried out. The ratios on the average pay gap of Group employees are measured and published  in  the  chapter/uni00A04, section/uni00A02.2. In 2021,  the proportion of women managers went from 25.3% to/uni00A026.3%. The  Executive  Committee  consists  of  37.5%  women members (6 women out of 16 in 2021, compared to 4 out of 16 in 2020 and 4 out of 17 in 2019). In 2021, Saint-Gobain was included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year, a recognized index in the area of diversity and inclusion.\n\nSaint-Gobain is a signatory to the Women Empowerment Principles (WEPs) since 2021, confirming its commitment to gender equality. Defined by the United Nations Global Compact, the WEPs are a set of principles that aim to help companies  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women's empowerment in the workplace.\n\n## Training 4.3.5\n\nTraining  provided  by  Saint-Gobain  must  guarantee  the employability  and  success  of  all  employees  throughout their working lives. The objective is to facilitate the access to training through processes and offers that correspond to their needs and expectations.\n\nTraining is part of the Group's major transformations as it provides support for employees and availability for the skills necessary for the success of operational teams.\n\nThe training policy is structured as follows:\n\n- to support cultural transformation and leadership based /uni25A0 on trust, accountability and collaboration, in order to acquire greater operational agility and to promote new ways  of  working,  offering  greater  efficiency  and flexibility. This includes managerial training and talent development;\n- accelerate  the  digital  transformation  in  operations, /uni25A0 business models and skills;\n- foster  growth  and  focus  on  customers:  sales  and /uni25A0 marketing  performance,  product  innovation,  services and business models;\n- ensure efficiency and operational excellence: industrial /uni25A0 performance,  purchasing  and  supply  chain,  EHS  and R&D;\n- deploy mandatory training (compliance, ethics, /uni25A0 cybersecurity, etc.) and programs dedicated to Saint-Gobain's major professional sectors (finance, HR, purchasing, marketing, etc.).\n\nIn  2021,  all  global  training  and  development  programs were  carried  out  digitally  in  order  to  comply  with  the health rules related to the pandemic and to protect the employees.\n\n3",

The training programs on  innovation,  Agile  methodologies,  Digital  Technology and Data Analytics, and Sustainability are now available.\n\nFor example, the Group has launched a program called 'Climate Academy' to introduce all its employees to the challenges  of  the  climate  emergency.  Available  on  the e-learning platform, short modules present both the risks related to climate change and the actions that everyone can take to deal with this challenge.\n\nThe  annual  employee  satisfaction  survey  measures  the perceived adequacy of the training offered with the needs for improving skills, the ease of access to the training offer and the personal feeling of being properly trained.\n\nThe level of satisfaction measured in 2021 is high:\n\n- 89% of employees confirm that they are satisfied with /uni25A0 their  training  ('I  feel  adequately  trained  to  do  my work');\n- 78% of employees are satisfied with the training and /uni25A0 development  proposals  ('I  have  opportunities  for learning and development within my company');\n- 86%  of  employees  believe  they  have  improved  their /uni25A0 knowledge and skills ('I feel/uni00A0I have improved my skills and abilities').\n\n## New leadership\n\nEfforts  to  renew  the  School  of  Management,  which supports managers in the major stages of their careers within the Group, continued.\n\nThese programs are continually reviewed in order to best match  the  skills  required  to  support  and  maintain  the Group's  strategy.  They  have  been  redesigned  to  help participants build trust, accountability and collaboration in their  teams  as  well  as  their  transformational  leadership skills, essential to the Group's sustainable growth. These programs also favor the attraction and retention of talents.\n\nTo supplement these programs for talents, digital tools and  training  programs  specific  to  this  new  managerial culture have been rolled out at Group and country level for all managers.\n\n## Digital transformation\n\nIn 2020, the support programs for teams and employees were reviewed and reorganized according to Saint-Gobain's targets and transformation objectives:\n\n- supporting  people  to  better  understand  new  digital /uni25A0 tools and improve efficiency;\n- the development of tools in operations, in particular the /uni25A0 integration of new tools;\n- digital culture, including the Data Analytics Academy /uni25A0 program  launched  to  develop  and  anchor  the  skills required for data processing and their use in operations, logistics and commercial activities;\n- the  new  Business  Models  and  anticipation  of  new /uni25A0 technologies.\n\n## Growth and customer focus\n\nThe  Unicampus  program  was  launched  to  improve  the sharing  and  circulation  of  knowledge  and  know-how throughout the organization. This program uses the camps format to provide training mostly involving the sharing of practices,  with  a  minority  component  of  theoretical conceptualization.  This  format  promotes  collaboration, networking and interactive learning methods. It enables the  dissemination  of  a  shared  culture  of  operational excellence focused on customer needs and expectations. Thus, training sessions are mainly focused on marketing, sales and service offering to customers (innovation and offers, Sales and  Marketing  performance,  Customer Experience,  digital  marketing,  sustainable  construction, etc.) as well as innovation and research and development.\n\nThe Unicampus program quickly went virtual. More than 136  sessions  during  the  e-camps  were  held  in  2021, involving more than 2,231/uni00A0people.\n\n## Operational excellence\n\nThe Unicampus program also offers many trainings about management  of  technical  skills  related  to  the  Group's businesses (Gypsum, Insulation, Mortars, etc.) and to the industrial excellence (WCM, supply chain\u2026). The 'people development'  pillar  of  the  WCM  program  (see  this chapter, section/uni00A03.3.1.2) helps to identify and monitor key competencies.\n\nTraining programs organized by technical trade streams ensure  the  management  and  updating  of  the  skills required to offer the customers high-performance, competitive and innovative products and services. These programs are generally developed and implemented by training teams organized by business line: glass, gypsum, insulation, mortars, pipe, etc. The Glass Technical Academy  thus  incorporated  all  glass  manufacturing training, and also technical glass transformation training for  construction  and  automobile  applications.  Designed and delivered by around 70 experts, the training sessions provide in-depth technical content, practical exercises and site  visits.  This  constitution  of  a  center  of  excellence around the businesses enables the transfer of knowledge, sharing of best practices and the alignment of methods within the businesses.\n\nSimilarly to manufacturing, training programs are set up for the specific distribution businesses in countries where the Group has sales outlets.\n\nIn addition, new programs related to product compliance and the supply chain were launched in 2021.\n\n## Offering solutions tailored to individual expectations\n\nPrograms  are  designed  and  implemented  to  promote adaptation to individual preferences. Combining classroom training, blended training, e-learning modules or camps, they enable the dissemination of the Group's policies and processes and the sharing of best practices. Saint-Gobain University  also  offers  individual  development  programs such as coaching and mentoring.",

        "page_content": "## Talent attraction and retention 4.3.6\n\nThe 'Talent' element of the OPEN program is aimed at all employees to anticipate the Group's needs and support its strategy. It is the subject of a specific annual progress update  meeting  with  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee.\n\nThe  'SG  Talents'  program  identifies  managers  with significant development potential or key skills. Defined at all levels and in all Group businesses, it enables career plans  to  be  drawn  up,  encouraging  diversified  paths. Personal  reviews  and  succession  plans,  mentoring  and relations with the Group's target schools and universities all feed  into  and  reinforce  this  measure.  A  specific program has also been designed to support and develop experts within the Group.\n\nAs part of the drive to digitize human resources processes, a  project  using  machine  learning  applied  to  the  'SG Talents' program has been developed. In the first phase, the use of Big Data made it possible to verify that the selection of talents was adapted to the defined criteria and that the paths of the identified talents benefited from additional resources (part of mobility, training, etc.). The second  phase  is  more  focused  on  complementary elements  to  the  program:  the  search  for  talent  not identified by the traditional process, improving retention or a focus on soft skills research.\n\nCareer paths offered to its employees are an asset that Saint-Gobain  continues  to  advertise  to  students  and young graduates to attract the most appropriate talent, particularly through its employer communication slogan 'Invent Yourself. Reshape the world'.\n\nSpecific  programs  for  young  talent  coordinated  at  the local  level  are  being  developed  in  Germany,  Brazil,  the United States, India, China and the Nordic countries.\n\nThe implementation of the Transform & Grow program required  a  large  review  of  management  positions  at central  and  local  level.  The  principles  applied  in  the 'Talents'  component  of  the  OPEN  program  identified managers with the most suitable profiles and organized their mobility in a way that has proven to be particularly active.\n\n2021 saw  the  consolidation  of  the  country/cluster organizations  and  there  was  a  return  to  the  manager mobility levels of previous years (despite the constraints related to Covid-19 and subsequent variants).\n\nThe  definition  of  \"Grow  &  Impact\",  the  Group's  new Strategic Plan (2021-2025), has identified as one of its six priorities,  'to  have  the  best  teams  in  a  diverse  and inclusive work environment'.\n\nThe definition of the Group's purpose, like the definition of its  'zero  carbon'  roadmap,  is  a  force  of  attraction  for young talents, who are particularly demanding with regard to the sustainable dimension of Saint-Gobain's activities. They  both  constitute  one  of  the  foundations  of  the Group's employer promise.\n\n## Employee development 4.3.7\n\nSaint-Gobain's ambition  is to grow  the  skills and know-how of its employees while still ensuring excellence in each of its businesses, but also to be an employer of reference, recognized for the richness of the career paths offered. It involves taking into account individual wishes and the requirements of the organization, offering adapted developing  paths,  whether  individual  or  collective,  or specific to one business line or cross-functional.\n\n## Listening to employees individually 4.3.7.1\n\nMore individually, Saint-Gobain has introduced an annual interview procedure which makes it possible to ensure the regularity and  quality  of  dialogue  with  employees. Individual  interviews  are  held  at  least  once  a  year  for management  and  are  gradually  being  expanded  to  all employees.\n\nMultiple initiatives (trainings, \"Evolve\" platform, etc.) have been developed to increase feedback in the managerial or project management framework.\n\nFinally,  the  Group  has  developed,  with  the  help  of partners,  a  360-degree  assessment  tool.  This  tool  is available on request for any manager and is compulsory before  taking  part  in  any  training  in  the  Management School.\n\n## Mobility 4.3.7.2\n\nEvery  Saint-Gobain  employee,  no  matter  what  their position  in  the  company,  should  benefit  from  career enrichment. Their career path must be a positive marker, so  they  can  feel  they  are  ambassadors  for  the  Group. Promoting and enriching employees' professional mobility, whether geographic, functional or between Saint-Gobain activities, is a priority for accelerating the Group's growth:\n\n- it is an essential way of attracting diversity, innovating, /uni25A0 developing the individual and collective skills needed for the organizational and technological requirements of the Group's activities;\n- this also enables the sharing of market and customer /uni25A0 knowledge,  the  comparison  of  different  experiences, the development  of  an  open  mindset  and  the enrichment of employees' careers;\n- mobility should reconcile employees' professional /uni25A0 development with the business's needs. Offering more career  development  opportunities  builds  employee loyalty and  intensifies synergies, generating new solutions for customers.\n\nThe system deployed by Saint-Gobain to support mobility is  based  on  broad  communication  of  the  policy  and related actions, including a guide to support HR teams.\n\nAll employees are invited to consult the job offers that are made  and  to  apply  for  them.  The  new  online  platform \"Moove!\" (replacing OpenJob)  was  developed  and deployed in countries to meet this need. This platform is accessible on mobile devices for all employees.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "## An efficient and responsible Group\n\nPromoting a healthy, open and engaging work environment\n\nIn various Saint-Gobain entities, mobility committees bring together human resources managers to share job offers and exchange points of view about employees' development prospects. These mobility committees cover all employees  and  are  reinforced  for  managers.  The management  teams  also  encourage  employee  mobility and  include  applications  from  employees  from  other activities in their succession plans.\n\nIn the event of geographic mobility, the Group offers all employees  support  for  themselves  and  their  families. Finally, within  the  scope  of  reorganization  projects, Saint-Gobain favors the conclusion of mobility agreements.\n\n## Employee satisfaction 4.3.8\n\nIncreasing employees' involvement in a context of change, both  generational  and  technological,  is  an  essential challenge for the Group. To meet this challenge, the Group places managerial attitude and involvement at the heart of this approach: managers motivate and develop the loyalty of employees by giving more meaning to their everyday work and by favoring a spirit of initiative.\n\nSince 2019, a unique tool to measure  employee commitment has been developed. It makes it possible to conduct surveys targeted on particular populations and/or themes,  for  example,  specifically  listening  to  managers during  the  transformation  phases.  This  platform  is  also used  to  conduct  the  annual  global  survey  sent  to  all employees: me@saint-gobain. Employees are asked\n\nquestions covering the five main focus areas of the HR policy and the current transformation programs:\n\n- Energy: an energizing, collaborative working /uni25A0 environment;\n- Active: an organization that fosters responsibility; /uni25A0\n- Talent:  an  HR  organization  focused  on  developing /uni25A0 talent;\n- Management: a management style based on influence; /uni25A0\n- Inspiration: sharing clear objectives and a factual vision. /uni25A0\n\nWith a participation rate of 81% in 2021, over 120,000/uni00A0employees took part.\n\nThe level of commitment measured is even higher despite the particular environment of 2021 and the pandemic.\n\nThe  commitment  index  reached  a  score  of  83%,  an improvement  of  one  point  compared  to  the  survey conducted in 2020. This index groups the results into four themes:\n\n- pride in working for Saint-Gobain; /uni25A0\n- short-term retention capacity; /uni25A0\n- recommendation; /uni25A0\n- the feeling of being appreciated and valued for their /uni25A0 work.\n\nIn accordance with the HR organization, each country or BU  is  able  to  obtain  results  for  its  own  scope  and  is responsible  for  circulating the results, and  starting dialogue with employees to define action plans to work on areas requiring improvement.",

The operating margin for 2021 came in at an annual record high of 11.8% ( versus 10.7% in 2020 and 10.6% in 2019), supported by good momentum in volumes.\n\nIndia delivered a strong performance in 2021, despite an unstable health situation throughout the year. The Group captured market share in the country, thanks to its leadership in promoting energy- and resource-efficient buildings, an integrated and innovative range of solutions for the residential market (Home & Hospitality), and the introduction of new ranges of construction chemicals. The integration of Rockwool India in stone wool insulation,\n\nexpected to be completed by the end of first-quarter 2022, will help continue this overall dynamic. China enjoyed very strong growth in 2021, benefiting from market share gains thanks to its positioning on high value-added segments, in an upbeat market. Several development projects will help accelerate growth in light and sustainable construction, including new gypsum lines and waterproofing solutions. Although South-East Asia returned to growth overall at the end of the year compared to 2019, driven by Vietnam where the Group continued to capture market share, its 2021 performance was affected by the numerous health restrictions imposed in light of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n## e.

Against this backdrop, the operating margin came in at 12.4% for the year ( versus 9.4% in 2020 and 12.7% in 2019), continuing to be affected by Mobility in Europe.\n\n- Businesses serving the Construction Industry /uni25A0 outperformed the market with 11.8% growth versus 2019, continuing to benefit from upbeat trends in textile solutions for external thermal insulation systems (ETICS) thanks to good momentum in sustainable construction. This growth was supported by the increase in production capacities for textile solutions. The integration of Chryso got off to a very good start: the company is consolidated as from fourth-quarter 2021 and sales trends are very positive, ahead of the expectations set at the time of the acquisition.\n- The Mobility business remained slightly below 2019 /uni25A0 levels (down 3.1%), but returned to growth in the fourth\n\ntransformation\n\nquarter (up 1.7%) driven by a progression in sales to the Americas and China, particularly in electric vehicles, which now represent around 20% of our automotive sales. Europe remained down, as the shortage of semi-conductors weighed on automotive manufacturers' production capacities. However, thanks to its very strong positioning in electric vehicles and high value-added products, the Mobility Business continued to significantly outperform the automotive market.\n\n- Businesses serving Industry progressed 6.4% on 2019, /uni25A0 supported by positive trends in surface finishing solutions and innovation in decarbonization technologies for our customers, such as Saint-Gobain's expertise in specialty materials that help significantly reduce CO2 emissions from many different industrial processes and applications ( e.g. , ceramic refractories for glass manufacturers).

These key challenges relate to risks and opportunities identified in accordance with legal requirements (see chapter/uni00A02, section 1.3.3). They also take into consideration the expectations of stakeholders identified in the materiality analysis, as well as the Group's environmental, social and societal challenges.\n\nA CSR roadmap was published in 2019. It is a tool for managing the Group's CSR strategy. This roadmap is based on six key challenges for the Group: business ethics, climate change, inclusion and diversity, the circular economy, health and safety across the entire value chain and the creation of inclusive local value.\n\nThis roadmap reflects Saint-Gobain's willingness to assess its performance in terms of impacts on the environment, people and society generated by its activities and the expectations of its stakeholders.\n\nIn November/uni00A02020, the Group implemented its CO2 roadmap to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. New targets for reducing carbon emissions in scopes/uni00A01 and 2 and in scope/uni00A03 between 2017 and 2030 were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These targets were therefore included in the dashboard in 2021 to replace the 2025 iso-production targets.\n\nThis dashboard update also includes the action plans implemented as part of the Grow/uni00A0&/uni00A0Impact strategic program.\n\n| OBJECTIVES                                                                                                                            | 2021 RESULTS

Considering the impact of energy on carbon /uni25A0 emissions, Saint-Gobain favors the transition to carbon-free energy by changing its mix energy. Thus, consumption of coal and coke decreased by 32%, that of petroleum products by 23% between 2019 and 2021.\n\n| ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT                                                                                                          | 2021            | 2020            | 2019            | GRI   | SDG           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|---------------|\n| Total environmental expenditure, of which:                                                                                        | \u20ac188.1/uni00A0M | \u20ac156.4/uni00A0M | \u20ac155.4/uni00A0M |       | /uni00A09; 13 |\n| a) Salaries and other payroll expenses for environmental officers                                                                 | \u20ac30.7/uni00A0M  | \u20ac26.6/uni00A0M  | \u20ac27.9/uni00A0M  |       | 13            |\n| b) Environmental certification and renewal costs (ISO/uni00A014001, EMAS or ISO/uni00A050001)                                     | \u20ac2.5/uni00A0M   | \u20ac2.5/uni00A0M   | \u20ac2.7/uni00A0M   |       | 13            |\n| c) Environmental taxes                                                                                                            | \u20ac8.8/uni00A0M   | \u20ac6.9/uni00A0M   | \u20ac7.1/uni00A0M   |       | 13            |\n| d) Insurance and warranties                                                                                                       | \u20ac12.0/uni00A0M  | \u20ac11.7/uni00A0M  | \u20ac12.2/uni00A0M  |       | 13            |\n| e) Environmental fines                                                                                                            | \u20ac0.5/uni00A0M   | \u20ac0.0/uni00A0M   | \u20ac0.1/uni00A0M   |       | 13            |\n| f) Cost of environmental incidents                                                                                                | \u20ac1.4/uni00A0M   | \u20ac0.5/uni00A0M   | \u20ac0.7/uni00A0M   |       | 13            |\n| g) Cost of technical measures                                                                                                     | \u20ac9.5/uni00A0M   | \u20ac9.2/uni00A0M   | \u20ac9.9/uni00A0M   |       | 13            |\n| h) Environmental R&D budget                                                                                                       | \u20ac110.7/uni00A0M | \u20ac86.4/uni00A0M  | \u20ac80.9/uni00A0M  | 3-3   | 9             |\n| i) Soil decontamination, site remediation and other clean-up costs                                                                | \u20ac11.9/uni00A0M  | \u20ac12.6/uni00A0M  | \u20ac13.9/uni00A0M  |       | 9             |\n| Capital expenditure on environmental management measures                                                                          | \u20ac118.4/uni00A0M | \u20ac91.2/uni00A0M  | \u20ac86.0/uni00A0M  |       | 13            |\n| Provisions for environmental risks                                                                                                | \u20ac189.8/uni00A0M | \u20ac156.1/uni00A0M | \u20ac153.8/uni00A0M |       | 13            |\n| Number of serious major Group environmental events or accidents                                                                   | 0               | 0               | 0               |       | /uni00A012    |\n| Number of 'Environment' certified sites (ISO/uni00A0140001 and / or EMAS) Proportion of certified sites in scope of consolidation | 593 77%         | 610 77%         | 610 76%         |       | 12; 13; 15    |\n| Number of sites certified for Energy management (ISO/uni00A050001) Proportion of certified sites in scope of consolidation        | 152 21%         | 158 20%         | 160 20%         |       | 7; 12; 13     |\n| Number of quality-certified sites Of which ISO/uni00A09001                                                                        | 630             | 636             | 656             |       |               |\n| Proportion of certified sites (across the total scope)                                                                            | 568 60%         | 579 60%         | 597 60%         |       | 9; 12; 13     |\n| Variation in production in sellable units                                                                                         | +7.9%           | +5.0%           | -3.0%           |       | 13            |",

In  particular,  Mr. Jean-Dominique  Senard,  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors of Renault, Mr. Gilles Schnepp, Chairman of the Board  of  Directors  of  Danone,  Mrs.  Dominique  Leroy, member of the Board of Directors of Deutsche Telekom AG and Europe Chief executive officer, Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli, Chairman  of  BlackRock  France,  Belgium  and Luxembourg and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Idemia, Mrs. Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand, Chairman of COMDEV, and  Mrs.  Lina  Ghotmeh,  Chairman  of  Lina  Ghotmeh Architecture, who hold executive management positions or chairmanships of administrative or supervisory bodies. The Board's review, described below, concluded that, with the exception of Mrs. Dominique Leroy and Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard, none of these Directors, nor any company or group within which they hold office as senior executives or exercise Board chairmanship functions (or supervisory  board)  has  any  business  relationship  with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, its Group or its management.\n\nAs  no  business  relationships  exist  between  Danone, BlackRock, Idemia, COMDEV or Lina Ghotmeh Architecture groups on the one hand, and Saint-Gobain on the  other,  the  Board  conducted  a  quantitative  and qualitative review of the situation of Mrs. Dominique Leroy and Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard and of business relationship between Deutsche Telekom and the Renault Alliance (Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi), on the one hand, and Saint-Gobain, on the other.\n\nThe business transactions between each of these groups and  Saint-Gobain,  all  activities  combined  worldwide, represent regarding Deutsche Telekom less than 0.1% of their respective consolidated revenue and for the Renault Alliance,  less  than  0.1%  and  0.5%  of  the  respective consolidated net sales of Alliance Renault and Saint-Gobain, and fall significantly below the materiality\n\nthreshold of 1% set by the Board. Furthermore, the Board of Directors highlighted that, because of the structure of the Saint-Gobain Group, its size and the diversity of its business activities, the Board's role was not designed to intervene  in  the  business  relationships  of  the  Group's various  business  activities,  which  are  managed  in  a decentralized  manner  by  their  respective  heads.  Mrs. Dominique Leroy and Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard, therefore, in their capacity as Directors of the Saint-Gobain Group, have no direct or indirect decision-making powers within the establishment of or for maintaining these business transactions. If, however, for any  extraordinary  reason,  such  an  issue  should  be discussed  by  the  Board,  the  Board's  internal  rules regarding conflict of interest are such that the Director concerned would be required to inform the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Lead independent Director of his situation, and to abstain from participating in such debates or deliberations on the matter in question (see Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2).\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Board considered that Mrs. Dominique Leroy and Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard do not have,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  significant  business relationships  with  the  Group  that  could  affect  their freedom of judgment or independence.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  Mr.  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli  is  a Director  as  an  individual  and  not  on  the  proposal  of BlackRock which, at December/uni00A031, 2021, held 5.56% of the capital and 5.05% of the voting rights of the Company. Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli does not represent BlackRock on the Board of Directors.\n\nChapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.3 deals with conflicts of interest of members of the Board of Directors, and the absence of services contract between Directors and the Company or any company within the Group.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  concluded  from  its  review  of Directors' independence against the criteria set down by the AFEP-MEDEF Code that, as of February/uni00A01, 2022, eight Directors out of eleven ( i.e . 73%) completely satisfied the independence criteria, and were therefore considered to be independent Directors: Mrs. Lina Ghotmeh, Mrs. I\u00eada Gomes Yell, Mrs. Anne-Marie Idrac, Mrs. Pamela Knapp, Mrs.  Agn\u00e8s  Lemarchand,  Mrs.  Dominique  Leroy,  Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli and Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard. In compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  Mrs.  Sibylle  Daunis-Opfermann, representing  employee  shareholders,  and  Mrs.  Lydie Cortes and Mr. Philippe Thibaudet, representing employees, were not included in calculating that proportion.\n\nThe table below summarizes the results of the independence review of each Director in relation to the criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n5",

years an (1) employee or Executive corporate officer of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain or employee, Executive corporate officer or Director of a company within the Compagnie de Saint-Gobain scope of consolidation, (ii)/uni00A0not hold a cross-directorship as defined by Recommendation 9.5.2 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, (iii)/uni00A0not have a significant business relationship with the Saint-Gobain Group, (iv)/uni00A0not be related by close family ties to an Executive corporate officer of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, (v)/uni00A0not have been Statutory Auditor of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain within the previous five years and (vi)/uni00A0not be a Director of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain for more than twelve years, it being specified that the loss of the status of independent Director occurs on the date when this twelve years is reached, (vii)/uni00A0not receive, for a non-Executive Director, variable compensation in cash or in the form of shares or any compensation linked to the performance of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain or the Saint-Gobain Group, and (viii)/uni00A0not represent a major shareholder of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain.\n\n## Diversity policy, complementarity of skills and Director experience\n\nAs of February/uni00A01, 2022, four members of the Board of Directors out of eleven ( i.e . 36%) are of foreign nationality (Mrs. Sibylle Daunis-Opfermann, representing the employee shareholders, and Mrs. Lydie Cortes and Mr. Philippe Thibaudet, representing the employees, are not included to establish this percentage). Further, the majority of Directors has, or has had, very strong international exposure, managing groups with a significant proportion of their activities, or exercising significant duties, outside of France (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.1).\n\nIn addition, as part of its self-assessment conducted in 2021 (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.4), the Board of Directors was of the opinion that its composition satisfactorily reflected the necessary diversity in terms of age, gender and experience. The skills and experience of the Directors\n\nwere considered varied and complementary, both in terms of their knowledge of the industry or the Group's business lines and in terms of innovation/digital technology, management, strategy, financial issues, governance and/or Corporate Social Responsibility (see biographies in Chapter/uni00A05, Section 1.1.1).\n\nThe Directors believed that it would be desirable, for future recruitment, to continue to reduce the age of the Board of Directors, when Directors who are about to reach the statutory age limit are replaced, and prioritize the following search criteria:\n\n- a Director from the construction, public works or /uni25A0 housing value chain or with expertise in social and environmental responsibility or innovation;\n- an Executive corporate officer who hold office or who /uni25A0 has such experience within other major groups,",

Mrs. Lina Ghotmeh's commitment to innovation for sustainable architecture and her  work  on  materials  and  circular  economy  will  be  a valuable contribution to the Board of Directors and the\n\nComposition and operation of the governing bodies\n\nimplementation of the Group's strategy as a global leader in sustainable construction.\n\nThe Directors also considered it desirable to expand the Board of Directors by one additional member in order to allow the appointment of candidates meeting the targeted profiles  and  to  prepare  for  the  future  in  view  of  the renewals that must take place in the coming years.\n\nThe chart below summarizes the skills of the members of the Board of Directors as of February/uni00A01, 2022:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate\n\nLastly, the Board intends to maintain balanced numbers of men and women (see the paragraph on \"Gender parity\" below).\n\n## Gender parity\n\nAs of February/uni00A01, 2022, the Board includes six women out of eleven members (55%), i.e . more than 40% women, in accordance with the provisions of Articles/uni00A0L.225-17 et seq. of the French Commercial Code concerning the balanced representation of men and women on boards of Directors. In accordance with the law, Mrs. Sibylle Daunis-Opfermann, who represents employee shareholders,  and  employee  representatives  Mrs.  Lydie Cortes and Mr. Philippe Thibaudet are not counted when calculating this proportion.\n\n## Representation of employee shareholders and employees\n\nMrs./uni00A0Lydie Cortes and Mr./uni00A0Philippe Thibaudet were appointed  as  Employee  Directors  by  the  Company's Works Council ( Comit\u00e9 de Groupe ) in accordance with the Company's bylaws. These were amended by the General Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A07, 2018 to provide for the appointment of two Employee Directors regardless of the size of the Board of Directors, even though, given its size,\n\nStrategy\n\nthe law only required the appointment of one Employee Director. This initiative, in anticipation of the PACTE Law published in May/uni00A02019, is fully in line with Saint-Gobain's culture of social dialogue.\n\nMrs. Sibylle Daunis-Opfermann,  Director  representing employee shareholders, was also appointed in accordance with the law.\n\nThe  Employee  Directors  and  the  Director  representing employee  shareholders  are  members  of  the  Board  of Directors in the same way as the other Directors and have voting rights. Subject to the laws applying specifically to them, these Directors are subject to all legal and statutory provisions, have the same rights and are subject to the same duties, as fixed, in particular, by the Board's internal rules, as those applicable to the other Directors.\n\nBy  law,  one  member  of  the  Economic  and  Social Committee (Mr./uni00A0Vincent Cotrel, elected by the members of the  Economic  and  Social  Committee  and  representing employees) holds a seat on the Board of Directors in a consultative capacity.\n\nThe  Company  bylaws  and  the  Board's  internal  rules provide that each Director must hold a minimum of 800 registered  shares,  with  the  law  exempting  employee Directors, whether shareholders or not, from this type of obligation.\n\n5",

The Lead independent Director reviewed for this purpose the responses provided by each Director to the questionnaire sent to them.\n\nThe Board's internal rules address conflicts of interest in the event such a situation arises: the concerned Director has the duty to inform the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Lead independent Director thereof, and\n\nto refrain from participating in the discussions and deliberations on the subject in question (see Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2).\n\nMoreover, in accordance with Article/uni00A0L.22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code, the Board has adopted a procedure for regularly assessing whether agreements relating to current operations and entered into under normal conditions meet these conditions. This procedure specifies in particular:\n\n- the scope of the agreements at issue as well as a /uni25A0 typology of the agreements that may be considered current for Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (excluding agreements that may be entered into with Directors); and\n- the determination of the persons in charge, within the /uni25A0 General Secretariat, the Treasury and Financing Department, the Finance Department and the Corporate Legal Department, of the classification of such agreements depending on the nature of the agreements in question.\n\nIn 2021, no agreement was entered into between Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and any of its Directors, and no agreement meeting the criteria for classification as related party agreement was entered into between Compagnie de Saint-Gobain on the one hand, and (i) BNP Paribas or Veolia Environnement, of which Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar is a Director, or (ii)/uni00A0Vinci, of which Mr. Benoit Bazin is a Director, on the other hand (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section 5).\n\n## Re-election of the Board of Directors and changes in its composition 1.1.4\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors may be re-elected in a staggered and balanced fashion as follows:\n\n| Date of expiration of the term of office                                                                                                   | Director and date of first election              |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December/uni00A031, 2021 | Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar (June/uni00A02006)     |\n|                                                                                                                                            | Lydie Cortes (May/uni00A02018)/uni00A0 (1)       |\n|                                                                                                                                            | Anne-Marie Idrac (June/uni00A02011)/uni00A0 (2)  |\n|                                                                                                                                            | Philippe Thibaudet (May/uni00A02018)/uni00A0 (1) |\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December/uni00A031, 2022 | Dominique Leroy (November/uni00A02017)           |\n|                                                                                                                                            | Lina Ghotmeh (November/uni00A02021)              |\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December/uni00A031, 2023 | Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli (June/uni00A02020)         |\n|                                                                                                                                            | I\u00eada Gomes Yell (June/uni00A02016)               |\n|                                                                                                                                            | Jean-Dominique Senard (June/uni00A02012)         |\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting approving the                                                                         | Benoit Bazin (June/uni00A02021)                  |\n| financial statements for the fiscal year ended December/uni00A031, 2024                                                                    | Sibylle Daunis-Opfermann (March/uni00A02020)     |\n|                                                                                                                                            | Pamela Knapp (June/uni00A02013)                  |\n|                                                                                                                                            | Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand (June/uni00A02013)              |\n|                                                                                                                                            | Gilles Schnepp (June/uni00A02009)                |\n\nThe resolutions concerning the terms of office of Directors to be presented to the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 2, 2022 will be examined by the Board of Directors at its scheduled meeting in March 2022.\n\nLina Ghotmeh as independent Director.

The  Board wanted this to be maintained during this period, including, in 2018, when the term of office of Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar was renewed.\n\n## Evolution in Saint-Gobain governance and succession to the Group's General Management on July/uni00A01, 2021\n\nIn  line  with  best  corporate  governance  practices,  the Board  of  Directors  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  has been working extensively since 2019 under the responsibility of the Lead independent Director and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and with the assistance of an independent  recruitment  firm,  on preparing the succession of Mr./uni00A0Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, Chairman and Chief executive officer since glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> 2010.\n\nAs a result of this process, the Board of Directors deemed it  essential  for  Saint-Gobain  that  there  is  a  seamless transition, by separating the roles of Chairman and Chief executive officer. On the recommandation of Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de  Chalendar,  the  Board  unanimously decided to appoint Mr. Benoit Bazin as Chief executive officer, effective July/uni00A01, 2021. From that date, Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de  Chalendar  continues  to  serve  as Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  decided  to  propose  the appointment of Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Benoit Bazin as Director of\n\nSaint-Gobain  to  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of June/uni00A03, 2021, a proposal that was approved.\n\nThis corporate governance formula is recognized as the best practice to enable listed companies to ensure the transition during the necessary period in the context of the  succession  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  executive officer.\n\nThe Chief executive officer is vested with the broadest authority to act under all circumstances on behalf of the Company  de  Saint-Gobain  within  the  scope  of  its corporate purpose and subject to the limits set by law, the bylaws and/or internal rules of the Board of Directors (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.2 and Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1).\n\nIt should also be emphasized that the balance of power on the Board, which guarantees compliance with the rules of governance, is ensured by the role played in particular by:\n\n- all Board Directors -especially, but not only, /uni25A0 independent  Directors,  who  account  for  73%  of  the Board of Directors, three quarters of members of the Audit and Risk Committee and 100% of the members of the  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee,  the Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Committee  and  the Committee Chairpersons - all of whom are extremely competent and experienced; as well as\n- the  Director  representing  the  main  shareholder  (the /uni25A0 Group Savings Plan Funds), and\n- the Employee Directors appointed by the Saint-Gobain /uni25A0 Group Works Council in accordance with the Company's bylaws and in application of the law.\n\nTo this should be added:\n\n- the  specific  role  played  in  respect  of  governance /uni25A0 matters and management of conflicts of interests by the  Lead  independent  Director,  a  position  held  by Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Jean-Dominique  Senard,  an  independent  Director (see below);\n- the ability of the Directors to meet in the absence of /uni25A0 the Executive corporate officers during or after a Board meeting  (see  Chapter/uni00A05,  Section/uni00A01.2.2  and  Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2); and\n- the limitation of the powers of the Executive corporate /uni25A0 officers regarding all capital expenditures, restructuring, disposals,  acquisitions  and  financial  investment  and divestment projects in individual amounts greater than \u20ac150/uni00A0million, and  any  material  transaction  that  fall outside  the  scope  of  Saint-Gobain's  stated  strategy, which  require  the  prior  approval  of  the  Board  of Directors (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.2 and Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2).\n\n## Lead independent Director\n\nThe Board of Directors, taking into account the development of the practice within companies in France chaired by a combined Chairman of the Board/CEO and the expectations of certain investors expressed during the Company's dialogue with them, created the role of Lead independent Director, a position held by Mr./uni00A0Jean-Dominique  Senard,  Lead  independent  Director, since June/uni00A08, 2017.\n\n5",

Thus,  each  year,  the Chairman  and  Chief  executive  officer,  prior  to  the dissociation of functions, and the Chief executive officer, since the dissociation of functions, leave the sessions of the Board  and  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee  during  such  discussions  (deliberations  and votes) on issues involving the assessment  of  his performance and the setting of his variable compensation (February  sessions),  as  well  as  during  the  Board's assessment,  the  discussions  on  the  combination  of  the Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO roles, on his succession  plans  and  on  his  long-term  compensation scheme  (November  sessions).  In  2020,  in  June  and December, two meetings of the Board of Directors were held  exclusively  without  the  presence  of  Executive corporate officers and in November/uni00A02021, one meeting of the Board of Directors was held exclusively without the presence of Executive corporate officers.\n\nThe Board intends to continue to meet in 2022 without the presence of the Executive corporate officers to discuss governance issues more generally, beyond the issues of Executive corporate officer compensation and the assessment of the Board. This option applies at the start of every meeting of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Prior and permanent information for Directors\n\nAt each meeting, the Board is provided with an analysis of the Saint-Gobain Group's operating income and net debt situation, prepared as of the end of the month preceding the meeting, as well as an update on the Saint-Gobain stock  price  compared  to  the  CAC/uni00A040  index  and  an industry index.\n\nBetween  meetings,  the  Directors  receive  copies  of  all press releases issued by Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and, as the case may be, any relevant information about events or  transactions  that  are  material  for  the  Saint-Gobain Group. They are entitled to request any other documents they consider necessary to make an informed contribution to  the  Board's  discussions;  requests  are  put  to  the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who may submit the request to the Board for a decision.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Lead Director ensure that the Directors receive the information they need to perform their duties under the best possible conditions.\n\n## Directors' duties\n\nThe  internal  rules  stipulate  the  duties  of  Directors, specifically with regard to stock trading ethics (status of occasional  insider,  closed  periods,  reporting  of  trades involving  Saint-Gobain  securities  and  the  obligation  to hold their Saint-Gobain shares in registered form), with regard to confidentiality and the management of potential conflicts of interest.\n\n## Other provisions in the internal rules\n\nFinally, the internal rules provide for the distribution of the annual  amount  allocated  by  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting as compensation for the work of the Directors and the right of Directors to additional training on the specific activities of the Saint-Gobain Group, its businesses, business lines, and social and environmental responsibility challenges.\n\n5",

On this occasion, external experts, recognized internationally and in complementary fields of expertise, gave presentations to the Directors and discussed the following with them:\n\n- the international approach to biodiversity and changes /uni25A0 in governance and public policies;\n- how to measure and value biodiversity; and /uni25A0\n- the role of companies. /uni25A0\n\nThe purpose of this seminar was to give each Director a better understanding of the challenges related to biodiversity for the Saint-Gobain Group and the consequences for its strategy.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and under the supervision of the Lead independent Director, the Board formally conducted the annual assessment of its operations and discussed the results of this assessment (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.4).\n\nDuring two executive sessions in 2020, it discussed, at the proposal of the Lead independent Director, the succession plan  for  the  Chairman  and  Chief  executive  officer  and during one executive session in 2021, the governance of the Group (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.2).\n\nIt reviewed the situation of Director independence. At the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, it also discussed changes in its size and composition due to the expiration of the terms of office of certain Directors. It formulated  its proposals and  co-opted,  on  the recommendation  of  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee, Mrs. Lina Ghotmeh as an independent Director to replace Mr. Denis Ranque, who resigned (see Chapter 5, Section 1.1.4).\n\nLastly, it ruled on the training program for the Employee Directors.\n\n## Compensation of the corporate officers and long-term incentives for Executive corporate officers and employees\n\nThe  Board  approved  the  general  principles  of  the Compensation policy for Executive corporate officers for 2021 (namely those of the Chairman and Chief executive\n\nofficer and the Chief operating officer for the period from January/uni00A01, 2021  to  June/uni00A030, 2021  and  those  of  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Chief executive  officer  for  the  period  from  July/uni00A01,  2021  to December/uni00A031,  2021)  and,  at  its  meeting  of  February/uni00A024, 2022, the Compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief executive officer for 2022 (see this Chapter/uni00A05, Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2).\n\nIn particular,  it  reviewed  and  approved  the  various components of the compensation of Messrs./uni00A0Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de  Chalendar  and  Benoit  Bazin  (fixed  portion,  variable portion and long-term compensation instruments) and the respective balance of those various components.\n\nThe Board also decided to implement and approve the main characteristics of the 2021 performance share plan and set the performance criteria of that plan that may benefit Executive corporate officers and certain categories of employees (see this Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A02.4).\n\nAs  part  of  the  ongoing  development  of  employee shareholders,  the  Board  resolved  to  again  offer  its employees  and  former  employees  the  opportunity  to subscribe  to,  under  certain  conditions,  a  share  capital increase reserved for them in 2022, up to a maximum of 6.5/uni00A0million shares, i.e . slightly more than 1% of the share capital at most (see Chapter/uni00A07, Section/uni00A01.6).\n\n## Principal activities of the Committees 1.2.3.2 during fiscal year 2021\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has three Committees designed to improve its functioning and contribute effectively to the preparation of  its  deliberations:  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee,  the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee  and  the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee.\n\nThese Committees do not have their own decision-making authority  (barring  specific  provision  otherwise  provided for  by  the  internal  rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors  as regards  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee's  approval  of services other than the certification of accounts assigned to  the  Statutory  Auditors),  and  report  to  the  Board regarding their activities, conclusions and proposals.\n\nThe Board's internal rules incorporate the rules governing the composition, prerogatives and responsibilities of each Committee, as described below.\n\nThe activities of these three Committees during fiscal year 2021 were regularly presented to the Board in the form of activity reports and proposals.\n\n## Composition of Committees\n\nThe Board's practice is to allow some time for all new Directors  to  adapt  before  proposing  them  to  join  a committee,  since  active  participation  on  a  committee requires  familiarity  with  the  operation  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  the  ability  to  understand  the  major challenges with which the Company is faced.",

The Lead independant Director has conducted the self-assessment  and  reported  on  the  results  of  this assessment by making proposals to the Board of Directors meeting of November/uni00A025, 2021.\n\nThe Lead independent Director, the Chairwoman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Chief executive officer discussed the effective contributions of each of the Directors to the work of the Board with regard to  their  skills  and  their  respective  participation  in  that work. The detailed questionnaire to which each Director responds, which concerns the functioning of the Board in particular, allows them, if they wish so, to freely express their assessment  of  the  other  Directors'  individual contributions. The Directors' individual contributions are also closely examined by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and then by the Board, on the occasion  of  the  renewal  of  the  terms  of  Directors  and recomposition of the Committees, as needed.\n\n## General observations\n\nThe  assessment  highlighted  the  satisfaction  of  the Directors,  noting  the  clear  progress  made  over  several years and, in particular, as part of the Transform & Grow plan. Directors  unanimously  praised  the  very  good implementation of this plan, and the involvement of the Board of Directors. This positive perception is therefore confirmed.\n\nThe  Directors  unanimously  believe  that  the  Board's dynamics, characterized by the interaction of the Directors in the decision-making process on all matters within its remit, and with the Executive corporate officers, as well as the  performance  of  the  Board,  characterized  by  the quality of the decisions taken, are entirely satisfactory.",

        "page_content": "The Directors are of the opinion that the Board operates well,  that  it  is  independent,  competent  with  a  high proportion of Directors with general management experience, is balanced and diverse in its composition, and addresses all topics within its remit. They highlighted the real  implication  of  the  Board  in  the  discussion  and approval of the strategy which was materialized by the active role into the strategic repositioning appreciated by all  the  Directors.  They  are  satisfied  with  the  relevance, quality, transparency and clarity of the information made available to them for the performance of their duties, with regard  in  particular to the implementation  of  the Saint-Gobain  Group's  Transform  &  Grow  program,  the performance of the share price and the monitoring of the financial performance.\n\nThe Directors also praised the seminar devoted to climate change and would like them to continue.\n\nThey  report  on  the  richness  of  the  dialogue  and  the freedom  of  exchanges  within  the  Board  and  with  the Group's management, in particular Mr. Benoit Bazin, on the open  mode  of  operation  of  the  Board,  as  well  as  the availability of managers.\n\nDespite  the  recent  appointment  of  the  Chief  executive officer  and  the  changes  in  the  management  team,  the Directors are unanimous in emphasizing the excellent way in which the Chief executive officer has taken ownership of increasing responsibility, and the quality of his contribution to the discussions on the Board of Directors.\n\nLikewise, the Directors are unanimous in highlighting the very  good  transition  ensured  by  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de Chalendar  in  the  role  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors, noting that he was able to take the necessary distance  to  enable  the  Chief  executive  officer  to  take control  of  operations,  and  to  focus  his  attention,  as Chairman of the Board of Directors, on the functioning of the  Board  of  Directors.  All  Directors  also  rated  the interaction between the Chief executive officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors as very good.\n\nThey  also  emphasized  the  effective  contribution  of  the Employee  Directors  and  the  effective  operation  and quality of the work of the Board Committees.\n\n## Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board's  size  has  been  progressively  reduced,  from 18/uni00A0members in December/uni00A02014 due to the incorporation of two Employee Directors whose appointment was required by law, to 17/uni00A0members after the 2015 General Shareholders' Meeting, 16/uni00A0members after the 2016 General Shareholders'  Meeting,  then  14/uni00A0members  since  the  2017 General Shareholders' Meeting (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.4).\n\nAs part of the assessment of the Board carried out in 2021, the Directors discussed the possibility of expanding the Board of Directors to an additional member in order to allow the appointment of candidates meeting the targeted profiles (see below) and to prepare for the future in view of the renewals that must take place in the coming years.\n\nDuring this self-assessment, the Board of Directors also considered that its composition satisfactorily reflected the necessary diversity in terms of age, gender and experience. The skills and experience of the Directors were deemed  varied  and  complementary,  both  in  terms  of knowledge of the industry or the Group's Businesses and in  terms  of  innovation/digital,  management,  strategy,\n\nfinance, governance and/or Corporate Social Responsibility (see biographies in Chapter/uni00A05, Section 1.1.1).\n\nDirectors were of the opinion that it would be desirable, for future recruitment, to continue to reduce the age of the Board of Directors, when Directors who are about to reach  the  statutory  age  limit  are  replaced,  giving preference to the following:\n\n- a Director with a background in the construction, public /uni25A0 works or housing value chain or with expertise in social and environmental responsibility or innovation, or\n- an Executive corporate officers who hold office or who /uni25A0 has such experience within other major groups,\n\nincluding  a  foreigner,  or  someone  with  operational experience in a region of higher growth for the Group (in particular in North America or Asia).\n\nThe responsabilities of the Lead independant Director are unanimously deemed appropriate, notably in his role of supporting the Board of Directors in monitoring governance. The Directors believe that his work complements the work of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee's very well. The personality of the  Lead  independent  Director  and  his  discreet  and efficient  mode  of  operation  are  appreciated  and  the quality of his work has been noted, as well as his role with investors.\n\n## Results of implementing the 2021 recommendations and paths for 2022\n\nDirectors  believe  that  the  recommendations  formulated upon completion of the 2020 assessment were duly taken into  account  in  2021.  They  concerned  in  particular  the increase in the proportion of foreigners or profiles with operational  experience  in  a  high-growth  region  for  the Saint-Gobain  Group,  to  which  the  appointment  of  Mr. Benoit Bazin responds because, in addition to studies in the United States he spent several years in operational functions,  implementing  governance  within  the  agreed timeframe, continuing development in the following areas: the climate issue and its strategic impact, value creation, stock market performance (including environmental, social and governance impact), innovation and growth levers and the regular monitoring of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic  on  the  Group  and  its  strategy  and  regular monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  Transform  & Grow plan, and of potential or ongoing acquisitions and disposals.\n\nIn  order  to  sustain  progress,  the  Board  adopted  the following  conclusions  on  the  proposal  of  the  Lead independent Director, resulting from the assessment:\n\n- for of future recruitment, to continue the rejuvenation /uni25A0 of the Board of Directors when Directors set to reach the statutory age limit are replaced, in order to support the next ten to fifteen years, by recruiting:\n- a Director with a background in the value chain of /uni25A0 construction (including sustainable construction) or infrastructure or technology or digital experience or expertise in Corporate  Social  Responsibility or innovation, or\n- a  CEO  in  office  or  with  such  experience  in  other /uni25A0 major groups,\n\nincluding a foreigner, ideally with operational experience in a region with of higher growth for the Group (in particular in North America or Asia);\n\n5",

Given the pandemic and travel restrictions in effect in May/uni00A02021, a virtual visit to the Silver Grove plasterboard site in the United States was organized for the Board of Directors.\n\nEach new Director may ask for training on the topic of his or  her  choice  and  visit  the  Group's  plants,  distribution facilities or research centers. In this context, new Directors may also visit various industrial or Building Distribution sites, and any Director may, at his or her request, meet with members of the Executive Committee (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section/uni00A04.2).\n\nFurthermore, Employee Directors benefit from the law on supplementary training, the content of which is set every year by the Board of Directors, after consultation of such Employee Directors.\n\n## The Group's Senior Management 1.3\n\n## Separation of functions since 1.3.1 July/uni00A01, 2021: Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief executive officer\n\nSince  July/uni00A01,  2021,  the  Chief  executive  officer  has  been responsible for the General Management of Company de Saint-Gobain.

On the balance of powers within the Board of Directors to ensure proper compliance with the rules of governance, see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.1.\n\nAfter studying in France and in the United States, and spending four years at the Interministerial Committee on Industrial Restructuring (ICIR) and the Treasury Department  within  the  French  Ministry  of  Finance, Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Benoit  Bazin  joined  Saint-Gobain  in  1999.

They also ensure that it evolves taking into account the Group's performance and market practices.\n\nThe  compensation  package  of  the  Executive  corporate officers  is  determined  by  taking  into  account  all  pay components (fixed compensation, annual variable compensation, multi-year variable compensation, compensation for loss of office and pension benefits), with a view to achieving a balanced mix of these components.\n\nWhen setting the various components of the compensation  of  the  Executive  corporate  officers,  the Board  of  Directors  also  takes  into  consideration  the benchmarks of CAC/uni00A040 companies comparable to Saint-Gobain in terms of revenue, workforce and international scope of operations.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  seeks  to  ensure  that  the granting  of  long-term  compensation  instruments  (stock options, performance shares and performance units, as the case  may  be)  to  the  Executive  corporate  officers  in  a given fiscal year does not represent a disproportionate share of their maximum total compensation in respect of that  fiscal  year  and  has  conditioned  these  grants  to demanding ceiling and holding rules.\n\n## Compensation and benefits allocated to the Executive corporate officers 2.2.2\n\n## Summary of the compensation and benefits paid or granted to the Executive corporate officers 2.2.2.1 for the 2021 fiscal year\n\nIn accordance with the principles set out above, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of February/uni00A025, 2021, approved, on  the  proposal  of  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee, the compensation policies for the Executive corporate officers for the fiscal year 2021, namely:\n\n- the compensation policies for the Chairman and Chief /uni25A0 executive officer and the Chief operating officer from January/uni00A01 to June/uni00A030, 2021, and\n- the  compensation  policies  for  the  Chairman  of  the /uni25A0 Board of Directors and the Chief executive officer from July/uni00A01 to December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nThese policies were approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A03, 2021 (twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth Resolutions).\n\nThe following tables present a summary  of  the compensation,  performance  shares  and  stock  options granted to Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, Chairman and Chief executive officer until June/uni00A030, 2021 then Chairman of the Board of Directors from July/uni00A01, 2021, and to Mr. Benoit Bazin, Chief operating officer until June/uni00A030, 2021 then Chief executive officer from July/uni00A01, 2021, for the fiscal years  ended  December/uni00A031,  2020  and  2021.  No  stock options  or  performance  units  were  granted  to  them  in 2020 and 2021.\n\n5",

Significant divestments  were carried  out  with  Lapeyre,  in  Distribution  in  the Netherlands  and  Spain,  in  Sanitaryware/Heating  in the United Kingdom, in Pipe in China and in various glass solutions (notably in Germany and Denmark). The most significant acquisitions in 2021 were those of  Chryso  and  GCP.  These  transactions  were  well received  by  the  financial  markets.  Finally,  the integration of Continental Building Products continued in 2021, with excellent results;\n- the acceleration of digital in 2021 with, in particular, /uni25A0 the  creation  of  a  single  global  IT  &  Digital  team (previously  divided  between  applications  in  the businesses,  and  infrastructure  at  Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain), the hiring of a new digital manager who joined the Executive Committee, and the roll-out of digital training, the 387 hires of digital experts, representing  14%  of  total  executive  hires  in  26 countries and with 31 nationalities, the increase in the number  of  plants  using  digital  applications,  the increase  in  e-commerce  sales  within  the  Group's trading companies, and the increase in the Group's interactions on social media.\n- regarding the implementation of the corporate social /uni25A0 responsibility policy:\n- the definition of a non-financial performance /uni25A0 barometer with the presentation of a dashboard of\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\n- KPIs at the Board's strategic seminar and during the investor day, and  the  introduction  of  a  new composite environmental indicator;\n- the finalization of the methodology for quantifying /uni25A0 the benefits of the Group's solutions and assessing the  overall  contribution  of  the  Group's  sustainable solutions portfolio: launch and finalization of Solutions  for  Growth,  which  serves  as  a  pillar  for documenting and concretizing the \"solutions\" approach of the Grow & Impact plan;\n- regarding safety, after an exceptional improvement in /uni25A0 the  frequency  rate  of  accidents  with  and  without stoppage of more than 24 hours (TF2) in the first half of 2020, the level of TF2 had deteriorated during the 2021  fiscal  year.  Awareness-raising  efforts,  both regular  and  in  response  to  accidents,  have  been implemented by Mr. Benoit Bazin.\n- good  representation  of  women  on  the  Executive /uni25A0 Committee, with 37.5% women on the Saint-Gobain Executive  Committee  (the  target  set  in  2020  was 30% women on the Group's Executive Committee by 2025), 25% women on the Executive Committees of the business units by the end of 2021, and continued growth  in  the  number  of  women  among  senior managers and more generally among managers;\n- with regard to compliance, the very high percentages /uni25A0 of  training  attendance,  the  development  of  the anti-corruption program, the regular briefings of the Executive Committee on compliance issues and the commitment of the management body;\n- validation by the independent third party (OTI) of the /uni25A0 methodology and update of the calculation of carbon avoidance,  the  deployment  of  the  Group's  CSR strategy  on  carbon  (\"Minimize  our  footprint  & Maximize our impact\"), the increase in the availability of renewable energy and the implementation of the Carbon Roadmaps by country.\n- regarding the harmonious development of the Group's /uni25A0 new governance:\n- the transition between Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar /uni25A0 and  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin  was  remarkably  smooth  and efficient, and the functioning of the new governance is very harmonious (see Chapter 5, Section 1.2.4).\n- human  resources  management  in  the  context  of  a /uni25A0 return to normal post covid-19 crisis:\n- the  implementation  of  close  managerial  and  social /uni25A0 relations,  psychological  support  measures  and  the flexible working  policy  in  the  context  of  the continuing health crisis;\n- the success of the third me@SG survey, with figures /uni25A0 well above the benchmark set by IPSOS;\n- the award for the seventh consecutive year of the /uni25A0 \"Top  Employer  Gobal\"  label,  which  has  only  been awarded to 11 companies worldwide.\n\n5",

The  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee  had noted in 2021, with the assistance of an independent recruitment firm, that this level was below the median of  compensation  paid  to  non-executive  Chairmen  of CAC 40 companies who previously held the position of Chairman  and  Chief  executive  officer (excluding financial companies). This amount is set for a full year and was paid pro rata temporis as from July/uni00A01, 2021 ( i.e . \u20ac225,000  in  total  from  July/uni00A01,  2021  to  December/uni00A031, 2021);\n- Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Benoit Bazin's total compensation  (fixed  and /uni25A0 variable) as Chief operating officer from January/uni00A01 to June/uni00A030, 2021, amounted to \u20ac933,281. On an annualized basis, this total compensation  was  up  by  48% compared  to  2020  (after  reduction caused by Covid-19). Excluding any reduction, this total compensation  would  have  been  up  by  28%.  As  a reminder,  the  annual  variable  compensation  paid  in 2021 for fiscal year 2020 to Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Benoit Bazin for his term of  office  as  Chief  operating  officer  amounted  to \u20ac566,184 as approved by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A03, 2021 (10th/uni00A0Resolution);\n- Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Benoit Bazin's total compensation  (fixed  and /uni25A0 variable) as Chief executive officer (period from July/uni00A01 to December/uni00A031, 2021) amounted to \u20ac1,343,625.\n\n## Long-term compensation policy\n\n## Cap on the Chief executive officer's grants relative to his total compensation\n\nIn addition to the restrictions set out below, the Board of Directors resolved, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, that the long-term compensation instruments that would be allocated in 2021 to Mr. Benoit Bazin could not represent,  at  the  time  of  their  allocation,  a  valuation (according to IFRS standards) greater than 85% of the\n\nChief executive officer's annualized maximum gross total compensation for the 2021 fiscal year (fixed plus maximum annualized variable for the 2021 fiscal year).\n\nIn 2021, the performance shares allocated to Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Benoit Bazin amounted to a total value (according to IFRS), at the time of their grant, of \u20ac2,290,656, corresponding to 84.8% of his annualized maximum gross total compensation for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nIt should be noted that since the allocation of long-term compensation instruments took place in November/uni00A02021, after the separation of roles, Mr. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar  did  not  receive  any  long-term  compensation instrument during the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nNo stock option or performance unit plan was implemented in 2021.\n\n## Cap on the Chief executive officer's grants relative to the overall allocation envelope\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  decided,  during  its  meeting  of February/uni00A025,  2021,  as  in  previous  years,  that  the  Chief executive officer could not receive more than 10% of the overall grants of performance shares under the long-term compensation plan to be set up in 2021.\n\n## Hedging rules\n\nThe  Chief  executive  officer  formally  committed  not  to hedge  his  risk  either  on  stock  options  or  on  shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, on performance shares or on performance units he has been or will be granted during his term of office as Executive corporate officer, until the cessation of his duties. To the Company's knowledge, the Chief executive officer has not hedged his risk.\n\n## Closed periods\n\nIn their capacity as Executive corporate officers and by virtue  of  the  applicable  regulations  as  reminded  in  the Board's internal rules (see Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2), Messrs. glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar and Benoit Bazin must refrain from carrying out any transactions on Saint-Gobain securities for thirty days prior to Board meetings during which the annual consolidated financial statements and the half-year consolidated financial statements are examined, for fifteen days prior to the release of quarterly consolidated sales and on the day following the release of the  full  and  half-year  results.  Outside  of  these  periods, they are also required, as are the other Directors, to abide by the provisions on the prevention of insider trading.\n\n## Stock options\n\nThe tables below present the stock options exercised by the  Executive  corporate  officers  during  the  2021  fiscal year.\n\nNo stock option plan was implemented in 2021.",

However, this holding obligation will cease to apply if and when the total number of Saint-Gobain shares that the Chief executive officer personally holds in registered form - at the date of delivery of the performance shares represents the equivalent of three years of gross fixed compensation (based on the average opening prices quoted for Saint-Gobain shares in the twenty trading days\n\npreceding the delivery date of the performance shares and the amount of the gross fixed compensation applicable at that time).\n\n## Performance units\n\nNo performance unit plans were set up during fiscal year 2021 and there are no longer any performance unit plans being vested (see this Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A02.4.4). No performance units therefore became exercisable during fiscal year 2021.",

This 2012/2 Plan provides continuity to the 2012 Plan due to consistency in terms of population and benefits. Therefore, the 2012/2 Plan is not an addition to the 2012 Plan but a gradual replacement of it. Indeed, the pension rights acquired annually in the 2012/2 Plan reduce the frozen rights in the 2012 Plan by the same proportion and are capped so that, when combined as the case may be with the frozen rights of the 2012 Plan, they do not allow the receipt of a benefit greater than that which could have resulted from the 2012 Plan if its closure had not been imposed by the Order of July 3, 2019. |\n\n5",

The Board also retained the following qualitative objectives, which were deemed relevant insofar as they reflect the implementation of strategic orientations for the 2022 fiscal year: Deployment of the Grow & Impact strategic plan in its 6 action priorities (1 - Position /uni25A0 ourselves in high-growth markets, 2 - Be solutions-oriented, combining performance and sustainability, 3 - Drive growth through customer innovation and the power of data, |\n|                                                                                    | 170% of the fixed compensation at maximum | environmental and compliance) In accordance with the law, the payment of the annual variable compensation will be conditioned to the approval of the 2023 Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Deferred variable compensation                                                     | None                                      | The Board of Directors does not intend to grant deferred variable compensation to the Chief executive officer in 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Multi-year variable compensation                                                   | None                                      | The Board of Directors does not intend to grant any multi-year variable compensation to the Chief executive officer in 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n- (1) The quantifiable portion of the variable portion represents 2/3 of the variable portion, which may reach a maximum of 170% of the fixed portion, so that its maximum amount is 113.33% of the fixed portion.\n\n5",

Data on the median compensation of employees in France are\n\navailable for 2020 and 2021. The median compensation ratio for France is therefore presented from 2020 onwards.\n\nThe France scope is homogeneous in terms of salary structure and the type of contracts taken into account, and is not subject to exchange rate fluctuations, which allows a better comparability over time. The workforce in France represented nearly 23% of the Group's workforce at December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nTable/uni00A03 - Change in the ratio on average compensation over the last five fiscal years and on median compensation over the last two years -

The compensation components and the methodology selected are shown below.\n\n## Compensation components selected\n\nFor Executive corporate officers: all compensation paid or awarded  during  or  for  the  fiscal  year  in  question, submitted  to  the  vote  of  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting (Say on Pay ex post )/uni00A0 (1) , namely:\n\n- the  fixed  compensation  paid  during  the  given  fiscal /uni25A0 year;\n- the annual variable compensation granted in respect of /uni25A0 the same fiscal year;\n- any  exceptional  compensation  paid  during  the  same /uni25A0 fiscal year;\n- long-term  compensation  instruments  granted  during /uni25A0 the same fiscal year (stock options, performance shares and/or performance units) at IFRS value on the grant date;\n- benefits in kind (company car) granted during the same /uni25A0 fiscal year (book value);\n- it being specified that Executive corporate officers are /uni25A0 not  granted  any  compensation  in  respect  of  their Directors' term of office within the Saint-Gobain Group.\n\nFor employees:\n\n- the  fixed  gross  compensation  paid  during  the  given /uni25A0 fiscal year;\n- for reasons of information availability on the publication /uni25A0 date of the Universal Registration Document, the annual gross variable (annual bonus, profit-sharing, incentive schemes,  payments  into  the  Group  Savings  Plan,  as applicable) and exceptional (premiums) compensation paid during the same fiscal year;\n- long-term  compensation  instruments  granted  during /uni25A0 the same fiscal year (stock options, performance shares and/or performance units) at IFRS value on the grant date;\n- benefits  in  kind  granted  during  the  same  fiscal  year /uni25A0 (book value);\n- to ensure consistency with the compensation /uni25A0 components paid to the Executive corporate officers, termination of office indemnities are not included.\n\n## Gouvernance changes in 2021\n\nIn view of the changes in governance in 2021:\n\n- the Executive corporate officers compensation for the /uni25A0 2021 fiscal year has been annualized;\n- the  compensation  ratios  of  all  Executive  corporate /uni25A0 officers over the last five years are presented.\n\n## Employees taken into account\n\nOnly the employees who have entered into an indefinite or fixed-term  employment  contract  with  Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain or a consolidated subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain Group registered in France and who have been  continuously  employed  in  these  companies  from January/uni00A01 to December/uni00A031 of the fiscal year in question were taken into account when calculating the ratios. The employees who have entered into a part-time employment contract with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain or a consolidated subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain Group registered in France were not taken into account when calculating the ratios but represent less than 3% of the workforce on the considered perimeter.\n\n## Concept of full time equivalent\n\nTo determine the average and median compensation paid to  employees  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  and  the consolidated  subsidiaries  of  the  Saint-Gobain  Group registered in France on a full-time equivalent basis, the methodologies  already  in  use  within  the  Group  for  the employee  data  reporting  reviewed  by  the  independent third party in charge of reviewing extrafinancial information were used (see Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A02.1).\n\n## Changes in scope\n\nWithin the French perimeter, the consolidated companies sold during a given fiscal year are excluded from the ratios calculations of that fiscal year. The acquired companies which  were  in  the  process  of  being  consolidated  on December/uni00A031, 2020 are excluded from the ratios calculations, but represent less than 1% of the total number of  employees  of  the  consolidated  subsidiaries  of  the Saint-Gobain Group registered in France.\n\n## Covid-19 effect on the calculation of compensation ratios in 2019 and 2020\n\nThe  compensation  of  Executive  corporate  officers  for fiscal  years  2019  and  2020  taken  into  account  for  the calculation of the compensation ratios for 2019 and 2020 were impacted by the reductions of 25% of their fixed compensation  for  2020  and  25%  of  their  variable compensation for 2019 (see Chapter 5, Section/uni00A02.2.2 of the Company's 2020 universal registration document) decided by  the  Board  of  Directors  for  as  long  as  the  Group's employees  were  subject  to  partial  employment  in  the context of the emergency measures taken by the French Government to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCompensation  paid  by  the  French  State  in  2020  to employees  of  Saint-Gobain  Group  entities  subject  to partial  employment  in  the  context  of  the  emergency measures taken by the French Government to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic are taken into account for the purposes of calculating compensation ratios for 2020  as  if  that  compensation  had  been  paid  by  the Saint-Gobain Group.\n\n- (1)  See this Chapter/uni00A05, Sections/uni00A02.2.3.1 and 2.2.3.4 for further details concerning the gross amount paid or granted during the 2021 fiscal year to the Chairman and Chief executive officer and the Chief operating officer for the period from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021 and to the Chief executive officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.",

It is determined and  reviewed,  among  other  things,  based  on  the results glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> of glyph<c=2,font=/AADOIN+ArialMT> specific  surveys  from  specialized  consultants commissioned by Group's Senior Management.\n\nIn  addition  to  a  fixed  portion,  it  consists  of  a  variable compensation  set  at  a  reasonable  proportion  of  total compensation,  the  purpose  of  which  is  to  reflect  the manager's  personal  contribution  to  the  Group's  growth and results.\n\nThis principle has now been extended to all managerial staff.  The  performance  objectives  used  are  based  on financial indicators such as Return On Investment (ROI) and  Return  On  Capital  Employed  (ROCE),  as  well  as personal objectives such as developing a certain type of business or entering a new geographic market. Most often, a safety indicator is also applied.\n\nIn this way, management compensation is clearly linked to performance and to the achievement of objectives that promotes  a  high  level  of  personal  commitment.  Each manager's compensation can fluctuate significantly from one year to the next, based on the results achieved.\n\nTotal  gross  compensation  received  in  2021  from  the Group's French and foreign companies by members of the Executive Committee as composed at December/uni00A031, 2021 (excluding the Executive corporate officers and excluding long-term  compensation  components),  amounted  to \u20ac10.8/uni00A0million (versus  \u20ac9.5/uni00A0million in 2020),  including \u20ac3.7/uni00A0million  (versus  \u20ac3.2/uni00A0million  in  2020)  gross  variable compensation in respect of 2020, an increase compared to the gross variable compensation in respect of 2019. No severance  payments  were  made  to  members  of  the Executive Committee as composed on December/uni00A031, 2021 (same as in 2020).\n\nPensions and other post-employment benefits (Defined-Benefit Obligations in respect of length-of-service awards and pensions) accruing to the members  of  the  Executive  Committee  as  composed  at December/uni00A031, 2021 (including the Chief executive officer) totaled \u20ac31.0/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021 (versus \u20ac46.3/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020) (see Note 6.2 of the consolidated financial statements, Chapter 8, Section 1).\n\nCompensation  allocated  to  Directors  representing  the Group (particularly members of Group's Senior Management) in Group companies other than Compagnie de  Saint-Gobain  are  either  reverted  to  their  employer company, or paid directly to that company.\n\n## Long-term compensation plans (performance shares, stock 2.4 options and performance units)\n\n## Attribution policy 2.4.1\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Group's  long-term  Compensation policy is to retain and motivate Group's Senior Management,  officers  and  employees,  and  to  associate them with the Group's performance, in particular through conditional  allocations  of  performance  shares,  stock options or performance units to reflect their fulfillment of the Group's long-term strategy.\n\nAt the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors authorizes  the  features  of  the  performance  share  and stock  option  plans,  as  well  as  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries. These  plans  are  subject  to  a  service condition  and  to  the  strict  internal  and/or  relative performance  criteria  set  by  the  Board  (see  below  for details of each allocation).\n\nIn 2021, it was decided, as in 2020, to only implement a performance share plan. This plan applied to 2,512 of the\n\nGroup's managers and officers, in France and overseas: managers with outstanding performance and high-potential managers (2,429), the main functional and operational  heads  of  the  Entities  and  Regions  (68), Executive Committee (15, excluding the Chief executive officer). Grants to the Chief executive officer are detailed in the paragraph 'Long-term Compensation policy' in this Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A02.2.2.2.\n\nThe  beneficiaries  of  this  plan  are  of  59  different nationalities and work in 66/uni00A0countries.\n\nThe  performance  share  plan  entitles  beneficiaries  to existing shares and therefore has no impact in terms of dilution. No stock option or performance unit plan was set up during fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe other instruments designed to associate employees with business results are presented in Chapter/uni00A07, Section/uni00A02.3 and Chapter/uni00A04, Section/uni00A02.2.\n\n5",

Furthermore, following dialog with investors, the long term compensation plans put in place since 2017 by the Board of Directors, on the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, now include a criterion relating to Corporate Social Responsibility. These criteria have been considered relevant by the Board of Directors as they reflect the operational, financial and non-financial performance of the Saint-Gobain Group and ensure an alignment of the beneficiaries with the interest of Saint-Gobain shareholders.\n\nThe vesting of performance shares under the plan set up in November/uni00A02021 is therefore subject to the following conditions cumulatively:\n\n- service condition : to be an employee or a company /uni25A0 Director of a Saint-Gobain Group company throughout the entire duration of the vesting period, without interruption, except in a number of specific cases such as death, disability (as defined in paragraphs (2) and (3) of Article/uni00A0L.341-4 of the French Social Security Code), no-fault termination, negotiated departure, retirement, transfer to another position within the Group, or change of control of the grantee's host company to outside the Group;\n- performance condition linked to the following three /uni25A0 criteria:\n- 60% of the shares initially allocated are subject to the /uni25A0 criteria of Return on Capital Employed, including goodwill, of the Saint-Gobain Group (ROCE);\n- 20% of the shares initially allocated are subject to a /uni25A0 criterion linked to the performance of the Saint-Gobain stock price versus the performance of the CAC/uni00A040/uni00A0stock market index, and\n- 20% of the shares initially allocated are subject to a /uni25A0 criterion linked to Corporate Social Responsibility. This criterion, resulting from dialogue with investors, comprises the following three indicators, all quantifiable and published each year as key CSR indicators: the rate of reduction of CO2 emissions (10% of the shares initially allocated), the total recordable accident rate - more than 24 hours' lost and non-lost time (TRAR), and the senior executives diversity index (5% of the shares initially allocated to each of them).\n\nHowever, the first 100/uni00A0shares granted to each beneficiary other than Executive Committee members will be exempt from the performance conditions.\n\nROCE performance will be calculated as follows:\n\n| Arithmetic average of ROCE for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024   | Percentage of shares initially granted, contingent upon the ROCE ( i.e . 60% of grant), vested   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Greater than 13.5%                                             | All                                                                                              |\n| Between 12% and 13.5%                                          | 50% +50%*[(Arithmetic average of ROCE for 2022, 2023 and 2024 -12%)/ (13.5%-12%)]                |\n| Equal to 12%                                                   | 50%                                                                                              |\n| Between 11% and 12%                                            | 50%*[(Arithmetic average of 2022, 2023 and 2024 ROCE - 11%)/ [12%-11%)]                          |\n| 11% or less                                                    | None                                                                                             |\n\nThe reasoning behind the criteria used to calculate performance is based, for ROCE, on the objective announced at the Capital Markets Day on October 6, 2021, of an average annual ROCE of between 12% and 15% for the period 2021-2025. Even though the objective is reached from 12%, an ambitious criterion has been set - i.e. 13.5% - for 100% of the shares initially allocated to vest. Despite the history of ROCE rates, which only reached 11% in 2019 (excluding the 2021 situation), it was decided to grant 0% if the arithmetic average of ROCE for 2022, 2023\n\nand 2024 is less than or equal to 11%. Finally, if the arithmetical average of ROCE for 2022, 2023 and 2024 is equal to 12%, i.e., if the objective is reached within the range of 12% to 15% announced at the Capital Markets Day, it was decided to allocate only 50% at this level, with a linear progression between 11% and 12% and then between 12% and 13.5%. These criteria reflect the Group's performance conditions, which will only definitively allocate 50% of the shares with an ROCE of 12% - and therefore if the target is reached.",

Mr./uni00A0Benoit Bazin then renounced his employment contract from 1/uni00A0July/uni00A02021, the date on which he assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Nature and conditions\n\n## Severance Indemnity\n\nOn the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, at its meeting of November/uni00A022, 2018, your Board of Directors authorized the insertion in Benoit Bazin's employment contract, which is suspended as of January/uni00A01, 2019 during the term of his office, of a severance indemnity ('Severance Indemnity'). This Severance Indemnity shall be due in the event of termination of his employment contract (i)/uni00A0under conditions giving rise to payment of the Indemnity related to the Employment Contract (as defined below under 'Non-compete Indemnity') or (ii)/uni00A0in the event of resignation from his employment contract following a Forced Resignation (1) , provided that termination of the employment contract is notified within 12/uni00A0months following the termination of his duties as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nNo Severance Indemnity will be due if the termination of the office or employment contract occurs because of a gross or serious misconduct or serious misconduct not related to his duties, or a resignation that is not a Forced Resignation. Similarly, no Severance Indemnity will be due if he has the possibility to claim retirement benefits.\n\nIn the event of a Forced Resignation from his duties as Chief Operating Officer, Benoit Bazin may notify the company that this Forced Resignation also constitutes a notice of resignation from his salaried functions; in this case, there will be no grounds for payment by the company of an Indemnity related to the Employment Contract (as defined below under 'Non-compete Indemnity'). However, a Forced Resignation shall trigger the payment of the Severance Indemnity within the limits and conditions set out in this section.\n\nA Severance Indemnity constitutes a contractual indemnity. It shall be made in addition to the Indemnity related to the Employment  Contract,  which  relates  to  the  seniority  acquired  as  an  employee  and  is  not  subject  to  performance conditions. The Severance Indemnity is subject to the performance conditions described below.\n\n## Amount of the Severance Indemnity\n\nIts gross amount must be such that the sum of the Indemnity related to the Employment Contract, the Non-compete Indemnity (if applicable) and the Severance Indemnity does not, under any circumstances, exceed twice the Reference Compensation (as defined below under 'Non-compete Indemnity') (the 'Overall Cap').\n\nThe gross amount of the Severance Indemnity shall be equal to the difference between twice the amount of the Reference Compensation and the sum of the Indemnity related to the Employment Contract and (if applicable) the Non-compete Indemnity.\n\n## Performance condition\n\nThe payment of the Severance Indemnity shall be subject to the fulfillment of a performance condition defined as the grant by the Board of Directors, on average for all previous three full fiscal years during which he held the position of Chief Operating Officer that ended prior to the date of termination of his duties, of a variable compensation portion at least equal to half of the maximum amount set for that variable portion.\n\nThe payment of the Severance Indemnity shall be subject to the prior recognition by the Board of Directors, after consultation with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, of the fulfillment of said performance condition assessed on the date of termination of his duties as Chief Operating Officer, and the waiver of all proceedings and actions by Benoit Bazin.\n\n- (1)  'Forced Resignation' means a resignation from the duties of executive corporate officer that occurs within the twelve months following (i) the date of approval by the General Shareholders' Meeting of a merger or a demerger affecting Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, or (ii) the effective date on which a third party or group of investors acting in",

This clause stipulates a firm and irrevocable non-compete commitment from Benoit Bazin to the benefit of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, for a period of one year following the termination  of  his  employment  contract,  for  any  reason  whatsoever,  provided  that  such  termination  occurs  within 12/uni00A0months following the termination of his duties as Chief Operating Officer.\n\n## Amount of the Non-compete Indemnity\n\nIn consideration of this undertaking, Benoit Bazin shall receive a Non-compete Indemnity, including any paid leave indemnity, of an amount equal to, unless it is reduced under the circumstances specified in the following paragraph, Benoit Bazin's gross total annual compensation as Chief Operating Officer, defined as the sum of the fixed portion of his compensation, on an annual basis, as Chief Operating Officer received on the date of termination of his duties, and of the average of the variable portion of his annual compensation as Chief Operating Officer paid or to be paid for the three latest consecutive full fiscal years available during which he held the position of Chief Operating Officer that ended prior to  the  date  of  termination  of  his  duties  (this  gross  total  annual  compensation  is  defined  as  the  'Reference Compensation').\n\nWithout prejudice to the Overall Cap defined in the description of the Severance Indemnity above, the combination of this Non-compete Indemnity, the statutory indemnity or the indemnity related to the collective bargaining agreement that would be paid to Benoit Bazin in the event of dismissal, and any other indemnity related to the termination of the employment contract (the statutory indemnity and any other indemnity are jointly defined, with the exception of the Severance Indemnity, as the 'Indemnity related to the Employment Contract') may not be greater than twice the amount of the Reference Compensation. For this purpose, in the event of a termination of his employment contract resulting in the payment of an Indemnity related to the Employment Contract, the gross amount of the Non-compete Indemnity due to Benoit Bazin shall, if necessary, be reduced proportionally in light of the surplus amount.\n\n## Payment\n\nThis Non-compete Indemnity shall be paid monthly starting from the departure of Benoit Bazin. The payment of the Non-compete Indemnity would be excluded if Benoit Bazin claimed his retirement benefits. In any event, no indemnity will be paid beyond the age of 65.\n\n## Waiver option\n\nThe Board of Directors reserves its right to unilaterally waive application of the non-compete commitment no later than two months following the termination of the office of the Chief Operating Officer. In this case, the Chief Operating Officer would be released from any commitment and no sum would be due to him in this respect.\n\n## Approved by the Annual General Meeting of: June/uni00A06, 2019\n\n(Statutory Auditors' special report of March/uni00A014, 2019)\n\n## Person concerned\n\nBenoit Bazin - Chief Operating Officer (until June/uni00A030, 2021)\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris La D\u00e9fense, March/uni00A017, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nKPMG Audit Department of KPMG/uni00A0S.A.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nEdouard Sattler\n\nPierre-Antoine Duffaud     Bertrand Pruvost\n\n5",

Saint-Gobain's evaluation of the impact of the risks may be modified at any time, particularly if new internal or external events occur.\n\nDue to the Group's multiple geographic locations, the diversity of its markets and product ranges, as well as its development, the Saint-Gobain Group is exposed to different categories of risks. Pursuant to the provisions of Article/uni00A016 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the most important risk factors (identified with an asterisk), at the date of this\n\nIt should be noted that there are other risks which may exist or arise, of which the Group is not aware as of the date of this Universal Registration Document, or the occurrence of which has not been considered as of that date as being likely to have a material adverse effect on the Group, its businesses, financial position, results and outlook.\n\n## Risks specific to the Group and its business sector 1.1\n\n## Risks related to economic cycles* 1.1.1\n\nMost of the Group's markets are cyclical in nature. A significant portion of the Group's activities are linked to investment in the construction sector, namely the renovation (46 % (1) of 2021 sales), new residential construction (22 % /uni00A0(1) of 2021 sales) and non-residential construction (12 % /uni00A0(1) of 2021 sales) markets, which generally follow the cyclical nature of the economic climate. Consequently, the Group's results are sensitive to the macroeconomic conditions of the geographic zones, both at regional and local levels, where the Group is active. Since the Group is established in 75/uni00A0countries around the world (particularly in Northern Europe, Southern Europe, the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, North America, Latin America and Asia-Pacific), a deterioration in the global economic environment due, for example, to a severe economic downturn or a major recession in any of these geographic regions is likely to have a negative impact on the consumption of the Group's products in the regions concerned, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's sales, results, free cash-flow generation and outlook.\n\n## Risks related to the Group's 1.1.2 international activities*\n\nThe Group is active worldwide, including outside Western Europe and North America. It is present in particular in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, particularly in Brazil. About 21 % of the Group's consolidated sales were generated in these areas in 2021. Generally speaking, the Group's activities in these regions carry higher risks than in Western European countries and North America, due to the existence of greater economic and political instability, as well as greater exposure to social and infrastructure disruptions than in more mature markets.\n\nThus, the direct and indirect consequences of political instability or of an unstable economic or regulatory\n\nenvironment in which the Group operates, in a country in which the Group is active or markets its products, could have a material adverse impact on investment levels in that country's construction sector, and consequently on the Group's businesses, financial position, results or outlook.\n\nIn this respect, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which is a factor of economic uncertainty likely to affect economic activity and world trade, may have an adverse effect on the Group's activities even though the Group's economic exposure to Russia is not significant (approximately 0.5% of the Group's consolidated sales in 2021 and approximately 1,850 employees, including approximately 1,000 in the Group's eight plants).\n\nIn addition, whilst the consequences of the current Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's results were strongly mitigated from the second half of 2020 (see press release of February/uni00A025, 2021), with the operating income reaching a record level of \u20ac2,376/uni00A0million in the first half of 2021, the implementation, in the context of new waves of the pandemic, of new restrictive measures, could lead to further economic slowdowns in the markets in which the Group operates, or affect global production chains, local supply or transport, or more generally could affect the global economy again. This could have an adverse impact on the Group's financial position, results or outlook (see Chapter/uni00A04, Section 1.5). However, most of the Group's activities are local, with products manufactured and sold locally, and largely local sourcing.\n\nMoreover, legal or regulatory changes applicable to the Group's activities (involving, among other things, taxation, restrictions on capital transfers, customs duties, intellectual property and import and export licenses, the employment system or health, safety or the environment) could significantly increase the Group's costs in the various countries in which it is active, or limit its ability to freely transfer its capital, and consequently have a material adverse impact on its businesses, financial position, results and outlook.",

        "page_content": "Lastly,  the  Group  operates  in  an  uncertain  geopolitical climate where trade tensions such as those that may arise from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine or those between  China  and  the  United  States,  are  becoming increasingly prominent. The Group mainly operates in local markets (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section 1.2.1), although some of its manufacturing  activities  have  global  value  chains  (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section 1.2.2) and could be subject to political and  trade  tensions,  such  as  the  automotive  industry. Further  deterioration  of  global  trade  relations  could therefore have an adverse effect on the Group's results and outlook in these business sectors. As of the date of this Universal Registration Document, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has no significant negative impact on the value chains of the Group's activities.\n\n## Risks related to innovation and 1.1.3 digital revolution\n\nThe  Group  has  placed  innovation  at  the  heart  of  its strategy (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section 3.3) in order to remain competitive  and  maintain  a  high  level  of  operational excellence and financial and non-financial performance.\n\nCertain  markets  in  which  the  Group  operates  have undergone  rapid  change  with  the  introduction  of  new practices,  products  and  solutions  (for  instance,  off-site manufacturing, 3D printing and digital construction), new technologies and communication and distribution channels using digital tools and content (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section 3.3.2). The success of the Group depends on its capacity to keep pace with these changes at all times and integrate these new  technologies  into  its product offerings,  in  order  to  respond  effectively  to  customers' needs.\n\nAfter the success, one year in advance, of the Transform & Grow  program  set  up  in  November/uni00A02018,  one  of  the challenges  of  which,  in  terms  of  innovation  and  digital transformation,  was  to  optimally  reconcile,  on  the  one hand,  initiatives  and  coordination  of  marketing  policies and strategic innovations on a global scale, and, on the other hand, necessary local adaptations or initiatives to meet the needs of local markets and customers in the most  relevant  and  efficient  way  possible  (in  particular sales channels, logistics offer, etc.), the new strategic plan Grow  &  Impact,  announced  to  investors  on  October/uni00A06, 2021, continues this digital transformation objective. The Group may not be in a position to respond fully to these challenges, which could adversely affect its sales, results or outlook.\n\nThe Group's innovation policy notably also comprises an ambitious  marketing  approach  which  seeks  to  better understand, anticipate and respond to customer requirements,  working  where  applicable  directly  with Research and Development to supply customized solutions. This policy of marketing  innovation  and operational excellence, which is based in particular on a specific strategic watch, requires significant investments in research and development (\u20ac447 million at December/uni00A031, 2021, i.e. 28% of the Group's total investments as well as an appropriate recruitment and training policy, particularly in the  new  professions  resulting  from  the  digital  boom (digital marketing, professions linked to the use of data, the development of digital platforms, and Industry 4.0 for example, see Chapter/uni00A02, Section 3.3.2.5), whose expected benefits cannot be guaranteed.\n\nThe Group's sales, operating margins and results could be affected  if  it  fails  to  invest  or  invests  insufficiently  in appropriate technologies related to digital transformation, or its incapacity to rapidly bring new products to market, if the Group's new products do not adequately address customer  needs  or  if  competing  products  are  quickly introduced.\n\n## Intellectual property risks 1.1.4\n\nThe  growth  in  the  Group's  activities  relies  on  the protection  of  its  manufacturing  secrets,  patents  (more than 450 patents registered in 2021, brands and models, and other intellectual property rights (for a description of the Group's portfolio of patents and brands, see Chapter/uni00A01, Sections 1.4 and 4). If the Group was unable to obtain, protect and preserve its intellectual property rights, or its freedom  to  operate,  this  could  result  in  the  loss  of  its exclusive rights to use technologies and processes, which could have a material adverse effect on its results.\n\nThe Group has an active policy for the protection of its intellectual property rights but cannot rule out the risk of its products being counterfeited, the appropriation or illicit use of its intellectual property rights or an unfavorable ruling by the courts.\n\nThe Group may be forced to take legal action against third parties  suspected  of  breaching  its  rights.  Any  such proceedings may give rise to significant costs and hamper growth in sales of the products manufactured using the rights concerned or force the Group to incur additional expenses to develop other technologies that do not use the disputed technology.\n\n## Risks related to the supply of 1.1.5 energy and raw materials and changes in the cost of energy and raw materials\n\nThe Group's industrial activities, some of which consume high levels of energy, such as Building and Automobile Glass, Insulation or Gypsum (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section 4 for a description  of  these  activities),  or  are  dependent  on certain raw materials, could be impacted by a significant increase in prices resulting from difficulties in sourcing raw materials and/or energy ( e.g. natural gas or electricity), or by the occurrence of natural disasters, extreme weather conditions,  or  geopolitical  circumstances  such  as  the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. By way of illustration, as of December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group's irrevocable purchase commitments  relating  to  raw  materials  and  energy represented \u20ac1.6 billion (see Note/uni00A05.5.1 to the consolidated financial statements, Chapter/uni00A08, Section 1). In the current context of accelerating energy cost inflation, Saint-Gobain has  stated  that  it  expects  its  energy  and  raw  material costs to increase by around \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion in 2021 compared to 2020 (compared to a previous annual estimate made at the end of July/uni00A02021 of \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion), of which \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion for the second half of 2021 alone. This increase in inflation mainly concerns the cost of energy in Europe, where the Group has hedges for natural gas and electricity, up to 50% in the fourth quarter of 2021, 65% in 2022 and 25% in 2023, at prices slightly higher than in 2020.\n\n6",

        "page_content": "Risk factors\n\nIts ability to pass on these cost increases to its customers depends to a large extent on market conditions and commercial practices. Even in the event of repercussions for the Group, it may only pass these on to its customers in part and/or gradually over time. The Group's inability to immediately and/or fully pass on increases in the cost of raw materials and/or energy in the short term could have a material adverse effect on its operations, financial position or results\n\nThe Group has set up hedging arrangements for some of the risks associated with the cost of energy and/or raw materials (see Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A010.1 Financial Risks to the consolidated financial statements). Nevertheless, it cannot guarantee that these hedges, which themselves represent a cost for the Group, will fully cover any additional costs incurred as a result of future price increases in the cost of energy and/or raw materials; they will depend on the underlying cost assumptions applied by the Group.\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks 1.1.6\n\nThe Group could incur significant expenses and be exposed to environmental liabilities as a result of its operation of past, present or future industrial sites (see Note/uni00A09 to the consolidated financial statements, Chapter/uni00A08, Section 1).\n\nThe industrial and environmental risks arising from the operation of some sites primarily relate to the storage of certain hazardous substances.\n\nAs at December/uni00A031, 2021, seven sites were classified under Directive No. 2012/18/EU on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, known as 'Seveso/uni00A0III'. These industrial sites are subject to specific regulations and close supervision by the competent authorities and the Group's Environment, Health and Safety Department.\n\nThese sites include Balsta (Gypsum) in Sweden, storing liquid natural gas, Etolikon (Gypsum) in Greece and Stjordal (Insulation) in Norway, storing liquefied petroleum gas, and Sully-sur-Loire (Sekurit-Transport) in France, storing combustive liquids, which fall under the 'low threshold' defined by the 'Seveso/uni00A0III' Directive. Three other facilities are classified as 'upper threshold': the Bagneaux-sur-Loing site (Flat Glass) in France, which stores arsenic (AS2O3), the Carrascal del Rio site (Flat Glass) in Spain, which stores hydrofluoric acid (HF), and the site in Boston, Lincolnshire (Building Distribution) in the United Kingdom, which stores petroleum products.\n\nAfter identifying accident risks and their potential impact on the environment, preventive measures were implemented at these facilities, covering the design and construction of storage areas, as well as the manner in which they are used and maintained. Internal contingency plans have been developed to respond to incidents. The financial consequences of personal injury and damage to property that may arise by accident from plant operations are covered by the current Group civil liability and environment impairment liability insurance programs (for a description of these programs, see Chapter/uni00A06, Section/uni00A01.5.2), with the exception of the Bagneaux-sur-Loing plant, which is insured under a\n\nspecific policy subscribed by the joint venture operating the facility. In the event of an industrial accident, compensation payments to victims would be organized jointly by the company, the insurance broker and the insurer.\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group also has to deal with risks relating to chronic pollution, and could therefore be required to incur expenses to restore active or closed industrial sites, whether in operation or closed, or clean up the environment. At December/uni00A031, 2021, 72 European Group sites are classified as 'IED' installations as defined by Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions, and are subject to integrated pollution prevention and control regulations.\n\nA breach of these regulations could result in fines or other civil, administrative or criminal penalties, specifically the withdrawal of permits and licenses needed for the activities in question to continue operation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's sales, results, free cash flow generation and its outlook.\n\nLastly, changes in environmental regulations, including their interpretation, and consideration of climate change risks (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A02.1) could cause the Group to incur significant expenses and/or investments.\n\n## Risks related to external growth 1.1.7\n\nThe Group's strategy is based, in part, on external growth, in particular by acquiring businesses or assets, taking equity interests or establishing joint ventures in the Group's business lines and in geographic regions where the Group seeks to establish or strengthen itself (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04). Accordingly, on May/uni00A020, 2021, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the share capital of Chryso, a leading global player in the construction chemicals market, a transaction completed on September/uni00A029, 2021. It also announced on December/uni00A06, 2021 that it had entered into an agreement to acquire all the shares of GCP Applied Technologies, which is a decisive step in establishing Saint-Gobain as a world leader in construction chemicals and reinforces the Group's strategy as a world leader in sustainable construction. The completion of this transaction is subject to the approval of shareholders of GCP Applied Technologies, the authorization of the competition authorities and the satisfaction of other usual conditions; it should take place by the end of 2022 (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section 4.2).\n\nHowever, the Group may not be in a position to identify attractive targets or to enter into transactions at the optimal time and/or under satisfactory conditions (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.2 for a description of the business portfolio management strategy). The expected benefits of these external growth operations depend, in part, on the realization of expected synergies and integration of the activities of the acquired companies, and on relationships with other participants in the joint ventures. The Group gives no guarantees as to these objectives, which, if not fulfilled within the expected timeframes and at the expected levels, could affect the Group's financial position, results and outlook (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section/uni00A03).",

The  risk  of system malfunction or interruption, which may be external or internal in origin (computer viruses or hacking, service providers'  defaults,  blackouts  or  network  shutdowns, natural disasters, human error, etc.), cannot be underestimated. In particular, a cyber attack could affect not only operations, but also the protection of confidential information  or  lead  to  the  theft,  loss  or  exposure  of personal data.\n\nIt should be recalled that, in June/uni00A02017, the Group, as per numerous other companies and organizations in France and abroad, was affected by the NotPetya cyber-attack, which required IT systems to be disconnected in order to prevent the spread of the virus, as well as the introduction of alternative processes  in  all  of  the  Saint-Gobain businesses. The impact of the cyber-attack on operating income  for  the  2017  fiscal  year  was  calculated  to  be \u20ac80/uni00A0million. All of the information systems were back up and running within ten days, without any data being lost or compromised.\n\nWith a view to learning from NotPetya and minimizing the impact  of  this  type  of  malfunction,  the  Information Systems  Department,  as  part  of  a  cyber-defense  plan, introduced  strict  rules  relating  to  the  governance  and security of information  systems,  both  in  terms  of infrastructure and  applications,  data  protection  and business continuity plans. This plan is deployed at Group level, controlled  by  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control Department  and  by  external  audits  (see  Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.3:  work  of  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee). Furthermore,  a  new  insurance  program  covering  the Group's cyber risks has been set up end of 2017.\n\nThe occurrence of such malfunctions may adversely affect the Group's operations, the protection of its know-how and its financial results.\n\n## Risks related to climate change 1.1.9 and energy transition\n\nThe  fight  against  climate  change  involves  both  risk management and the development of the Group's markets (see Chapter 3, Section 2.1.2).\n\nThe Group has placed the fight against climate change at the heart of its strategy and aims to contribute to a fair and sustainable transition to a low-carbon economy with the adoption of a 2030 roadmap to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 and the implementation of the Sustainable Solutions for Growth programme.\n\nAchieving carbon neutrality requires, among other things, that the Group has access to sufficient renewable energy sources  to  meet  its  needs  at  satisfactory  pricing conditions.  The  Group's  failure  to  access  such  energy sources  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  its  ability  to implement its strategy and meet the expectations of its customers and investors.\n\nIn addition, the need for decarbonisation of the Group's industrial customers requires an acceleration of innovation in decarbonisation  technologies  for  the  construction industry, green mobility and in speciality materials for the decarbonisation of industrial processes. The implementation of new industrial processes and procedures as part of the Group's sustainability roadmap represents a major technical and technological challenge. The  Group's  failure  to  deploy  these  new  processes  or procedures, or a delay in deploying them, could adversely affect its ability to implement its strategy and meet the expectations of its customers and investors.\n\n6",

At December/uni00A031, 2021, the total amount of pension plan commitments was to \u20ac12.4 billion (see Note/uni00A06.3 to the consolidated financial statements, Chapter/uni00A08, Section 1).\n\nThe provision for pension plans recognized in the consolidated balance sheet (\u20ac2 billion at December/uni00A031, 2021) may be affected by adverse changes in the actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligation, by a reduction in the discount rates used to measure future commitments, a change in life expectancy or higher inflation, or a fall in the market values of plan assets, consisting mainly of equities and bonds.\n\n## Risks related to cost reduction and 1.2.2 restructuring\n\nThe Group has undertaken a variety of cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives.

An increase in restructuring costs and/or the Group's inability to achieve the expected savings could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results and outlook.\n\n## Risks related to goodwill and 1.2.3 impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nBrands and goodwill make up a significant proportion of the Group's intangible assets, representing (\u20ac1.7 billion and \u20ac11.2 billion, respectively, at December/uni00A031, 2021). In line with Group accounting policies, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite use lives are tested for impairment periodically and whenever there is an indication that their carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Goodwill and other identified intangible assets may become impaired as a result of worse-than-expected Group performance, unfavorable market conditions, unfavorable legal or regulatory changes or many other factors. The recognition of impairment losses on goodwill could have an adverse effect on consolidated net income.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (\u20ac11.7 billion at December/uni00A031, 2021) represent roughly one-quarter of total assets and may become impaired in the event of adverse changes in the business (see Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A07 to the consolidated financial statements).",

The  most significant disputes pending or for which the Group has received notifications are described below. These proceedings may result in a conviction, the payment of substantial damages, regulatory or even criminal sanctions,  and  may  tarnish  the  Group's  reputation  and thus have a significant negative impact on the Group's image, financial position and operating results. The total provision  for  litigation  and  proceedings  amounted  to \u20ac155/uni00A0million as  of  December/uni00A031,  2021  (see  Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A09 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Anti-trust law and related proceedings* 1.4.1.1\n\nCompetition  laws  apply  to  the  Group  companies  in countries in which it operates. Violation of competition law exposes  the  Group  to  fines  and,  in  certain  countries, potential criminal sanctions  on  the  Group  and  its employees involved. Any litigation filed by a competition authority could, in the event of conviction, give rise to the payment of fines and potentially damages, which is likely to have a significant impact on the Group's reputation, financial situation and operating results.\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group is firmly committed to opposing any practice that might violate competition rules and has long applied the principle of zero tolerance. A competition law  compliance  program  has  been  in  place  within  the Group since 2007. The content of this plan is described further in Chapter/uni00A03, Section 1.2.2.\n\n## Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission in the sanitary products wholesale industry\n\nIn  November  2011,  the  Swiss  Competition  Commission ( Commission  suisse  de  la  concurrence ) opened  an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the sanitary products wholesale industry. In May 2014, the Commission Secretariat issued a notice of complaints against Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nThe total fine imposed on all companies involved is CHF 80 million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF 28.8 million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May 2, 2016 and continues to firmly refute the claims made. The hearing took  place  before  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  on January  21,  2020  and  the  date  on  which  the  Federal Administrative  Court  will  issue  its  decision  is  not  yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December 31, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged as at December 31, 2021).\n\n## Investigation by the French Competition Authority in the building insulation products industry\n\nOn July 28, 2014, the French Competition Authority sent a statement  of  objections  to  Saint-Gobain  Isover  and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (as parent company of the Saint-Gobain Group). A hearing took place on May 11, 2016, whereupon the Competition Authority sent the case back for  further  investigation  in  light  of  the  arguments  put forward  by  Saint-Gobain  Isover  and  Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain.  In  October  2018,  Saint-Gobain  Isover  and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain received a second statement of objections, in which the Competition Authority alleges anti-competitive practices in the building insulation products market, between 2001 and 2013.\n\nSaint-Gobain  Isover  and  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain rejected the allegations in their response to the second statement of objections filed in January 2019.\n\nA new report was sent by the Authority at the end of 2019, which  gave  rise  to  comments  in  response  from  Saint Gobain  Isover  and  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  on February 11, 2020.\n\nThe hearing before the Competition Authority was held on October 6, 2020. By decision dated January 14, 2021, the French Competition Authority considered that the alleged anti-competitive  practices  were  not  established  and dismissed all the objections notified.\n\nActis appealed this decision to the Paris Court of Appeal on February 26, 2021, following which the other parties, including Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain filed incidental appeals. Hearing is expected to occur end of 2022.\n\nOn  the  civil  law  front,  Actis  served  in  March  2013  a damages  claim  on  Saint-Gobain  Isover,  the  Centre scientifique  et  technique  du  b\u00e2timent,  and  the  FILMM before the Paris Civil Court ( Tribunal judiciaire de Paris ) based on the facts being investigated by the Competition Authority. A stay of proceedings has been declared and following  the  dismissal  decided  by  the  Competition Authority  and  the  appeal  filed  by  Actis  against  such dismissal,  Actis  requested  that  the  proceeding  remain stayed until the Paris Court of Appeal's decision to be made in relation to the appeal filed by Actis against the dismissal decision of the Competition Authority. The Court granted this request and stayed the proceeding until the Paris Court of Appeal's decision.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation 1.4.1.2\n\nCurrent legal actions related to asbestos are described below.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation in France\n\n## Inexcusable fault lawsuits\n\nIn  France,  where  Everite  and  Saint-Gobain  PAM  had carried  out  fiber-cement  operations  in  the  past,  seven additional lawsuits to those brought since 1996 were filed in 2021 by former employees (or persons claiming through them) for recognition of inexcusable fault resulting from exposure for asbestos-related occupational diseases.\n\n6",

These 824 suits have all been definitely completed, representing a total amount of compensation of \u20ac8.5 million as of December 31, 2021 (compared to \u20ac7.6 million euros as at December 31, 2020).\n\nIt should be clarified that the above figures do not take into account suits filed against companies that are no longer part of the Group.\n\nThe provision related to asbestos-related litigation in France amounted to around \u20ac6.9 million as of December 31, 2021 (compared to \u20ac5.5 million as of December 31, 2020).\n\n## Situation in the United States\n\n## Action taken to achieve equitable and permanent Resolution of the former CertainTeed Corporation's legacy asbestos liabilities in the United States\n\nDBMP LLC, an affiliate of CertainTeed LLC based in North Carolina, that holds the legacy asbestos liabilities of the former CertainTeed Corporation, filed, on January 23, 2020, a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte. The purpose of the filing is to achieve a certain, final and equitable Resolution of all current and future claims arising from asbestos-containing products manufactured and sold by the former CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under Section 524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial numbers of asbestos-related claims -to achieve a fair and equitable resolution of its asbestos-related liabilities. Upon establishment of the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will be able to receive faster payment of their claims without the delay, stress and uncertainty of litigation in the tort system; at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently and finally resolve DBMP LLC's asbestos liability.\n\nDuring the course of this bankruptcy process, which is expected to take approximately three to eight years, all asbestos litigation will be stayed and all related costs suspended, providing DBMP LLC with the time and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\nThis action was taken as a result of the increasing risks presented in the US tort system. Despite the passage of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity for claimants to assert legitimate claims of exposure to the asbestos-containing products of the former CertainTeed Corporation, naming practices in the tort systemcontinued to result in a steady volume of claims against DBMP LLC, with no foreseeable end in sight. In addition, there has been, in general, an escalation of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\n## Impact on the Group's financial statements\n\nFollowing the commencement of the proceeding under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code on January 23, 2020, the assets and liabilities of DBMP LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary Millwork & Panel LLC, and in particular the provision for asbestos-related litigation in the United States, are no longer consolidated in the Group's financial statements.\n\nNonetheless, because of a funding agreement between CertainTeed LLC and DBMP LLC by which CertainTeed LLC has agreed to fund the costs of the Chapter 11 case and, ultimately, the 524(g) trust, in both cases solely to the extent DBMP LLC is unable to do so in full, the Group recorded in its consolidated financial statements a debt against DBMP LLC amounting to $417 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Group's consolidated income for 2021 is not impacted by the ongoing Chapter 11 proceeding described above.\n\nAs a result of this bankruptcy proceeding, all legal costs and indemnity payments related to DBMP LLC's asbestos tort claims have been suspended, and no further charges in relation to such claims have been taken in 2021 (as in 2020).",

        "page_content": "## Situation in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, former  employees  of  Brasilit, that once manufactured fiber cement containing asbestos, suffering from asbestos-related occupational illnesses are offered, depending  on  the  case,  either  financial  compensation alone  or  lifetime  medical  assistance  combined  with financial compensation. Around 1,200 contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambouc  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  First  and second instance decisions were rendered in connection with the first suit respectively in July 2020 and July 2021, rejecting  the  claims  of  the  plaintiffs.  The  latter  have nevertheless  appealed  the  second  instance  decision  by filing a motion for clarification against such decision. The suit related to Recife is still at an early stage and there is no court decision issued so far.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari  (State  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo)  by  the  Labor  prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages, in favor of employees, former employees and their respective families, as well as subcontractors who were exposed to asbestos. A first instance decision was rendered  in  September  2020  partly  in  favor  of  the plaintiffs.  In  particular,  collective  moral  damages  were granted to the plaintiffs, for an amount reduced to BRL 5 million (\u20ac0.8 million). Brasilit has appealed the decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues to comply with all of its legal obligations with regard to medical assistance for its current and former employees.\n\nIn November 2017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## Environmental disputes 1.4.1.3\n\n## PFOA matters in the United States\n\nLevels of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) in excess of US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or state maximum contaminant levels for drinking water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New  Hampshire),  and  two  former  facilities  in  North Bennington  (Vermont)  in  the  United  States.  PFOA  and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured by these plants. SG PPL is a processor of PTFE which it purchases from third party suppliers and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded  construction  of  water  line  extensions  in  certain communities in the Merrimack and Bennington areas.\n\nThe  investigations  are  on-going  and  the  scope  of responsibility  for  SG  PPL  arising  from  environmental remediation in New Hampshire and New York and cleanup obligations at these sites has not yet been established. The scope of the remediation in Vermont is defined and largely completed; future operation and maintenance obligations remain.\n\nWithout  admitting  liability,  SG  PPL  has  signed  consent orders with the environmental regulators in New York in 2016, in Vermont in 2017 and 2019 with respect to two different areas, and in New Hampshire in 2018, pursuant to which  SG  PPL  has  agreed  to  complete  investigations, implement  interim  or  final  remediation  measures  at  its current and former facilities and in the case of Vermont and  New  Hampshire,  fund  construction  of  water  lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of proposed or certified class actions. It is difficult  to  predict  the  timing  or  outcome  of  any  such litigation,  or  whether  any  additional  litigation  will  be brought against SG PPL. However, both the New York and Vermont  class  actions  have  signed  settlements,  the Vermont settlement remaining under final review by the courts.\n\nOn  December  31,  2021,  the  provision  recorded  by  the Company in respect of this matter amounts to \u20ac116 million (compared to \u20ac31 million as of December 31, 2020). This provision covers fully the amount of the New York and Vermont class action settlements, as well as various other costs  related  to  PFOA  matters  including  remediation works.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities 1.4.1.4\n\n## Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom\n\nCelotex provides insulation materials for specific applications for the building and construction industry.\n\nInsulation materials  from  two  Celotex  ranges  were purchased  via  distributors  and  used  in  refurbishing Grenfell  Tower,  London  in  2015/2016,  including  as  one component of the rainscreen cladding system designed and  installed  (by  third  parties)  on  the  tower's  external facade (for more information, refer to the following page: https://www.Saint-Gobain.com/fr/finance, sidebar\n\n'Grenfell Tower Celotex').\n\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14, 2017, a Public Inquiry is underway, which is considering, among other things, the modifications made to the building as part of the refurbishment,  the  role  played  by  the  various construction professionals, and the information provided by the manufacturers of the products used. The Inquiry is conducting its work in two phases: its phase 1 report was published on October 30, 2019, phase 2 commenced in January 2020 - public hearings are expected to continue until July 2022, with a final report to follow some time thereafter. A criminal investigation into the circumstances of the fire is also in progress.\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Risks and control\n\nRisk factors\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the implications for Celotex are unlikely to be known for some time. Civil proceedings in connection with Grenfell Tower brought against Celotex Limited and/or Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK Limited (which respectively held the Celotex business until or after December 31, 2015) and a number of other defendants - who are also core participants in the Public Inquiry - have been issued and are stayed prior to the service of full pleadings. No figure has yet been put on the quantum claimed.\n\nThe extent to which Celotex may incur civil or criminal liability in connection with the production, marketing, supply or use of its products is currently unclear and Celotex Limited and Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## Other proceedings and disputes 1.4.1.5\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other claims made by their employees or by the tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses (see Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A05.5.2 to the consolidated financial statements). Apart from the proceedings and litigation described above, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no other government, court or arbitration proceedings exist (including pending proceedings or proceedings where the Company and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had, in the last 12 months, a significant impact on the financial position or profitability of the Company and/or Group. Please refer to Note/uni00A09 to the consolidated financial statements relating to provisions for litigation, Chapter/uni00A08, Section 1.\n\n## Insurance 1.5\n\nThe Group transfers its risks to the insurance market when this is the most efficient solution. Default by one or more of the Group's insurers could therefore lead to financial losses.\n\nThe Group's policy is to implement preventive programs and purchase insurance coverage to protect its assets and revenue. This policy is embedded within a Group doctrine, which takes into account current conditions in the insurance market. It is determined, coordinated and overseen by the Risk and Insurance Department. It defines insurance criteria for the most significant risks, such as property and business interruption, as well as general and product liability. With this in mind, a new insurance program to cover the Group's cyber risks was implemented at the end of 2017.\n\n## Risk of regulatory changes 1.4.2\n\nThe Group is not subject to any specific regulations that could have an impact on its financial position, although the Group companies that operate industrial sites are generally required to comply with the specific national laws and regulations of the country where such sites are located. It is therefore, for example, with regard to France, subject to regulations applicable to classified sites, and certain regulations relating to the environment, aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, in particular with a view to meeting the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement which came into force on November/uni00A04, 2016.\n\nA certain number of legislative measures are already in place in certain countries and regions in which the Group operates. As such, at European level, Directive 2003/87/EC of October/uni00A013, 2003, known as the 'Quotas Directive', has set a cap on carbon dioxide emissions and a quota trading system for certain large production sites. Notwithstanding the Group's efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, and broadly, the use of best available techniques for its investments (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A02), changes in regulations applicable to the Group's activities could impact the operation of its production sites, which could have a material adverse effect on its operation, financial position or results.\n\nLaws and regulations applicable to the Group and to the materials and products it uses in its activities may change in a manner that may be unfavorable to the Group. The introduction of stricter regulations or more diligent enforcement of existing regulations may affect the conditions under which the Group operates its businesses, which could increase its operating expenses, limit the scope of its activities or act as a brake on business growth. More generally, the Group cannot guarantee that there will be no rapid and/or significant regulatory changes in the future with a material adverse effect on its business, financial position or results.\n\nFor other types of coverage, such as automobile fleet insurance, the Risk and Insurance Department advises the individual operating units on policy content broker selection and which market to consult. These are called 'high-frequency' risks, for which claims are monitored internally and appropriate action taken. The policies in force in 2021 are the result of the renewal of the policies for 2020.\n\nThe captive insurance company set up to cover property risks was highly successful and delivered real benefits for the Group.\n\nCompanies acquired during the year have been integrated into existing insurance programs.",

        "page_content": "## Property and business interruption 1.5.1 insurance\n\nThe risks covered are non-excluded property and casualty risks  as  well  as  operating  losses  following  a  sudden accident affecting the insured property. They are covered by a global program.\n\nThe programs meet the insurance criteria laid down by the Risk and Insurance Department, specifically:\n\n- all policies are 'all risks' policies with named exclusions; /uni25A0\n- claims  limits  of  liability  are  based  on  worst-case /uni25A0 scenarios where safety systems operate effectively;\n- deductibles are proportionate to the size of the site /uni25A0 concerned and cannot be qualified as self-insurance.\n\nThese  criteria take into account  current  insurance offerings, which exclude certain risks and cover natural disasters like floods, storms, earthquakes or tsunamis only up to a certain amount.\n\nIn extreme scenarios, such events could have a substantial uninsured financial impact in terms of both reconstruction costs and lost production costs.\n\nThe Risk and Insurance Department's policy is based on the findings of the annual  audits  carried  out  by independent  prevention  experts  recognized  by  the Group's insurers. These audits give a clear picture of the risk exposure of the main sites in the event of a fire or other incident, and provide an estimate of the financial consequences in a worst-case scenario.\n\nIndividual claims in excess of \u20ac12.5/uni00A0million were transferred to the insurance market for all Group subsidiaries. As from January 1, 2022 this amount is increased to \u20ac17.5 million.\n\nThis  amount  is  self-insured  by  the  Group  through  its captive  insurance  company.  The  latter  has  taken  out reinsurance protection to protect it against an excessive frequency and/or severity.\n\n## Liability coverage 1.5.2\n\nA  program  provides  coverage  for  third-party  personal injury and property damage claims for which the Group would  be  legally  held  liable.  This  program  comprises several programs for the lower tranches of coverage.\n\nThe  first  program  covers  all  subsidiaries  and  has  a coverage  limit  of  \u20ac100/uni00A0million.  Those  located  in  North\n\nAmerica are subject to a deductible of USD 50/uni00A0million. The program's exclusions are consistent with market practice and concern in particular potentially carcinogenic substances and gradual pollution.\n\nIn order to satisfy local regulatory requirements, a policy is taken  out  in  each  country  in  which  the  Group  has  a significant presence. Local policies are backed up by the master policy issued in Paris, which can be activated when local coverage proves inadequate.\n\nThe second program, with a cover limit of USD 50/uni00A0million, concerns the subsidiaries located in North America. This program is structured differently to deal with the specific nature of liability risks in the United States. It is divided into several lines of coverage, requiring it to be placed, if needed, on the London insurance market. Exclusions are in line with current market practice in the United States and primarily concern  contractual  liability, pollution and third-party consequential loss.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  two  programs  described  above,  a number of supplementary programs have been set up in order  to  bring  the  total  coverage  limit  to  a  level considered compatible with the Group's businesses.\n\nWithin  the  operating  units,  action  is  taken  to  raise awareness  of  civil  liability  risks,  and  the  units  are motivated to control costs by assuming a deductible that does not, however, constitute self-insurance. The Group also runs a risk prevention program at its operating units with the support of the Environment, Health and Safety Department.\n\nFurthermore, to meet the environmental requirements set out  in  Directive  2004/35/EC  of  April/uni00A021, 2004  on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, the Group has since 2017  had  a  specific  policy  with  a  limit  increased  from \u20ac25/uni00A0million to \u20ac75/uni00A0million per year as from July/uni00A01, 2020. This policy offers worldwide cover, excluding the United States, for the Group's civil environmental liability arising in relation to damage  affecting natural resources (protected natural species and habitats, soil and water) as a result of its activities.\n\n## Exceptions 1.5.3\n\nJoint ventures not controlled by the Group and minority interests  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  the  above policies. These insurance policies are taken out separately.\n\n6",

The three lines of defense model is therefore adopted by Saint-Gobain:\n\n- in the first line of defense, companies employ an /uni25A0 internal control and risk management system tailored to their situation, at the initiative of the Chief Executive Officers and local managerial structures (Regions, countries and activities). The companies have access to Shared Services Centers (Finance, Payroll) and IT expertise. It is essential that there is a segregation of tasks between these organizations for successful skills optimization and transaction security;\n- in the second line, Group Internal Control establishes an /uni25A0 internal control reference framework applicable to all, in addition to specific guidelines prepared by the Group's corporate departments; and\n- in the third line, it involves verification of the proper /uni25A0 application of the internal control principles which is carried out in-house by the Audit Department and externally by the Statutory Auditors.\n\n## Compagnie de Saint-Gobain's internal control and risk 2.1 management system\n\n## The aims of internal control 2.1.1 and risk management\n\nThe Saint-Gobain internal control and risk management system is part of the legal framework applicable to companies listed on the Euronext Paris regulated market, and is inspired by the reference framework on the internal control and risk management system of the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) and the 'Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission' (COSO).\n\nSaint-Gobain Group's internal control and risk management system is supported by a continuous improvement process and an Internal Control Reference Framework. This is a whole set of resources, behaviors, procedures and actions tailored to each company's specific characteristics which:\n\n- enables it to appropriately address material operational, /uni25A0 financial or compliance risks;\n- helps it to manage its operations and meet its /uni25A0 objectives;\n- improves the efficiency of its operations and ensure /uni25A0 that its resources are used to best effect.\n\nIt is more specifically designed to provide assurance concerning:\n\n- application of General Management's instructions and /uni25A0 orientations;\n- compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to /uni25A0 the company;\n- the efficiency and effectiveness of internal operating, /uni25A0 industrial, marketing, financial and other processes;\n\n- of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, /uni25A0 in particular the prevention of fraud;\n- the reliability of financial information. /uni25A0\n\nBy promoting constant improvement in all entities, internal control creates value and supports the companies' performance.\n\n## The internal control and risk 2.1.2 management environment\n\n## The Group's core values 2.1.2.1\n\nInternal control is based on values and rules of conduct which are formalized in:\n\n- the Saint-Gobain Group Principles of Conduct and /uni25A0 Action: professional commitment, respect for others, integrity, loyalty, solidarity, compliance with the law, respect for the environment, protection of health and safety at work and employee rights (see Saint-Gobain Today - Chapter/uni00A01). The Principles of Conduct and Action are distributed to all Group employees;\n- the Group Human Rights policy (see Section/uni00A01, /uni25A0 Chapter/uni00A03);\n- the Saint-Gobain Attitudes: being close to customers, /uni25A0 acting as an entrepreneur, innovating, being flexible, building an open and engaging culture;\n- the Group's compliance program: competition law, /uni25A0 economic embargoes and sanctions, fight against corruption, influence peddling and fraud, professional associations, conflicts of interest, gift policy, etc. (see Section/uni00A02.5.6 of Chapter/uni00A06 -The Group's compliance culture tools).",

The Regions, countries and activities formalize guidelines and directives within their scope of responsibility in line with the Group's own guidelines and directives, ensuring that they are applied when conducting operations.\n\n## Information systems 2.1.2.4\n\nThe Group's organizations and their operations rely to a large extent on information systems, information-sharing and the digitalization of processes. Information systems must therefore be efficiently protected in terms of both physical  and  logical  security.  The  Saint-Gobain  Group companies thus comply with the safety rules set out by the Group Information Systems Department and Internal Control  (automated  controls  described  in  detail  in  the 'ITAC' reference base).\n\n## Internal control and risk 2.1.3 management process\n\nWithin Saint-Gobain, internal control is a continuous and ongoing process that integrates risk management procedures.\n\nDue  to  the  constantly  changing  environment  and  the regulatory  context,  the  companies  must  take  steps  to identify,  evaluate,  process  and  monitor  any  risks  which may affect them.\n\n## At Group entity level 2.1.3.1\n\nThe internal control and risk management process can be summarized in four stages:\n\n- analysis  of  the  main  identifiable  risks.  The  company /uni25A0 analyzes its main risks, and thus identifies what could prevent  it  from  meeting  its  objectives,  as  well  as dangers that could harm its interests or have a major impact on its internal control situation;\n- developing controls that are proportionate to the risks /uni25A0 involved in each process;\n- communicating  the  objectives  of  internal  control  to /uni25A0 employees and implementing controls;\n- permanent  oversight  of  and  regular  checks  on  the /uni25A0 effectiveness of internal control: a compliance declaration is signed each year by the Chief Executive Officers according to the perimeter defined for each annual campaign.\n\nThis process is outlined in the Internal Control Reference Framework (see Chapter/uni00A06, Section/uni00A02.5.1 - Internal Control Reference Framework) applicable to all Group entities.\n\n## At the level of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain 2.1.3.2\n\nThe Audit and Internal Control Department updates the Group's risk mapping every year. These updates draw on the contributions of the various management levels, and the results are submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nFor the various risks analyzed, the necessary corrective action is taken.\n\n6",

It also promotes the pursuit of added value and enhanced performance, in line with the Group's focus areas and programs (notably in anticipation of the digitalization of company processes).\n\nTherefore, the Audit and Internal Control Department is involved in the Group's compliance program and is primarily responsible for the following:\n\n- designing the Group's internal control and risk /uni25A0 management system;\n- coordinating the implementation of this system, in /uni25A0 liaison with the company's corporate departments and operational management structures. To do this, the Audit and Internal Control Department particularly relies on internal control/risk reference frameworks and the issuing and checking of the compliance statements signed by the general managers for the applicable management levels;\n- carrying out audits in line with the audit plan approved /uni25A0 by the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group Internal Audit Department applies the international standards of the profession as described in the Professional Internal Auditing Standards (RPAI), 2020 version, and thus complies with the Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (CRIPP) of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). The Group's Audit Department was certified in 2020 by the IFACI, the French branch of the/uni00A0IIA.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Audit and Internal Control Department had 78/uni00A0staff, split between audit, internal control and risk management.",

        "page_content": "## The internal control and risk management system 2.3 in the Group entities\n\nEach  entity  is  responsible  for  implementing  an  internal control and risk management system that is appropriate to its needs and aligned with the Group's internal control and risk management system. Each Managing Director is responsible for:\n\n- the relevance and effectiveness of the internal control /uni25A0 system in place within their entity;\n- its compliance with the Group's internal control system; /uni25A0\n- appropriate  management  of  the  risks  faced  by  their /uni25A0 entity.\n\nThis  responsibility  cannot  be  delegated.  Management exercises  this  by  relying  on  the  company's  functional directors, operational staff and the site directors.\n\nTo  build  an  internal  control  system  adapted  to  their activity, the Chief Executive Officers of the companies aim to:\n\n- establish the fundamental bases for internal control and /uni25A0 risk management,  and  in  particular  the  controls described in the Internal Control Reference Framework;\n- adapt the internal control and risk management system /uni25A0 by analyzing specific risks and enhancing the internal control  system  to  include  checks  tailored  to  the management of identified risks;\n- roll  out  the  internal  control  and  risk  management /uni25A0 system on all of the sites;\n- oversee  the  internal  control  and  risk  management /uni25A0 system.\n\n## The procedure for monitoring the internal control 2.4 and risk management system\n\nThe Audit and Internal Control Department monitors the internal control and risk management systems using four main factors:\n\n- compliance statement; /uni25A0\n- internal audits; /uni25A0\n- action plan monitoring; /uni25A0\n- monitoring of fraud and incidents. /uni25A0\n\nThe results of this oversight are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## The compliance statement 2.4.1\n\nThe Managing Directors, for the applicable management levels, report to the Group's General Management on their levels  of  internal  control via an  annual  compliance statement.\n\nThe  form  includes  a  certain  number  of  key  checks extracted from the Internal Control Reference Framework.\n\nThe Managing Director must provide assurances that:\n\n- the controls selected are implemented in a compliant /uni25A0 and efficient manner;\n- the action plans arising from the self-assessment have /uni25A0 been activated and implemented within the given time frames;\n- significant internal control incidents, fraud and breaches /uni25A0 of the Principles of Conduct and Action were reported to the Audit and Internal Control Department or via the Group whistle-blowing system.\n\nThe Managing Directors make a personal commitment to the accuracy of the self-assessment by signing a letter of commitment at the end of the form.\n\nIn  2021,  a  super-validation  was  introduced,  aimed  at obtaining the commitment of the Directors of Clusters, Regions  and  HPS  for  all  declarations  of  compliance belonging to their respective scopes.\n\nThe declarations of compliance and the action plans are gathered, summarized and monitored by the Audit and Internal  Control  Department.  They  are  covered  in  an annual report to the Group's Management team and the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Internal audits 2.4.2\n\nInternal audits are centralized at Compagnie de Saint-Gobain level. The Head of Audit and Internal Control reports to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Internal auditors  located  at  the  Group's  headquarters  or  in  the countries report directly to the Audit and Internal Control Department and work under its authority.\n\nThe audits are scheduled based on long-term, pre-determined  criteria,  in  line  with  a  yearly  audit  plan which is designed taking into account the requirements of the company's General Management, corporate departments and operational departments. The audit plan prepared by the Audit and Internal Control Department is approved by the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nThe aim of the audits is to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Group and  its  subsidiaries  and  to  carry  out  cross-business missions  with  an  operational  benefit.  Generally,  they include an examination of the internal control environment, risk analysis system, internal control organization and procedures and information systems of one or more processes.\n\n6",

The report is then sent to the Group's General Management and the operational department to which the entity reports.\n\n2021 was also marked by the Covid-19 health crisis, which disrupted the normal course of business. However, the audits were maintained in the majority of cases thanks to the launch of a special remote audit work program that adapted the audit system and conducted missions in a new form.\n\n## Action plan monitoring 2.4.3\n\nThe 'INTERACT' integrated audit and internal control tool centralizes:\n\n- actions taken to correct the non-compliance identified /uni25A0 during the annual compliance declaration campaign;\n- the priority action plans defined following the audits /uni25A0 carried out;\n- the main actions defined as part of the annual risk /uni25A0 mapping campaign.\n\nThe INTERACT tool also enables entities to trigger action plans independently, as part of a dynamic management of their internal control.\n\nThis means that each Group company has access to a centralized operational platform it can use to manage its action plans by reporting the corrective measures taken and the progress made compared with the predefined implementation schedule. The corporate departments can also use the system to monitor these action plans.\n\nFurthermore, a dashboard circulated at the Group's different management levels makes it possible to monitor the results of the compliance statements, internal audit grades and the progress of the related action plans.\n\n## Monitoring of fraud and internal 2.4.4 control incidents\n\nFraud and other major internal control incidents are closely monitored by the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Facts to be reported to the Group 2.4.4.1\n\n- Accounting anomalies and alterations which damage /uni25A0 the integrity of the financial information, irrespective of whether they are favorable or unfavorable to the entity or the Group.\n- Misappropriation or jeopardizing of assets, whether /uni25A0 tangible or intangible.\n- Events likely to be construed as acts of passive or /uni25A0 active corruption, or influence peddling.\n- Violations of laws and regulations. /uni25A0\n- Other violations of the Principles of Conduct and /uni25A0 Action.\n\n## Alert procedure 2.4.4.2\n\n## Fraud alert procedure\n\nThe Group's Fraud Officer ensures monitoring by applying a single, centralized procedure which all of the Group's subsidiaries must follow. The facts are reported using a standard form available on the Security Intranet under the fraud section, which describes the facts and the measures taken. The declaration is updated by the entity as necessary. These declarations are then communicated by the Fraud Officer to the relevant management bodies.\n\n## Group whistle-blowing system\n\nThe Group's internal whistle-blowing system makes it possible to collect reports from any employee concerning conduct or situations which are contrary to the Group's Principles of Conduct and Action and the Group's Anti-Corruption policy, offenses or crimes or serious and obvious violations of laws or regulations (for details, see the Saint-Gobain Group Alert System policy). The internal whistle-blowing system is accessible at the following address: https://www.bkms-system.com/Saint-Gobain/fr\n\nWhen the eligibility conditions for the report are met, the reported facts are investigated in a professional and independent manner and the investigations coordinated by duly trained alert referents.\n\n## Whistle-blower protection system\n\nThe whistle-blower is protected under the terms of the Whistle-blowing policy.",

Each ICRF control is referenced against the relevant risk sub-categories. Each process  contains  a  control/risk  matrix  used  to  refer specifically to risk types by control and contributing to understanding the control system.\n\nSection/uni00A03  of  the  Internal  Control  Reference  Framework presents the list of mandatory controls to be implemented by  all  Group  subsidiaries  (250/uni00A0controls  in  the  2021 version).\n\n## The Mini ICRF 2.5.1.2\n\nThis framework has the same structure as the standard ICRF with 17 chapters. It sets out 100/uni00A0controls, which have been carefully selected and developed for small entities. The  Mini  ICRF  also  presents  a  practical  tool  for  the consolidation of newly acquired companies.\n\n## ITACs 2.5.1.3\n\nThe  Automated  Control  Reference  Framework  (ITAC) supplements  the  Group's  Internal  Control  Reference Framework (ICRF) and lists the controls that are wholly or partially  automatable,  the  implementation  of  which  is mandatory. The Group companies are responsible for the implementation  of  this  reference  framework  in  the business applications within their scope ( e.g. SAP) in order to  guarantee  the  perpetuation  of  the  control,  limit  its recurring costs and minimize the risk of human error or fraud.\n\nIn the 2021 edition of the ITAC standard, which covers eight  processes,  there  are  95/uni00A0controls  listed.  They  are divided into three categories: automated process, automated workflow approval and automated reporting (R).\n\nTwo  additional  manuals  were  added  to  the  Group's Internal Control Reference Framework in 2020.\n\n## ICQRF 2.5.1.4\n\nThe ICQRF (Internal Control Quality Reference Framework) manual deals with internal control applied to quality.\n\n## ACRF 2.5.1.5\n\nThe ACRF (Anti-corruption Reference Framework) manual summarizes  the  internal  controls  related  to  the  fight against corruption and influence peddling.\n\nAll of the reference frameworks are available on the IABC (Internal Audit and Business Control) Intranet.\n\nOther tools are also available on the Intranet site to help entities implement the controls (tool box: typical procedures, flow diagrams, library of controls) and best practices.\n\nThe best practices are compiled by:\n\n- the Internal Audit Department - auditors gather best /uni25A0 practices during their audit missions;\n- the  Internal  Control  Department,  using  a  system  of /uni25A0 external  monitoring  (notably  the  Institut  fran\u00e7ais  de l'audit et du contr\u00f4le interne, IFACI);\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The framework describes the EHS management system to be put in place to achieve the EHS objectives and achieve an autonomous and\n\ninterdependent EHS culture. It is based on the principle of continuous improvement. It takes into account:\n\n- international management standards in the three areas /uni25A0 of EHS: ISO/uni00A045001:2018 for health and safety and ISO/uni00A014001:2015 for the environment;\n- the specific requirements of Saint-Gobain, in particular /uni25A0 the Group's EHS standards.\n\nIt is based on the conviction that the implementation of an effective EHS management system in the branches is a necessary condition for the long-term improvement of their EHS performance.\n\nThe framework serves as a reference for the audit of the EHS management systems (ESPR audit on the Distribution scope and the new ISA (Integrated System Assessment) audit launched in 2018 for the industrial scope). A streamlined audit system, called ISA-MINI, which is more suitable for branches whose management system is not ISO-certified, was developed in 2020 and was gradually deployed in 2021. The reflection on Saint-Gobain EHS audits at Distribution sites will be conducted in 2022, using feedback from ISA-MINI audits. The ISA audit was updated at the end of 2021 to take into account the evolution of the EHS standard in 2020.\n\nPrioritization criteria for the definition of ISA and ISA mini audit schedules are proposed to the countries by the EHS team in order to standardize the approaches between the different countries and reduce the burden related to audits. The number of EHS audits in the field was significantly reduced in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nFurthermore, the EHS Department continues to work with its network to develop and update Group EHS standards, which describe the minimum applicable requirements and/or methodologies. These standards help to ensure that risks are assessed and controlled on the same basis in all Group entities, irrespective of the country and the local laws and regulations. Among the documents made available to the sites for the implementation of standards, there are implementation guides, examples of procedures, training kits, questionnaires for assessing the implementation of standards and IT tools. Every year and as needed, certain documents and tools are updated or added. In 2020, an appendix concerning the Work Permit was added to the 'Health and Safety Risk Assessment and Control' standard. A new version of the 'Work-Related Road Risks' standard has been made available, as have updated versions for the guides for the implementation of 'Work Permits', 'Working Alone' and 'Safety Management Audit Tool (SMAT) visits'. A standard on the assessment of environmental risks was disseminated with a guide, and training sessions were conducted. Two guides on risk management in the event of 'isolated work' and when resuming activity to help sites manage the pandemic were also made available. In 2021, the guide on controlling risks linked to 'dangerous energies' (commissioning / de-commissioning) was updated and a guide was created to be referred to during construction projects.\n\nAll of these implementation guides give examples of best practices on how to implement the minimum requirements and can also be used as training materials, thus facilitating the work and increasing the efficiency of the EHS networks of the various countries and businesses.",

This framework is divided into  four  specific  operational  cyber-defense  action plans covering global infrastructure, local infrastructure, applications and websites, and industrial systems.\n\nTechnical standards are also issued as a supplement to these  rules,  and  are  updated  periodically  (25  new documents  in  2021)  to  keep  pace  with  technological advances and control infrastructure services.\n\nThe Information Systems Department has notably defined and rolled out:\n\n- a tool (RMT, Rights Management Tool) for controlling /uni25A0 SAP user rights and managing conflicting segregations of duties. This tool will be gradually integrated into all the Group's SAP systems;\n- a technical standard (SAP4SG) to improve the security /uni25A0 of SAP environments. A tool (SAP4SG) is being rolled out across 47 SAP environments hosted in the IBM (P1) Datacenter to monitor and check the points covered by this standard:\n- the implementation of security patches in the SAP /uni25A0 Production environments,\n\n- the technical configuration of the environments to /uni25A0 improve security,\n- the  monitoring  of  technical  roles,  profiles  and /uni25A0 accounts, as well as high privilege accounts;\n- a technical standard to manage technical and business /uni25A0 accounts  that  access  to  applications  (ATA/ABA, Application  Technical  Accounts/Application  Business Accounts);\n- a Web  Application Secured Development (3.2) /uni25A0 standard (WASD);\n- a technical standard to Secure the Hosting of Internet /uni25A0 Applications (SHIA);\n- a technical standard for SaaS systems which defines /uni25A0 responsibilities and security measures for implementation;\n- a series of security rules for the annual security control /uni25A0 of  the  central  and  regional  datacenters  (Datacenter Security  Rules  4  SG)  and  the  Public  Cloud  Security Rules;\n- a  technical  standard  for  the  security  of  applications /uni25A0 hosted by Saint-Gobain partners for publication on the internet;\n- the methodology for the assessment of Cybersecurity /uni25A0 risks used to assess the measures to be implemented to integrate security into all projects from the first stage, and into contracts with suppliers.\n\nMoreover, the ITAC reference guide was published in 2012. As  an  addition  to  the  Internal Control Reference Framework, which describes the automated and semi-automated  controls  used  for  5  key  processes (Purchasing,  Sales,  Inventory,  Cash  Management  and Accounting), it covers the Group's main ERP software and includes:\n\n- a reference guide for SAP: ITAC4SAP with 143/uni00A0control /uni25A0 points;\n- a  reference  guide  for  MOVEX  M3:  ITAC4M3  with /uni25A0 96/uni00A0control points;\n- a  standard  for  EXACT:  ITAC4EXACT  with  85/uni00A0control /uni25A0 points.\n\nThe  ITAC4SAP  reference  guide  has  been  updated  to ensure  consistency  with  the  updated  Internal  Control Reference Framework (143/uni00A0control points including controls for the segregation of tasks).\n\nThe  controls  are  being  gradually  integrated  into  the Group's information systems as follows:\n\n- ITAC100 ITAC4SAP for SAP systems (deployed in 47 /uni25A0 SAP systems covering 323 Group companies) including specific updates for the Building Distribution activity;\n- ITAC96 ITAC4M3 for MOVEX M3 systems (deployed in /uni25A0 4/uni00A0M3 systems covering 37 Group companies);\n- ITAC85 ITAC4EXACT for EXACT systems (deployed in /uni25A0 1/uni00A0EXACT system covering 24 Group companies);\n- the  main  ITACs  deployed  in  1  MS  Dynamics  system /uni25A0 covering 1 Group company, and the SAP Business One systems, covering 23 companies.\n\n6",

The DRA coordinates the implementation of the policy by the Group's operational entities in its different businesses.\n\nWithin the business and regional entities, Prevention Coordinators manage the application of Group policy within the scope of their activities.\n\nAt site level, those in charge of Prevention Management perform an annual self-assessment of risks at their sites using a risk rating software package. This tool assesses risks as well as the corresponding levels of protection and prevention. This self-assessment is updated annually by the industrial sites, the Research and Development Centers and logistical sites. A special assessment is carried out for the points of sale.\n\nFurthermore, regular inspections of the Group's most important sites are carried out by prevention engineers, who are auditors external to the Group (approximately 350 inspections and 50 remote meetings per year). The sites update their action plans with a view to improving their level of prevention and protection based on recommendations prepared by these prevention engineers.\n\n## Tools of the Group's compliance 2.5.6 culture\n\nThe culture of compliance that drives the Group has developed through its values, which are formally stated in the Principles of Conduct and Action.\n\nThe ethics and compliance program currently focuses on the following main themes: promoting the Principles of Conduct and Action; preventing corruption and influence peddling; compliance with rules relating to competition law; and compliance with economic sanctions and embargos.\n\nThe tools used in implementing the program include:\n\n- a dedicated intranet, called Compliance, on which key /uni25A0 messages are posted and tools made available;\n- online training modules such as Comply (competition /uni25A0 law), ACT (preventing corruption) and Saint-Gobain Economic Sanctions and Embargos (rules relating to economic sanctions and embargos);\n- in-person training; /uni25A0\n- distribution of practical and technical guides: /uni25A0\n- the Thread of Competition, /uni25A0\n- 20 best practices in competition law for purchasers, /uni25A0\n- the Lexia video on the alert system; /uni25A0\n- the dissemination and implementation of internal /uni25A0 policies such as:\n- the policy on the alert system in place at the /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain Group,\n- anti-corruption policy, /uni25A0\n- gifts and invitations policy, /uni25A0\n- conflicts of interest policy, /uni25A0\n- policy on economic sanctions and control of exports, /uni25A0\n- sales agents and intermediaries policy, /uni25A0\n- membership in professional associations policy, /uni25A0\n- the Group policy on management of the corruption /uni25A0 risk by Human Resources,\n- acquisition and joint-venture policies, /uni25A0\n- frequent dissemination of messages by the /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain Group's Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chief Executive Officer and General Secretary and the Chief Executive Officers of the Group's regions, countries and activities;\n- a network of locally-present ethics and compliance /uni25A0 managers and embargo managers.",

This  information  is  prepared  using  the  standards  and principles in force. These are generally accepted principles such  as  the  going  concern  principle,  the  principles  of consistent application of accounting policies, alignment of the opening balance sheet with the prior-period closing balance sheet, recognition of expenses in the same period as  the  income  to  which  they  relate,  segregation  of accounting periods and substance over form.\n\n## Accounting organization 2.6.2\n\nThe  accounting  organization  is  based  on  the  rules, methods and procedures set out in the Group's doctrine memos.  It enables the monthly  reconciliation and substantiation of the accounts and the true and fair view of the events which are represented. The organization also has an advisory role and works upstream to anticipate the accounting impacts of events and the regulatory changes that are likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nThe  chart  of  accounts  is  aligned  with  the  Company's needs  in  terms  of  classification  of  transactions,  and complies with the materiality principle. It is linked to the Group's Financial Information system.\n\n## Internal control 2.6.3\n\nInternal control is based on periodic assessments of the process for preparing accounting and financial information.\n\nIn addition  to  controlling  compliance  with  payment authorization procedures and the double signature rule for secure  payment  means,  the  Accounting  Department contributes to internal control by acting as guarantor in respect of responsibilities defined by General Management and  formalized  through  a  cost  accounting  system organized  by  cost  center.  Specifically, cost center managers receive monthly schedules listing the expenses incurred  under  their  signature,  allowing  them  to  check these expenses  and  also  to  compare  actual  and year-to-date expenses with the initial budget.\n\nA summary of these cost accounting reports is sent to the Finance Department and the Group's General Management at the end of each month.\n\nMeasures are implemented to strengthen the arrangements for managing accounting risks and contributing to the reliability of the financial statements.\n\nFor  this  purpose,  since  2016,  Group  units  have  been subject to a Balance Sheet Review (BSR) procedure under the direction of the Group Financial Control Department, to increase the level of accounting control by the Finance Department of each entity.\n\n## The Group's consolidated financial 2.6.4 statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Group  Consolidation  and  Reporting  Department.  The department is also responsible for updating consolidation procedures, training, and integrating the subsidiaries into the  consolidation  process,  processing  information,  and utilizing, maintaining and developing consolidation systems  and  the  Financial  Information  System  for  the Group and for regions and HPS.\n\n## Group standards 2.6.5\n\nThe Consolidation Department is responsible for providing information  and  periodic  training  to  subsidiaries  in conjunction  with  the  Regions  and  HPS,  using  the consolidation manual, a number of data input manuals, an intranet site and an online training application in French and English. New consolidation instructions are issued for each monthly closing, describing the changes compared with  the  previous  period-end  and  enhancements  to reporting systems, standards and procedures, in collaboration with the Group's Accounting Standards and Pension Liabilities Department.\n\nEach year, the Consolidation Department offers training sessions.\n\n## Processing information and 2.6.6 control of the financial statements\n\nEach subsidiary submits its accounts in accordance with the timetable set by the Company. They are processed and controlled by the Consolidation Department and by each  Region  and  HPS.  The  Consolidation  Department reviews the Group's financial statements as a whole and makes  the  necessary adjustments to prepare the consolidated  financial  statements.  These  consolidated accounts  are  submitted  to  General  Management  every month.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are then examined by the external auditors in accordance with professional Auditing Standards.\n\n## Consolidation tools 2.6.7\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared using consolidation software equipped with a powerful, efficient and  highly  secure  database  aligned  with  the  Group's structure. The software is regularly updated to guarantee the financial information system's sustainability. A tightly controlled access procedure has also been put in place to ensure that the overall system  is secure, and  a comprehensive access review is performed once a year.\n\nThis tool manages a common database that contains the data of all of the Group's consolidated entities.\n\nIt feeds data into a secure reporting system accessible on the Group's Intranet, for the Group's General Management and the Region and HPS Management, contributing to the internal control of information output.\n\n6",

Most recently, on June/uni00A028, 2021, BlackRock,/uni00A0Inc., acting on behalf of customers and funds it manages, disclosed to the French Financial Markets Authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) that on June/uni00A025, 2021, it had exceeded the threshold of 5% of the voting rights of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, holding 5.56% of the share capital and 5.05% of the voting rights on behalf of those customers and funds.\n\nBlackRock,/uni00A0Inc. stated that this crossing of the threshold resulted from the acquisition of Saint-Gobain shares outside and on the market and took into account (i)/uni00A0258 ADRs, (ii)/uni00A0150,498/uni00A0contracts for differences (derivatives with monetary settlement), without established maturity, covering as many Saint-Gobain shares, settled exclusively in cash and (iii)/uni00A01,163,298 Saint-Gobain shares held as collateral.\n\nIn addition, BlackRock,/uni00A0Inc. disclosed that it also holds 3,392,441 Saint-Gobain shares on behalf of customers who have retained the exercise of voting rights.\n\n## Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts 1.5.2 et Consignations\n\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations made several threshold disclosures stating that it had exceeded or dropped below the 5% legal threshold. Most recently, on July/uni00A019, 2021, the Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations disclosed to the French Financial Markets Authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) that it had dropped, on July/uni00A015, 2021, directly and indirectly below the threshold of 5% of the voting rights of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, holding, directly and indirectly through CNP Assurances, which it controls, 4.02% of the share capital and 4.87% of the voting rights.\n\nThe Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations specified that this threshold crossing was the result of the return of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain shares held as collateral by CNP Assurances.\n\n## Statutory disclosure thresholds 1.5.3\n\nIn addition, the Company received several notifications during the year in respect of the obligation set out in the Company's bylaws to disclose any and all changes in interest to above or below 0.5% of the share capital or voting rights, or any multiple thereof. Those disclosure notifications, upwards or downwards, were received following the sale of shares or changes in Compagnie de Saint-Gobain's shares and voting rights.\n\n## Employee ownership structure 1.6\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, Group employees held 8.3% of the share capital and 14.9% of the voting rights attached to Compagnie Saint-Gobain shares through the Group Savings Plan Funds. The Group Savings Plan Funds are thus the Group's main shareholder.\n\nThe Group Savings Plan ( Plan d'\u00c9pargne Groupe , PEG) is a key feature of Saint-Gobain's social contract. It represents an excellent means of giving employees a stake in the Group's success and profits.\n\nIn 2021, 5,562,855/uni00A0shares were issued under the PEG offering Group employees two classic formulae with a fiveor ten-year lock-up, for a total of \u20ac199.2/uni00A0million\n\n(compared with 6,099,996/uni00A0shares and \u20ac140.5/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\nIn France, 67.1% of employees invested in the PEG through a corporate mutual fund ( fond commun de placement d'entreprise , FCPE). Employees in 27 other European countries and 20/uni00A0countries outside Europe were also given the opportunity to take part in the PEG. In total, 47,768 Group employees participated in the PEG in 2021.\n\nA new plan will be launched in 2022. It will give employees the opportunity to acquire up to 6,500,000/uni00A0shares, i.e. just over 1% of the share capital, with a five- or ten-year lock-up.",

The total potential cost was USD 176/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n7",

At December/uni00A031, 2021, 77,516/uni00A0securities were outstanding with an aggregate face value of \u20ac77.5/uni00A0million.\n\nInterest on these non-voting participating securities comprises a fixed portion of 7.5% paid per year applicable to 60% of the nominal amount of the security, and a variable portion applicable to the remaining 40% of the nominal amount of the participating security, which is linked to consolidated net profit (loss) for the previous year and to the reference six-month Libor EUR rate +7/8%. The amount paid per security in 2021 was \u20ac61.3, paid in two installments (\u20ac27.95 and \u20ac33.35).\n\nIn accordance with the decisions approved by the General Meeting of the holders of those non-voting participating securities on November/uni00A019, 2020 and in the context of the end of the publication of the LIBOR rates as of December/uni00A031, 2021, the EUR 6-month LIBOR reference rate of +7/8% per annum used for the calculation of the variable portion of the compensation of the security is replaced, as from the date of the opening of the period of compensation i.e. February/uni00A011, 2021, by the 6-month EURIBOR rate of +7/8% per annum .\n\n7",

Its director is Vivien Dardel.\n\nThis  Department  is  available  to  answer  questions  and address requests for information about the Group:\n\nSaint-Gobain\n\nInvestor Relations Department\n\nTour Saint-Gobain\n\n12, place de l'Iris\n\n92400 Courbevoie cedex\n\nTel: +33 1 88 54 05 05 - Fax: +33 1 47 62 50 62\n\nTOLL-FREE NUMBER 0,800 32 33 33\n\nDuring  2021,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Chief Financial Officer met quarterly with the financial community to present the Group's performance, during conference  calls  or  meetings  broadcast  live  on  the Company's website. In addition to the quarterly meetings, numerous  meetings  and  roadshows  were  organized virtually - given the coronavirus pandemic - with financial analysts,  institutional  investors  and  journalists.  Specific meetings and conferences dedicated to ESG (Environment,  Social  and  Governance)  issues  were  also organized, with the participation of the Vice President for Sustainable  Development  and  the  Lead  independent Director.\n\n2021  was  marked  by  the  organization  of  the  Capital Markets Day, a major event for the financial community, which  was  held  on  October  6,  2021  in  person  at  the Saint-Gobain Tower, with live broadcasting of the entire event  via  an  immersive  platform.  This  event  was  an opportunity  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the management team to present the Group's new strategic plan for the period 2021-2025, the Grow & Impact plan, and to answer questions from the financial community. Those who were able to attend the event in person were able  to  take  part  in  guided  tours  of  the  Saint-Gobain Tower to discover more than 80 Group solutions used in the Tower.\n\nThe year was also marked by the announcement of two key acquisitions for the Group - Chryso and GCP - which provided  an  opportunity  to  present  two  decisive  steps that establish Saint-Gobain as a world leader in construction chemicals and reinforce the Group's strategy as a world leader in sustainable construction. Conference calls with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Executive Officer of Chryso were held on the day  of  the  announcement  of  these transactions, along with question and answer sessions.\n\nIn the context of the coronavirus pandemic and the fight against  its  spread,  and  in  order  to  protect  everyone's health, the Board of Directors has decided to hold the Shareholders' Meeting in closed session on June 3, 2021, as it did for the June 2020 General Shareholders' Meeting. Shareholders were invited to exercise their voting rights prior to the General Meeting. The Group has ensured that the necessary resources are in place to facilitate remote participation by shareholders, with a full live webcast on the Saint-Gobain website and the possibility for shareholders  to  ask  questions  live  via  the  webcast platform.\n\nThe Group also favored a policy of virtual exchanges with individual shareholders for site visits, meetings and cultural conferences, given the uncertain health environment. The Chief Executive Officer participated in the 'Investir Day' event held on November 23, 2021 in a hybrid format (in person and online broadcast).\n\nIn addition to the virtual events organized throughout the year,  the  Investor  Relations  Department  kept  individual shareholders regularly informed of the Group's many news items via its website, the Saint-Gobain Shareholder app and the Letter to Shareholders.\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Shareholder app allows shareholders to follow the Group's financial news and find essential and useful information (share price, financial calendar, press releases,  etc.).  Finally,  the  Letter  to  Shareholders,  sent twice  a  year  to  Group  shareholders  in  March  and September,  highlights  the  Group's  financial  results  and strategic priorities.\n\nIn order  to  ensure  privileged  contact,  the  Investor Relations team can be contacted by email at the following address:\n\nactionnaires@Saint-Gobain.com\n\nCompagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  also makes  additional services available to holders of registered shares through BNP Paribas, to improve the management of their fully registered  shares.

They are expressed in euros rounded to the nearest million.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were adopted on February/uni00A024, 2022 by the Board of Directors and will be submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A02, 2022 for approval.\n\nAccounting principles and policies are highlighted in a distinct color.\n\n## Accounting principles and policies NOTE 1\n\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those used to prepare the financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, except for the application of the new standards and interpretations described below. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities that have been measured using the fair value model as explained in these notes.\n\n## Standards applied 1.1\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations adopted for use in the European Union at December/uni00A031, 2021.

        "page_content": "## Estimates and assumptions 1.2\n\nThe  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in compliance  with  IFRS  requires  management  to  make estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  of assets and liabilities reported in the balance sheet and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to  the  financial  statements,  as  well  as  the  reported amounts of income and expenses during the period. These estimates and assumptions are based on past experience and on various other factors in the prevailing economic and  financial  environment  which  makes  it  difficult  to predict future business performance. Actual amounts may differ  from  those  obtained  through  the  use  of  these estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe main estimates and assumptions described in these notes  concern  the  measurement  of  employee  benefit obligations and share-based payment (note/uni00A06 'Employees, personnel expenses and employee benefit obligations'), asset impairment tests (notably the assumptions used in the tests relating to the Group's commitments to reduce\n\nits net carbon emissions) and the determination of lease terms  (note/uni00A07/uni00A0'Intangible assets, property,  plant  and equipment, and right-of-use assets'), provisions for other liabilities and charges (note/uni00A09/uni00A0'Other current and non-current liabilities and provisions, contingent liabilities and litigation'), the measurement of financial instruments (note/uni00A010 'Financing and financial instruments'), and taxes (note/uni00A012 'Tax').\n\nDue to the mainly local nature of the Group's operations, Brexit  did  not  have  a  direct  material  impact  on  the financial statements. However, it does give rise to a degree of macroeconomic uncertainty that could affect business in  the  United  Kingdom  and,  therefore,  Group  entities operating in the country.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the estimates and assumptions used in 2021 take into account uncertainties as to the development of the health situation going forward. However, these are expected to have a limited impact on the Group's businesses.\n\n## Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic NOTE 2\n\nAfter being severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020, trading in the second half of 2020 was almost back to normal levels for most of the Group's businesses.\n\nIn a  macroeconomic  and  health  environment  which remains affected by uncertainties, the Group delivered a solid operating performance throughout 2021 and enjoyed good momentum  in  its main markets, especially renovation  in  Europe  and  construction  in  the  Americas and in Asia-Pacific.\n\nThese  trends  may  change  in  the  coming  months depending on how the coronavirus pandemic evolves in terms  of  duration  and  magnitude,  vaccination  progress and  available  medical  treatment,  and  the  resulting consequences  for  the  Group's  partners  (customers, suppliers, etc.).\n\n## Impact on current operating items\n\nAs in 2020, the costs of the measures taken in response to the Covid-19 crisis were included in full within operating income. However, these costs were not material in 2021.\n\nOperating  income  includes,  as  in  2020,  business  travel cost savings resulting from the reduction in, or cancellation of, business trips in most countries where the Group does business.\n\n## Impairment review in light of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nNo  impairment  was  recognized  in  connection  with  the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 (see note/uni00A07.5.2).\n\n8",

        "page_content": "## Climate issues NOTE 3\n\nGiven its activities in the renovation market, sustainability is essential in supporting the growth of the Saint-Gobain Group. Sustainability issues are therefore an integral part of the Group's growth outlook, in line with issues relating to the energy transition.\n\nResponding to climate challenges is therefore at the heart of the Group's strategy, and its net-zero-carbon commitment is taken into account in its financial decisions.\n\n## The commitment to carbon 3.1 neutrality is at the heart of the Group's strategy\n\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, Saint-Gobain signed the pledge of the UN Global Compact's 'Business ambition for 1.5\u00b0C' on September/uni00A023, 2019 in New York, thereby affirming its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality (net-zero-carbon emissions) by 2050.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal by 2050, Saint-Gobain defined a 2030 roadmap in 2020. Besides confirming targets for reducing its environmental footprint by the end of 2025, the roadmap aims for a 33% reduction in CO2 emissions in absolute terms compared with 2017 for scopes/uni00A01 and 2, and a 16% reduction for scope/uni00A03.\n\nThese new reduction targets through to 2030 reflect an acceleration in Group's ambitions. Its commitment to carbon neutrality places its response to climate change at the heart of its strategy, alongside its range of solutions enabling customers to address the environmental challenges that they face.\n\n## The commitment to carbon 3.2 neutrality is taken into account when preparing the Group's financial statements\n\nIn line with these commitments and targets, the Group has taken into account climate change and sustainable development issues in its financial statements, mainly in the areas cited below.\n\n## Basis of measurement applicable to assets\n\nThe Group's commitments to carbon neutrality were taken into account when carrying out asset impairment tests and assessing the useful life of its non-current assets (see notes/uni00A07.3 and 7.5).\n\n## CO2 emissions allowances\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group was allocated 3.7/uni00A0million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions allowances by the European Commission at the end of 2021. These allowances will cover the Group's actual CO2 emissions for 2021. As a result, no provision was recorded in this respect in the Group's financial statements (see note/uni00A05.5.4).\n\n## Sustainable investments, research and development expenditure, and other expenditure aimed at combating climate change and protecting the environment\n\nIn 2021, the Group set aside \u20ac55/uni00A0million in capital expenditure and \u20ac44/uni00A0million in research and development expenditure to further its environmental CO2 emissions reduction strategy.\n\n## Executive Compensation policy\n\nIn stepping up its commitment to carbon neutrality, the Group increased since 2020 the weighting of CSR objectives in the criteria determining long-term executive compensation plans: CSR objectives now determine 20% of amounts paid out under such plans compared to 15% previously, while CO2 objectives now account for 10% versus 5% previously (see note/uni00A06.2).\n\nThe consideration of climate change issues did not have a material impact on the judgments made or the key estimates required to prepare the financial statements.\n\nThe Group will continue to analyze the potential impacts of future changes in regulations related to climate change and the energy transition as part of its commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.",

        "page_content": "## Scope of consolidation NOTE 4\n\n## Accounting principles related 4.1 to consolidation\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements include the accounts  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  and  of  all companies controlled by the Group, as well as those of jointly controlled companies and companies over which the Group exercises significant influence.\n\n## Consolidation methods 4.1.1\n\n## Full consolidation\n\nCompanies  over  which  the  Group  exercises  exclusive control, either directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated.\n\n## Joint arrangements\n\nJoint  arrangements  that  meet  the  definition  of  joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method. Balance sheet  and  income  statement  items  relating  to  joint arrangements that meet the definition of joint operations are consolidated line-by-line based on the amount actually contributed by the Group.\n\n## Equity accounting\n\nCompanies  over  which  the  Group  directly  or  indirectly exercises significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nThe  Group's  share  of  the  income  of  equity-accounted companies is shown on two separate lines of the income statement.  The  income  of  equity-accounted  companies whose  main  business  activity  is  in  keeping  with  the Group's core operational business is presented in business income  under  'Share  in  net  income  of  core  business equity-accounted companies', while the income of other equity-accounted companies is shown under 'Share in net income of non-core business equity-accounted companies' in pre-tax income.\n\n## Business combinations 4.1.2\n\n## Step acquisitions and partial disposals\n\nWhen the Group acquires control of an entity in which it already holds an equity interest, the transaction is treated as a step acquisition (an acquisition in stages), as follows: (i)/uni00A0as a disposal of all the previously-held interest, with recognition of any resulting gain or loss in the consolidated financial statements, and (ii)/uni00A0as an acquisition of all of the shares, with recognition of the corresponding goodwill  on  the  entire  interest  (previous  and  new acquisitions).\n\nIn the event of a partial disposal resulting in the loss of control (but with the Group retaining a non-controlling interest), the transaction is also treated as both a disposal and an acquisition, as follows: (i)/uni00A0as a disposal of the entire interest, with recognition of any resulting gain or loss in the  consolidated  financial  statements,  and  (ii)/uni00A0as  an acquisition of a non-controlling interest, measured at fair value.\n\n## Potential voting rights and share purchase commitments\n\nPotential  voting  rights  conferred  by  call  options  on minority interests are taken into account in determining whether  the  Group  exclusively  controls  an  entity  only when the Group has control.\n\nWhen  calculating  its  percentage  interest  in  controlled companies, the Group considers the impact of cross put and call options on minority interests in the companies concerned. This approach gives rise to the recognition in the financial statements of an investment-related liability, included within other provisions and non-current liabilities, corresponding  to  the  present  value  of  the  estimated exercise  price  of  the  put  option,  with  a  corresponding reduction  in  non-controlling  interests  and  shareholders' equity. Any subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized by adjusting equity.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nUnder IFRS/uni00A010, non-controlling interests are considered as a shareholder category (single economic entity approach). As a result, changes in minority interests with no loss of control  continue  to  be  recorded  in  the  statement  of changes  in  equity  and  have  no  impact  on  the  income statement or balance sheet, except for changes in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Non-current assets and liabilities held 4.1.3 for sale - Discontinued operations\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  that  are  immediately  available  for sale, and for which a sale is highly probable within the next 12/uni00A0months, are classified as non-current  assets  and liabilities held for sale. When several assets are held for sale in a single transaction, they are accounted for as a disposal group, which also includes any liabilities directly associated  with  those  assets.  The  assets  or  disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation/amortization ceases when non-current assets are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale are presented separately on two lines of the consolidated balance sheet, and income and expenses continue to be recognized in the consolidated income statement on a line-by-line basis. The reclassified assets are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to  sell  and  their  carrying  amount.  At  the  end  of  each reporting period, the value of the assets and liabilities held for sale is reviewed to determine whether any provision adjustments should be recorded due to a change in their fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAn  operation  is  classified  as  discontinued  when  it represents a separate major line of business for the Group, and when the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale have been met, or when the Group has sold the asset. Discontinued operations are reported on a single line in the  Group's  income  statement.  This  line  shows  the after-tax net income from discontinued operations until the date of disposal and the gains or losses net of taxes realized on the disposals of these operations. In addition, cash flows generated by the discontinued operations are reported, by type of operation, on a separate line in the consolidated  statement  of  cash  flows  for  the  relevant periods.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "2021 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Intragroup transactions 4.1.4\n\nAll intragroup transactions in the balance sheet and income statement are eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Translation of the financial statements of 4.1.5 foreign companies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is Compagnie de Saint-Gobain's functional and presentation currency.\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the Eurozone are translated into euros at the closing exchange rate, while income and expense items are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.\n\nThe Group's share of any translation gains or losses is included in equity under 'Cumulative translation adjustments' until the assets or liabilities and all foreign operations to which they relate are sold, liquidated or deconsolidated. In this case, these translation differences are either taken to the income statement, if the transaction results in a loss of control, or recognized directly in the statement of changes in equity, if the change in minority interests does not result in a loss of control.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions 4.1.6\n\nExpenses and income from operations in currencies other than the Company's functional currency are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate and any exchange differences are recorded in the income statement. However, exchange differences relating to loans and borrowings between consolidated Group companies are recorded in equity, net of tax, under 'Cumulative translation adjustments', as they are in substance an integral part of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary.\n\n## Hyperinflation 4.1.7\n\nUnder IAS/uni00A029, 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies', financial statements prepared based on historical cost must be restated. This involves applying a general price index that enables the financial statements to be presented in the measuring unit in force at the reporting date. All non-monetary assets and liabilities must therefore be adjusted for inflation in order to reflect changes in purchasing power at the reporting date. Similarly, the income statement is adjusted for inflation during the period. Monetary items do not need to be restated as they already reflect purchasing power at the reporting date.\n\n## 4.1.7.1 Argentina\n\nArgentina has been classified as a hyperinflationary economy since July/uni00A01, 2018. IAS/uni00A029 therefore applies to entities using the Argentine peso as their functional currency (based on the table of indices issued by FACPCE).\n\n## 4.1.7.2 Lebanon\n\nLebanon has been classified as a hyperinflationary economy since October/uni00A02020. As from December/uni00A031, 2020, IAS/uni00A029 is therefore applicable to entities using the Lebanese pound as their functional currency.\n\nHowever, as the Group's exposure to Lebanon is not material (sales in the country represent less than 1% of total Group sales), IAS/uni00A029 was not applied to the Group's Lebanese companies in 2021.\n\n## Changes in Group structure 4.2\n\nSignificant changes in the Group's structure during 2021 and 2020 are presented below and a list of the main consolidated companies at December/uni00A031, 2021 is provided in note/uni00A015 'Principal consolidated companies'.\n\n## Transactions carried out in 2021 4.2.1\n\nIn 2021, Saint-Gobain acquired 31 consolidated companies for a total purchase price of \u20ac985/uni00A0million. The Group also sold 12 consolidated companies for a sale price of \u20ac187/uni00A0million.\n\n## 4.2.1.1 Main acquisitions in 2021\n\nAcquisitions in 2021 represent full-year sales of around \u20ac816/uni00A0million and \u20ac123/uni00A0million in Ebitda.\n\n- On February/uni00A019, 2021, in accordance with the /uni25A0 agreement to strengthen its partnership with El Volcan in Argentina and Peru, Saint-Gobain acquired El Volcan Soluciones Constructivas, which specializes in the production and sale of plasterboard in Peru.\n- On March/uni00A015, 2021, Saint-Gobain announced that it had /uni25A0 acquired a majority stake in Br\u00fcggemann, one of Germany's leading companies in the manufacture and installation of turnkey modular timber construction solutions for new construction and renovation in Germany.\n- On July/uni00A015, 2021, Saint-Gobain completed the /uni25A0 acquisition of Russia's Scientific and Production Company Adhesive/uni00A0LLC, a specialist company that controls the entire polyurethane and epoxy production cycle in order to develop, manufacture and supply a wide range of high-quality products for the construction, transportation and aerospace markets.\n- On September/uni00A01, 2021, Saint-Gobain acquired /uni25A0 Netherlands-based Equflow/uni00A0BV, a leading designer and supplier of flowmeters for the single-use bioprocessing market. This acquisition expands the Group's range of single-use fluid management solutions.\n- On September/uni00A029, 2021, in line with its May/uni00A020, 2021 /uni25A0 announcement, Saint-Gobain announced that it had completed the acquisition of Chryso, a leading global player on the construction chemicals market thanks to its comprehensive additives solutions for sustainable construction. This acquisition, perfectly in line with Saint-Gobain's strategy to position itself as a world leader in sustainable construction, allows the Group to strengthen its presence on the growing construction chemicals market, while benefiting from cost and sales synergies. With an enterprise value of \u20ac1,020/uni00A0million, the acquisition was financed entirely out of proceeds from the Group's disposals.\n\nThe acquisition of Chryso represents pro forma full-year sales of \u20ac431/uni00A0million and \u20ac87/uni00A0million in Ebitda for 2021.\n\nThe process of identifying and measuring the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value began in the second half of 2021 and will be completed in 2022.\n\n- On September/uni00A030, 2021, Saint-Gobain completed the /uni25A0 acquisition of Romanian group Duraziv specializing in the production of adhesives and other value-added construction chemicals solutions.\n- On September/uni00A030, 2021, in line with its May/uni00A011, 2021 /uni25A0 announcement, Saint-Gobain completed the acquisition of the French company Panofrance, a specialist distributor of timber and panels for the construction and furnishing industries.",

Revenue generated by the sale of goods is primarily recognized at the time the goods are delivered. Revenue generated by the sale of services is recognized when the services have been rendered, or based on the stage of completion of the services, as calculated based on costs incurred. Similarly, within the Distribution entities, estimated returns are recognized as a deduction from revenue (sales) and reclassified within inventories for their net carrying amount, since there is a possibility that goods will be returned within the allotted timeframe. A liability relating to future refunds for goods returned is also recognized.\n\nRevenue generated under construction contracts is accounted for by the Group's companies on a percentage-of-completion basis, as calculated based on costs incurred. The related costs are expensed as incurred. When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognized to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recovered. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognized as an expense immediately.\n\nConstruction contract revenues are not material in relation to total consolidated sales.\n\n## Operating income 5.1.2\n\nOperating income is a measure of the performance of the Group's different reporting segments and has been used by the Group as its key external and internal management indicator for many years. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in operating income, as are changes in the fair value of financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting when they relate to operating items. The share of income of core business equity-accounted companies is also posted under operating income.\n\nSupplier discounts granted to entities in the Distribution business are included in operating income as a reduction of cost of sales. Contractual supplier discounts are customary practice in the industrial goods distribution sector. These discounts are mostly calculated by applying a contractually guaranteed rate by product type to volumes purchased. The calculation is made automatically, based on the supplier invoices. Consequently, little judgment is needed when determining the amounts to be recognized in the income statement for these discounts. Other discounts are calculated based on a step mechanism linked to specified targets, whereby the percentage discount increases as the entity achieves the\n\nvarious targets over a given period. In this case, judgment is required based on historical data, past performance and future trends in order to determine the discount to be recognized in the income statement. Such judgment is exercised in a prudent manner and consistently from one period to the next.\n\n## 5.1.3 Business income\n\nBusiness income includes all income and expenses other than financial income and expense, the Group's share in net income of non-core business equity-accounted companies, and income taxes.\n\nBusiness income is detailed by type below:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                                                                             | 2021     | 2020     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| SALES                                                                                                         | 44,160   | 38,128   |\n| Personnel expenses:                                                                                           |          |          |\n| Salaries and payroll taxes (1)                                                                                | (8,296)  | (7,625)  |\n| Share-based payments (2)                                                                                      | (76)     | (45)     |\n| Pensions and employee benefit obligations (2)                                                                 | (249)    | (222)    |\n| Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets (3) | (1,934)  | (1,902)  |\n| Share in net income of core business equity-accounted companies                                               | 52       | 13       |\n| Other (4)                                                                                                     | (29,150) | (25,492) |\n| OPERATING INCOME                                                                                              | 4,507    | 2,855    |\n| Other business income                                                                                         | 176      | 88       |\n| Other business expense (3)                                                                                    | (747)    | (1,511)  |\n| OTHER BUSINESS INCOME AND EXPENSE                                                                             | (571)    | (1,423)  |\n| BUSINESS INCOME (EXPENSE)                                                                                     | 3,936    | 1,432    |",

The cost of inventories includes purchase costs (net of supplier discounts), processing costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is generally determined using the weighted-average cost method, and in some cases the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method. Inventory costs may also include the transfer from equity of any gains/losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of raw materials. Net realizable value is the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated completion and selling costs. No account is taken in the inventory valuation process of the impact of below-normal capacity utilization rates.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021 and 2020, inventories were as follows:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                      | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Gross value                            |                 |                 |\n| Raw materials                          | 1,726           | 1,368           |\n| Work in progress                       | 367             | 308             |\n| Finished goods                         | 5,033           | 4,170           |\n| GROSS/uni00A0INVENTORIES               | 7,126           | 5,846           |\n| Provisions for impairment              |                 |                 |\n| Raw materials                          | (191)           | (175)           |\n| Work in progress                       | (16)            | (15)            |\n| Finished goods                         | (321)           | (294)           |\n| TOTAL PROVISIONS FOR/uni00A0IMPAIRMENT | (528)           | (484)           |\n| INVENTORIES, NET                       | 6,598           | 5,362           |\n\nThe net value of inventories is \u20ac6,598/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021 compared to \u20ac5,362/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020. Impairment losses on inventories recorded in the 2021 income statement totaled \u20ac279/uni00A0million (2020:/uni00A0\u20ac222/uni00A0million). Reversals of impairment losses on inventories amounted to \u20ac219/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: \u20ac175/uni00A0million).\n\n## Operating and non-operating receivables 5.4.2 and payables\n\nTrade accounts receivable and payable and other receivables and payables are stated at their carrying amount, which approximates their fair value as they generally have maturities of less than three months. Provisions for impairment are booked to cover the risk of total or partial non-recovery, within the limit of expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group deems that its exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to its diversified business line-up, broad customer base and global presence. Past-due trade receivables are regularly monitored and analyzed, and impairment losses recognized are adjusted where appropriate.\n\nThe Group has various securitization and factoring programs for its trade receivables. Receivables transferred under some of these programs continue to be shown on the balance sheet with a corresponding liability in short-term debt if, based on an analysis of the contracts, the risks associated with the receivables are not transferred in substance to the financing institutions (further information is provided in notes/uni00A010.3.8 and 10.3.10).\n\n## Trade and other accounts receivable\n\nTrade and other accounts receivable can be analyzed as follows:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                           | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Gross value                                                 | 5,449           | 4,959           |\n| Provisions for impairment                                   | (345)           | (362)           |\n| TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET                              | 5,104           | 4,597           |\n| Discounts obtained from and advances granted to suppliers   | 636             | 566             |\n| Prepaid payroll taxes                                       | 35              | 36              |\n| Other prepaid and recoverable taxes (other than income tax) | 470             | 350             |\n| Miscellaneous operating receivables                         | 289             | 260             |\n| Other non-operating receivables                             | 81              | 64              |\n| Provision for impairment of other receivables               | (7)             | (7)             |\n| OTHER RECEIVABLES, NET                                      | 1,504           | 1,269           |\n\nThe increase in trade and other accounts receivable at December/uni00A031, 2021 is a result of the strong level of business in the year.\n\nThe impact of movements in provisions and bad debt write-offs fell to a negative \u20ac55/uni00A0million at end-2021 versus a negative \u20ac95/uni00A0million at end-2020.\n\nBad debt write-offs remained stable at \u20ac78/uni00A0million compared to \u20ac76/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n8",

The decrease in this item reflects changes during the year as well as the transfer of obligations to a third-party insurer falling within the scope of Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0137-11 of the French Social Security Code, as taken up in the PACTE Law.\n\n## Provisions for pensions and other 6.3 employee benefits\n\n## Description of defined benefit plans 6.3.1\n\nAfter retirement, some of the Group's former employees are eligible for pension benefits in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations in the respective countries in which the Group operates. There are also additional pension obligations in certain Group companies, both in France and in other countries.\n\nThe Group's obligation for the payment of pensions and length-of-service awards is determined at the end of the reporting period by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method (taking into account changes in salaries until retirement) and the economic conditions in each country. This obligation may be financed by pension funds, with a provision recognized in the balance sheet for the unfunded portion.\n\nWhen plan assets exceed the defined benefit obligation, the excess is recognized in other non-current assets under 'Net pension assets'. The asset ceiling corresponds to the maximum future economic benefit. Changes in the asset ceiling are recognized in equity.\n\nActuarial gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions, experience adjustments and the difference between the funds' actual and estimated (calculated) rates of return. They are recognized against equity as and when they arise.\n\nThe interest cost of these obligations and the return on the related plan assets are measured by the Group using the discount rate applied to estimate the obligation at the beginning of the period, and are recognized as financial income or expense.\n\nThe Group's main defined benefit plans are described below.\n\nIn France, employees receive length-of-service awards on retirement based on years of service and the calculation methods prescribed in the applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nIn addition to length-of-service awards, there are three defined benefit plans, all of which are final salary plans. These plans were closed to new entrants by the companies concerned between 1969 and 1997. Effective March/uni00A01, 2012, a defined benefit plan complying with Article/uni00A0L.137-11 of France's Social Security Code ( Code de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale ) was set up by Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. Pursuant to an order of July/uni00A04, 2019 issued in the wake of France's PACTE Law setting out an action plan for business growth and transformation, this plan was closed and any vested rights frozen at December/uni00A031, 2019. In 2021, two new plans were set up pursuant to Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0137-11-2 resulting from the PACTE Law, effective January/uni00A01, 2020. Under these plans, final payments are made to a third-party insurer who takes on responsibility for the liability.\n\nIn 2021, the Group applied the IFRIC agenda decision, 'Attributing Benefit to Periods of Service', which changes the method for calculating obligations under certain defined benefit plans. Since the impact of applying this agenda decision was not material at January/uni00A01, 2021, the 2020 financial statements have not been restated.",

Since January/uni00A01997, new employees have been offered pension plans based on contributions financed jointly by employer and employee.\n\nOn January/uni00A01, 2019, the main pension plan in the Netherlands covering 80% of employees was converted into a defined contribution plan with a residual defined benefit plan for a transitional period of up to 12/uni00A0years.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, retirement plans provide pensions as well as death and permanent disability benefits. These defined benefit plans -/uni00A0which are based on employees' average salaries over their final years of employment/uni00A0have been closed to new entrants since 2001./uni00A0The legal structure of the plans is being altered, which will include the closure of the Building Distribution Section to future accrual from January/uni00A01, 2022.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the Group's defined benefit plans are final-salary plans. Since January/uni00A01, 2001, new employees have been offered a defined contribution plan.\n\nIn the United States and Spain, retired employees receive benefits other than pensions, mainly concerning healthcare. The Group's obligation under these plans is\n\n2021 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\ndetermined using the actuarial method and is covered by a provision recorded in the balance sheet.\n\nProvisions for other long-term employee benefits cover all other employee benefits. These benefits primarily include long-service awards in France, jubilee awards in Germany, deferred compensation, provisions for social security benefits in the United States, and termination benefits in different countries. The related defined benefit obligation is generally calculated on an actuarial basis using the same rules as for pension obligations. Actuarial gains and losses relating to these benefits are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions used to measure 6.3.2 defined benefit obligations and plan assets\n\n## 6.3.2.1 Interest rate assumptions\n\nAssumptions related to mortality, employee turnover and future salary increases take into account the economic conditions specific to each country and Group company. The discount rates are established by region or country based on observed bond rates at December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nFor the Eurozone, two discount rates were calculated based on the term of the plans using a yield curve model developed by consulting firm Mercer: one rate for plans with a term of 14/uni00A0years or less and one for plans with a term of over 14/uni00A0years.\n\nThe rates used in 2021 for the Group's main plans were the following:\n\n|                  | France           | France          | Eurozone         | Eurozone        | United Kingdom   | United States   |\n|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| (in %)           | Short-term plans | Long-term plans | Short-term plans | Long-term plans |                  |                 |\n| Discount rate    | 1.06%            | 1.42%           | 1.06%            | 1.42%           | 1.95%            | 2.70%           |\n| Salary increases | 1,90% to 5.50%   |                 | 2.10% to 2.30%   |                 | 2.00%*           | 3.00%           |\n| Inflation rate   | 1.70%            |                 | 1.60% to 2.00%   |                 | 2.70%            | 2.20%           |\n\nThe rates used in 2020 for the Group's main plans were the following:\n\n|                  | France           | France          | Eurozone         | Eurozone        | United Kingdom   | United States   |    |\n|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|----|\n| (in %)           | Short-term plans | Long-term plans | Short-term plans | Long-term plans |                  |                 |    |\n| Discount rate    | 0.70%            | 1.11%           | 0.70%            | 1.11%           | 1.20%            | 2.30%           |    |\n| Salary increases | 3.10%            |                 | 1.20% to 2.30%   |                 | 2.00%*           | 3.00%           |    |\n| Inflation rate   | 1.50%            |                 | 0.90% to 1.60%   |                 | 2.15%            | 2.20%           |    |\n\nAs the above three regions account for substantially all of the Group's pension obligation, the revised actuarial assumptions, notably the discount and inflation rates, contributed to a decrease in the obligation, and therefore in the provision, by an amount of \u20ac597/uni00A0million.\n\nThe actual return on plan assets for almost all plans was higher than expected, at \u20ac222/uni00A0million, leading to a decrease in the provision of the same amount.\n\n8",

A 0.5-point increase in the inflation rate would lead to an overall increase in defined benefit obligations of around \u20ac560/uni00A0million.\n\nThe same assumptions concerning mortality, employee turnover and interest rates are used to determine the Group's defined benefit obligations for other long-term employee benefits. In the United States, retirees' healthcare costs are projected to rise between 4.00% and 5.63% per year (under 65/uni00A0years of age), and between 2.80% and 6.56% per year (older than 65), depending on the age of the beneficiary.

Eligible employees must have completed a minimum of three months' service with the Group. Eligible employees are able to invest in Saint-Gobain shares at a preferential subscription price. These shares are held either directly or through the employee saving plan's mutual funds, depending on local legislation, and are subject to a mandatory five- or ten-year lock-up, except following the occurrence of certain events. The Board of Directors delegates authorization for setting the subscription price to the Chief executive officer of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. The subscription price corresponds to the average of the opening prices for the Saint-Gobain share on Euronext Paris over the 20/uni00A0trading days preceding the date of the decision, subject to a 20% discount, in accordance with applicable laws, the Shareholders' Meeting Resolutions and the deliberations of the Board of Directors. The Group makes a matching contribution to amounts paid in by employees, which is expensed in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe IFRS/uni00A02 expense measuring the benefit granted to employees is calculated in accordance with CNC recommendations (press release dated December/uni00A021, 2004 relating to Group Savings Plans, and additional press release dated February/uni00A07, 2007). It is measured by reference to the fair value of a discount offered on restricted stock ( i.e. , stock subject to a lock-up). The cost of the lock-up for the employee is defined as the cost of a two-step strategy that involves first selling the restricted stock forward five or ten years and then purchasing the same number of shares on the spot market and financing the purchase with debt. The borrowing cost is estimated at the rate that would be charged by a bank to an individual with an average risk profile for a general-purpose fiveor ten-year consumer loan repayable at maturity. The cost of the plans is recognized in full at the end of the subscription period.\n\nIn 2021, Saint-Gobain implemented a new PEG. The terms of the 2021 PEG are identical to the 2020 PEG and are described below.\n\nIn 2021, 5,562,855 new shares with a par value of \u20ac4 were issued to employees under the PEG at an average subscription price of \u20ac35.81 (6,099,996/uni00A0shares at an average price of \u20ac23.03 in 2020), representing a share capital increase of \u20ac199/uni00A0million (\u20ac139/uni00A0million in 2020), net of transaction fees.\n\nThe IFRS/uni00A02 expense relating to this plan recorded in the 2021 income statement amounted to \u20ac13.2/uni00A0million (\u20ac3.7/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\nThe following table shows the main features of the standard plans, the amounts invested in the plans and the valuation assumptions applied in 2021 and 2020:\n\n|                                                                                 | 2021                                         | 2020                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Plan characteristics                                                            |                                              |                                              |\n| Date of Shareholders' Meeting                                                   | June/uni00A06, 2019 (22nd/uni00A0Resolution) | June/uni00A06, 2019 (22nd/uni00A0Resolution) |\n| Date of the Chief executive officer's decision fixing the subscription price    | March/uni00A015                              | June/uni00A015                               |\n| Plan duration (in years)                                                        | 5 or 10                                      | 5 or 10                                      |\n| Reference price (in EUR)                                                        | 44.76                                        | 28.79                                        |\n| Subscription price (in EUR)                                                     | 35.81                                        | 23.03                                        |\n| Discount (in %)                                                                 | 20.00%                                       | 20.00%                                       |\n| Total discount on the date of the Chief executive officer's decision (in %) (a) | 25.97%                                       | 24.57%                                       |\n| Employee investments (in EUR millions)                                          | 199.2                                        | 140.5                                        |\n| Total number of shares subscribed                                               | 5,562,855                                    | 6,099,996                                    |\n| Valuation assumptions (5-year maturity)                                         |                                              |                                              |\n| Interest rate applicable to employees*                                          | 3.50%                                        | 4.80%                                        |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                                         | -0.51%                                       | -0.45%                                       |\n| Repo rate                                                                       | 0.51%                                        | 0.29%                                        |\n| Lock-up discount (in %) (b)                                                     | 19.12%                                       | 21.77%                                       |\n| Total cost to the Group (in %) (a-b)                                            | 6.85%                                        | 2.80%                                        |\n\n- A 0.5-point decline in borrowing costs for the employee would increase the expense as calculated in accordance with IFRS/uni00A02 by \u20ac3.6/uni00A0million in * 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Stock option plans 6.4.2\n\nUntil 2018, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain operated stock option plans for certain employees.\n\nUnder these plans, the Board of Directors granted options allowing beneficiaries to obtain Saint-Gobain shares at a price set, at no discount, by reference to the average of the opening prices for the Saint-Gobain share over the 20/uni00A0stock market trading days preceding the date of the decision by the Board of Directors.\n\nFor all of the plans, beneficiaries must wait at least four years from the grant date to exercise any options. None of the options received may be exercised until this four-year period has lapsed. Options must be exercised within 10/uni00A0years of the grant date. Except in specified circumstances, grantees forfeit these options if they leave the Group.\n\nAmong the plans outstanding at December/uni00A031, 2021, the 2012 plan offers subscription options, while the 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017 plans offer purchase options. For plan launched in 2018, the Board of Directors has decided that it would determine the type of option (subscription or purchase) at the latest on the day before the start of the exercise period, with any options exercised prior to such decision considered as subscription options.\n\nA performance condition applies for all beneficiaries under current plans.\n\nNo stock options plan has been launched since 2019.\n\nThe following table presents changes in the number of outstanding options:\n\n|                                                 | \u20ac4 par value shares   | Average exercise price (in EUR)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2019 | 1,057,522             | 40.12                             |\n| Options granted                                 |                       |                                   |\n| Options exercised                               |                       |                                   |\n| Options forfeited                               | (212,998)             | 40.43                             |\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2020 | 844,524               | 40.04                             |\n| Options granted                                 |                       |                                   |\n| Options exercised                               | (151,173)             | 38.59                             |\n| Options forfeited*                              | (83,875)              | 49.38                             |\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2021 | 609,476               | 39.11                             |\n\n- Including 66,875/uni00A0options granted under the 2017/uni00A0stock option plan * that lapsed because the performance conditions were not met, and 17,000 lapsed after they had been withdrawn.\n\nThe cost of stock option plans is calculated using the Black & Scholes option pricing model.\n\nThe following inputs were used:\n\n- volatility assumptions that take into account the /uni25A0 historical volatility of the share price over a rolling 10-year period, as well as implied volatility from traded share options. Periods of extreme share price volatility are disregarded;\n- assumptions relating to the average holding period of /uni25A0 options, based on observed behavior of option holders;\n- expected dividends, as estimated on the basis of /uni25A0 historical dividend information dating back to 1988;\n- a risk-free interest rate corresponding to the yield on /uni25A0 long-term government bonds;\n- the effect of any stock market performance conditions, /uni25A0 which is taken into account in the initial measurement of IFRS/uni00A02/uni00A0share-based payment expense.\n\nThe cost calculated using this method is recognized in the income statement over the vesting period of the options, which is a maximum of four years.\n\nUnder IFRS/uni00A02, the expense attributable to the amortization of stock options granted under previous plans totaled \u20ac0.4/uni00A0million in 2021 (\u20ac0.7/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\n8",

These plans are subject to eligibility criteria based on the grantee's period of service (service conditions) with the Group as well as performance criteria (performance conditions), which are described below. The IFRS/uni00A02/uni00A0share-based payment expense takes into account these conditions and the lock-up feature. It is determined after deducting the present value of the dividends forfeited on the performance shares and is recognized over the vesting period, not exceeding four years.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, performance unit plans have been set up for certain employees in France. These plans are also subject to service and performance conditions. The IFRS/uni00A02/uni00A0share-based payment expense therefore takes into account these factors, as well as the fact that the units are cash-settled. IFRS/uni00A02/uni00A0stipulates that for cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the granted instruments are initially measured at fair value at the grant date, then remeasured at the end of each reporting period, with the expense adjusted accordingly pro rata to the rights that have vested at the reporting date. The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the rights.\n\n## 6.4.3.1 Performance share plans\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, there were four outstanding performance share plans, approved by the Board of Directors in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and on November/uni00A025, 2021.\n\nThe expense recorded for these plans in the 2021 income statement amounted to \u20ac44.4/uni00A0million (2020: \u20ac27.6/uni00A0million).\n\nAll plans are subject to service and performance conditions. The vesting period for the shares awarded under these plans is four years and the shares will be delivered under all plans the fourth day after the end of the vesting period for the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 plans.\n\nThe table below shows changes in the number of performance share rights:\n\n|                                                                | Number of rights   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE RIGHTS AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2019 | 4,927,869          |\n| Performance share rights granted in November/uni00A02020       | 1,268,295          |\n| Shares issued/delivered                                        | (733,024)          |\n| Lapsed and canceled rights                                     | (497,306)          |\n| NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE RIGHTS AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2020 | 4,965,834          |\n| Performance share rights granted in November/uni00A02021       | 1,184,475          |\n| Shares issued/delivered                                        | (904,712)          |\n| Lapsed and canceled rights*                                    | (324,838)          |\n| NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE RIGHTS AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2021 | 4,920,759          |\n\n- Rights granted under the 2017 plan, including 237,758 rights that * lapsed because the performance condition had only been partly met, and 87,080 rights that lapsed after they had been withdrawn.\n\nThe fair value of the performance shares corresponds to the Saint-Gobain share price on the grant date less the value of dividends not payable on the shares during the vesting period and, as for the Group Savings Plan, minus the cost of the four-year lock-up feature, which has been estimated at around 30% of the share price. The expense is recognized over the vesting period, which covers a maximum of four years.",

IFRS allows a 12-month period after the acquisition date ('measurement period') to identify the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity that were not recognized in the initial accounting for the combination, and to retroactively modify the amounts initially allocated.\n\nThe final acquisition price ('consideration transferred' in IFRS/uni00A03R), including, as appropriate, the estimated fair value of any earn-out payments or other deferred consideration ('contingent consideration' in IFRS/uni00A03R), is determined in the 12/uni00A0months following the acquisition. Under IFRS/uni00A03R, any adjustments to the acquisition price beyond this 12-month period are recorded in the income statement. Directly attributable acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIn addition, goodwill is recognized only at the date that control is achieved. Any subsequent increase in ownership\n\ninterest (without change of control) is recorded as a change in equity without adjusting goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as the difference between (i)/uni00A0the acquisition-date fair value plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree - measured either at fair value (full goodwill method) or at the proportionate interest in the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired (partial goodwill method) - and (ii)/uni00A0the net amount of assets and liabilities acquired at their fair value at the acquisition date. The Group generally applies the partial goodwill method and the amount of goodwill calculated under the full goodwill method is not therefore material.\n\nAny excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds their acquisition cost, this negative difference is recognized in the income statement in the year of acquisition.\n\nChanges in goodwill in 2021 and 2020 are detailed below:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                          | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| At January/uni00A01                                        |                 |                 |\n| Gross value                                                | 12,229          | 12,495          |\n| Accumulated impairment                                     | (2,201)         | (2,466)         |\n| NET VALUE                                                  | 10,028          | 10,029          |\n| Changes during the year                                    |                 |                 |\n| Impairment                                                 | (30)            | (201)           |\n| Translation adjustments and restatement for hyperinflation | 354             | (484)           |\n| Changes in Group structure                                 | 815             | 719             |\n| Assets held for sale                                       | 14              | (35)            |\n| TOTAL CHANGES                                              | 1,153           | (1)             |\n| At December/uni00A031                                      |                 |                 |\n| Gross value                                                | 13,399          | 12,229          |\n| Accumulated impairment                                     | (2,218)         | (2,201)         |\n| NET VALUE                                                  | 11,181          | 10,028          |\n\nIn 2021, changes in Group structure mainly reflect first-time consolidations following the acquisition of Chryso (see note/uni00A04.2.1) for \u20ac722/uni00A0million and of Equflow and Duraziv for \u20ac20/uni00A0million and \u20ac17/uni00A0million, respectively, as well as adjustments to purchase price accounting in progress.

They include mainly the costs of topographical or geological studies, drilling costs, sampling costs and all costs incurred in assessing the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the mineral resource.\n\nMaterial borrowing costs incurred for the construction and acquisition of property, plant and equipment are included in the cost of the related asset if they are significant.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are considered as having no residual value, as they chiefly consist of industrial assets that are intended to be used until the end of their useful lives.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment other than land are depreciated using the components approach on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives, which are regularly reviewed:\n\n- Major factories and offices /uni25A0\n\n30-40/uni00A0years\n\n- Other buildings /uni25A0\n\n15-25/uni00A0years\n\n- Production machinery and equipment /uni25A0\n\n5-16/uni00A0years\n\n- Vehicles /uni25A0\n\n3-5/uni00A0years\n\n- Furniture, fixtures, office and computer equipment /uni25A0\n\n4-16/uni00A0years\n\nGypsum quarries are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, based on the quantity of gypsum extracted during the year compared with extraction capacity.\n\nProvisions for site restoration are recognized as a component of assets whenever the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to restore a site in accordance with contractually determined conditions or in the event of a sudden deterioration in site conditions. These provisions are reviewed periodically and may be discounted over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. The component is depreciated over the same useful life as that used for mines and quarries.\n\nGovernment grants for purchases of property plant and equipment are recorded under 'Other payables' and taken to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of the relevant assets. They are included within operating items on the line corresponding to the nature of the asset.\n\nChanges in property, plant and equipment in 2021 and 2020 are analyzed below:\n\n| (in EUR millions)

        "page_content": "In 2021, changes in Group structure relate mainly to the first-time consolidation of Chryso. Translation adjustments and  restatement  for  hyperinflation  primarily  reflect  the impacts of fluctuations in the US dollar, pound sterling, Chinese  renminbi,  Indian  rupee,  Mexican  peso,  Czech koruna, Norwegian krone, Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and Turkish lira.\n\nIn 2020, changes in Group structure related mainly to the first-time consolidation of Continental Building Products. Translation adjustments and restatement for hyperinflation primarily  reflected  the  impacts  of  fluctuations  in  the Brazilian real, US dollar, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, pound sterling, Polish zloty, Russian ruble and Argentine peso.\n\n## Right-of-use assets linked 7.4 to leases\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group has chosen to apply IFRS/uni00A016 using the full retrospective method at January/uni00A01, 2019 ( i.e. , with effect  from  January/uni00A01,  2018)  and  has  restated  all  of  its leases that were identified ahead of first-time application of the standard. Entities' historical lease contracts were restated with effect from the date on which the entities were first consolidated by the Group.\n\nThe  following  recognition  exemptions  proposed  by IFRS/uni00A016 have been used by the Group:\n\n- leases with a lease term of 12/uni00A0months or less; /uni25A0\n- leases where the underlying asset has a value of less /uni25A0 than USD 5,000 when new.\n\n## Property leases\n\nThe lease term corresponds to the non-cancelable period of the lease, plus any renewal (or termination) options that the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  (or  not  to exercise).  The  Group  determined  whether  or  not  lease renewal (or termination) options were reasonably certain to  be  exercised  based  on  the  location  of,  and  any improvements  inseparable  from,  the  leased  asset.  The lease term at inception for '3/6/9-year' commercial leases in  France  is  generally  nine  years.  The  Group  did  not identify any material leases with similar characteristics in other countries.\n\n2021 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nAt  December/uni00A031,  2019  and  with  retroactive  effect  from January/uni00A01, 2018, Saint-Gobain took account of the IFRIC's November/uni00A02019 agenda decision in reviewing the terms of its automatically renewable leases, considering the importance of the underlying assets to its operations.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease liability is the incremental  borrowing  rate.  This  rate  is  applied  at  the commencement of the lease or at the date of the decision to  renew  the  lease.  The  Group  calculated  the  rate applicable  to  each  lease  contract  on  the  basis  of  its duration, which reflects the payment profile of the lease liability.\n\nThe useful life of non-movable leasehold improvements cannot exceed the useful life of the right-of-use assets to which they relate.\n\n## Leases other than property leases\n\nThe  main  leases  identified  correspond  to  leases  of vehicles, machinery and production equipment.\n\nThe lease capitalization period (lease term) represents the non-cancelable period of the lease. Where leases provide for a renewal  (or  termination) option, the Group determined whether or not that option was reasonably certain to be exercised based on the ease with which the leased asset could be replaced and its criticality.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the lease liability is calculated using the same approach as for property leases.\n\nThe  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  is  used  as  the discount rate only in the case of non-property leases and only if this is expressly stipulated in the lease contract.\n\nAlthough  leases  can  generally  incorporate  indexation clauses,  lease  liabilities  are  measured  based  solely  on indexes known at the end of the reporting period.\n\nAt  December/uni00A031,  2021,  right-of-use  assets  under  leases relate  mainly  to  land  and  buildings  for  \u20ac2,419/uni00A0million (\u20ac2,367/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020) and to machinery and equipment for \u20ac540/uni00A0million (\u20ac535/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nLease payments made under low-value and/or short-term leases,  along  with  variable  lease  payments  or  lease payments  falling  outside  the  scope  of  IFRS/uni00A016,  totaled \u20ac169/uni00A0million in 2021 (\u20ac158/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\n8",

These tests consist of comparing the asset's carrying amount to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, calculated by reference to the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.\n\nFor property, plant and equipment, amortizable intangible assets and right-of-use assets, an impairment test is performed whenever revenues from the asset decline or the asset generates operating losses due to either internal or external factors, and no material improvement is forecast in the relevant business plan.\n\nFor goodwill and other unamortized intangible assets (including brands with indefinite useful lives), an impairment test is performed at least annually based on financial forecasts. Goodwill is reviewed systematically and\n\nexhaustively at the level of each cash-generating unit (CGU).\n\nIn 2021, the number of CGUs was reduced from 27 to 23, following various disposals and reorganizations within the Group.\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their net carrying amount.\n\nThe method used for these impairment tests is consistent with that used by the Group to value companies acquired in business combinations or acquisitions of equity interests. The carrying amount of the CGUs is compared to their value in use, corresponding to the net present value of future cash flows excluding interest but including tax. It is determined using assumptions made by management based on estimates and judgments including future changes in sales, profitability, investments and other cash flows arising from the use of the corresponding assets, as well as the discount rate applied to future cash flows. Cash flows for the last year of the business plan beyond the three-year forecast period are rolled forward over the following two years. For impairment tests of goodwill, normative cash flows (corresponding to cash flows at the mid-point in the business cycle) are then projected to perpetuity using an annual growth rate (between 1.5% and",

This  rate corresponds to the Group's average cost of capital, plus a country risk premium where applicable, depending on the geographic area concerned.\n\nThe rates applied in 2021 were 6.85% for Western Europe and  North  America,  7.85%  for  Eastern  Europe  and emerging Asia-Pacific, 8.35% for Latin America, and 9.35% for Russia and Turkey.\n\n## CGU impairment tests 7.5.2\n\nWhen  the  annual  impairment  test  reveals  that  the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded.\n\nImpairment  losses  on  goodwill  can  never  be  reversed through income. For property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, an impairment loss recognized in prior  periods  may  be  reversed,  taking  into  account depreciation/amortization  adjustments,  if  there  is  an indication that the impairment no longer exists and that the recoverable amount of the asset concerned exceeds its carrying amount.\n\nDuring the impairment  tests, different assumptions measuring  the  method's  sensitivity  are  systematically tested using the following inputs:\n\n- 0.5-point increase in the discount rate applied to cash /uni25A0 flows;\n- 0.5-point decrease in the annual average rate of growth /uni25A0 in cash flows projected to perpetuity;\n- 1-point  decrease  in  the  operating  income  rate  for /uni25A0 Industry activities and 0.5-point decrease for Distribution activities.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  sensitivity  tests  carried  out  at December/uni00A031, 2021  ( i.e. , sensitivity  to  changes  in  the discount  rate,  perpetuity  growth  rate  and  profitability rate), three CGUs were identified as sensitive: the United Kingdom Distribution CGU and the two Pipe CGUs.\n\nAs the outlook improved for the Southern Europe - Flat Glass and Brazil Distribution businesses, these CGUs are no longer considered sensitive.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, a 0.5-point increase in the discount rate  for  all  CGUs  would  have  led  to  approximately \u20ac28/uni00A0million in additional impairment of non-current assets, concerning mainly the Pipe Europe CGU.\n\nA  0.5-point  decrease  in  the  average  annual  cash  flow growth rate projected to perpetuity for all CGUs would have resulted in additional non-current asset impairment of  around  \u20ac22/uni00A0million,  also  mainly  affecting  the  Pipe Europe CGU.\n\nThe impact of a 1-point decrease in the operating income rate for all Industry CGUs would have generated additional non-current asset impairment of approximately \u20ac154/uni00A0million,  primarily  affecting  the  two  Pipe  CGUs.  A 0.5-point decrease in the rate for Distribution activities would  have  generated  additional  impairment  of  around \u20ac132/uni00A0million for the United Kingdom Distribution CGU.\n\nOwing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group decided to perform an additional one-off sensitivity analysis, incorporating broader criteria, i.e. :\n\n- 0.75-point increase in the discount rate applied to cash /uni25A0 flows;\n- 1.5-point  decrease  in  the  operating  income  rate  for /uni25A0 Industry activities and a 1-point decrease for Distribution activities.\n\n8",

Although turnaround plans have been put in place and are ongoing, we continue to adopt a cautious outlook for this CGU, which is sensitive to a change in the profitability rate.\n\nIn 2021, the Pipe Europe CGU saw strong inflation in raw materials needed to manufacture cast iron (iron ore, scrap metal, coke). The outlook for 2022 is better, thanks in particular to the favorable impact of sales price increases generated in the last four months of 2021. The CGU remains sensitive to a change in the discount rate, perpetuity growth rate and profitability rate.\n\nThe planned privatization of water distribution companies in Brazil has confirmed the prospects of recovery and medium-term profitability for the Latin America Pipe CGU. The CGU remains sensitive to a change in the discount or profitability rate.\n\n2021 confirmed the prospects of recovery and profitability for the Brazil Distribution CGU. At the end of 2021, the CGU is no longer sensitive to any of the changes in the discount rate, perpetuity growth rate or profitability rate tested.\n\nThe assumptions used in the asset impairment tests take into account the actions envisaged in connection with the Group's commitment to reduce by 2030 its scope/uni00A01 and 2 net carbon emissions by 33% compared to 2017 in order to limit its impact on the environment and contribute to the decarbonization of its markets, in particular an annual amount of \u20ac100/uni00A0million in capital expenditure and research and development expenditure set aside to further its environmental strategy to reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nIn addition, although the current legal environment in the various countries in which the Group operates does not tax, outside the European Union, tonnes of CO2 emitted in excess of any allowances allocated, and in line with its emissions reduction strategy, the Group has carried out sensitivity tests on the value of its CGUs, assuming a carbon price of \u20ac75 and \u20ac95 per tonne as of 2022, as well as the maintenance or development of government support mechanisms such as the allocation of CO2 emissions allowances. If these assumptions were to prove accurate, no significant additional impairment would need to be recognized against fixed assets.",

        "page_content": "2021 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Provisions for claims, litigation 9.1.1 and environmental risks\n\nThese provisions cover costs relating to litigation, environmental protection measures, as well as site rehabilitation and clean-up costs.\n\nThey cover in particular PFOA-related proceedings and the antitrust lawsuit in the Distribution sector in Switzerland.\n\nLitigation provisions amounted to \u20ac155/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021. These provisions are described in further detail in note/uni00A09.2 'Contingent liabilities and litigation'.\n\nThe decrease in provisions for claims and litigation at December/uni00A031, 2020 primarily reflected the deconsolidation of DBMP/uni00A0LLC, which carried on its books the legacy asbestos-related claims against the former CertainTeed Corporation. The offsetting entry for this decrease was a rise in provisions for other risks, which mainly results from the financing commitments undertaken by CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC in favor of DBMP/uni00A0LLC (see note/uni00A09.2.2.2 discussing asbestos-related liabilities in the United States).\n\n## Provisions for restructuring costs 9.1.2 and personnel expenses\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs and personnel expenses amounted to \u20ac163/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021 (December/uni00A031, 2020: \u20ac222/uni00A0million).\n\nThese provisions cover restructuring transactions (personnel costs and other charges linked to reorganization plans), as well as provisions for personnel expenses unrelated to restructuring plans, in particular provisions for severance payments.\n\n## Provisions for customer warranties 9.1.3\n\nThese provisions cover the Group's commitments under warranties granted to customers mainly in the United States. They are determined on a statistical basis using a range of criteria and take into account contractual warranty payments made in prior years in the business and region concerned. In addition, specific provisions may be set aside for identified contingencies in the context of a specific claim.\n\n## Provisions for other contingencies 9.1.4\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, provisions for other contingencies amount to \u20ac580/uni00A0million (December/uni00A031, 2020: \u20ac524/uni00A0million) and mainly concern the United States (\u20ac427/uni00A0million), France (\u20ac52/uni00A0million) and Brazil (\u20ac68/uni00A0million).\n\n## Investment-related liabilities 9.1.5\n\nInvestment-related liabilities correspond to commitments to purchase minority interests, liabilities relating to the acquisition of shares in Group companies, and minority shareholder puts.\n\nIn 2021, changes in investment-related liabilities primarily concerned liabilities relating to the acquisition of equity interests.\n\n## Contingent liabilities and litigation 9.2\n\n## Antitrust law and related proceedings 9.2.1\n\n## 9.2.1.1 Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission in the sanitary products wholesale industry\n\nIn November/uni00A02011, the Swiss Competition Commission ( Commission suisse de la concurrence ) opened an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the sanitary products wholesale industry. In May/uni00A02014, the Commission Secretariat issued a notice of complaints against Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other things, agreed in 2005 and 2012 to lower gross prices.\n\nThe total fine imposed on all companies involved is CHF/uni00A080/uni00A0million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF/uni00A028.8/uni00A0million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May/uni00A02, 2016 and continues to firmly refute the claims made. The hearing took place before the Federal Administrative Court on January/uni00A021, 2020 and the date on which the Federal Administrative Court will issue its decision is not yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December/uni00A031, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged as at December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## 9.2.1.2 Investigation by the French Competition Authority in the building insulation products industry\n\nOn July/uni00A028, 2014, the French Competition Authority sent a statement of objections to Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (as parent company of the Saint-Gobain Group). A hearing took place on May/uni00A011,/uni00A02016, whereupon the Competition Authority sent the case back for further investigation in light of the arguments put forward by Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. In October/uni00A02018, Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain received a second statement of objections, in which the Competition Authority alleges anti-competitive practices in the building insulation products market, between 2001 and 2013.\n\nSaint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain rejected the allegations in their response to the second statement of objections filed in January/uni00A02019.\n\nA new report was sent by the Authority at the end of 2019, which gave rise to comments in response from Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain on February/uni00A011, 2020.\n\nThe hearing before the Competition Authority was held on October/uni00A06, 2020. By decision dated January/uni00A014, 2021, the French Competition Authority considered that the alleged anti-competitive practices were not established and dismissed all the objections notified.\n\nActis appealed this decision to the Paris Court of Appeal on February/uni00A026, 2021, following which the other parties, including Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain filed incidental appeals. Hearing is expected to occur end of 2022.",

        "page_content": "On  the  civil  law  front,  Actis  served  in  March/uni00A02013  a damages  claim  on  Saint-Gobain  Isover,  the  Centre scientifique  et  technique  du  b\u00e2timent,  and  the  FILMM before the Paris Civil Court ( Tribunal judiciaire de Paris ) based on the facts being investigated by the Competition Authority. A stay of proceedings has been declared and following  the  dismissal  decided  by  the  Competition Authority  and  the  appeal  filed  by  Actis  against  such dismissal,  Actis  requested  that  the  proceeding  remain stayed until the Paris Court of Appeal's decision to be made in relation to the appeal filed by Actis against the dismissal decision of the Competition Authority.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation 9.2.2\n\nCurrent legal actions related to asbestos are described below.\n\n## 9.2.2.1 Asbestos-related litigation in France\n\n## Inexcusable fault lawsuits\n\nIn  France,  where  Everite  and  Saint-Gobain  PAM  had carried  out  fiber-cement  operations  in  the  past,  seven additional lawsuits to those brought since 1996 were filed in 2021 by former employees (or persons claiming through them) for recognition of inexcusable fault resulting from exposure for asbestos-related occupational diseases.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, a total of 844 lawsuits had been issued against the two companies since 1996 with the aim of obtaining supplementary compensation over and above the amounts paid by the French Social Security authorities in this respect.\n\nAs of the same date, 812 of these 844 lawsuits had been completed, the employer's inexcusable fault having been upheld in all of these cases. 32 actions are still pending against Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM.\n\nCompensation  paid  by  Everite  and  Saint-Gobain  PAM since the outset of these litigations in settlement of these lawsuits totaled approximately \u20ac6.6/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021  (compared  to  \u20ac6.2/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nIn addition, as of December/uni00A031, 2021, a total of 272 similar suits had been filed since the outset of the litigation by current or former employees, or persons claiming through them, of 13 French companies of the Group (excluding suits against companies that are no longer part of the Group), in particular by current or former employees who in the past used equipment containing asbestos to protect themselves against heat from furnaces.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, 230 of this 272 lawsuits had been completed, with the employer's inexcusable fault having been upheld in 147 of them. 42 actions were still pending at the same date.\n\nThe total amount of compensation paid since the outset of the  litigation  by  these  companies  was  approximately \u20ac10.5/uni00A0million as  of  December/uni00A031, 2021  (compared  to approximately \u20ac8.7/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## Anxiety claims\n\nEight of the Group's subsidiaries, including six that operate or have  operated  facilities in France  classified as containing asbestos, were the subject of anxiety claims.\n\n'Facilities classified as containing asbestos' are defined as industrial  facilities,  that  have  been  closed  or  are  still operating, which previously manufactured materials containing  asbestos  or  used  protection  and  insulation equipment containing asbestos and that are included by ministerial  decree  on  the  official  list  of  facilities  whose current or former employees  are  entitled to the early-retirement benefit paid to asbestos workers (ACAATA).\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, a total of 824 lawsuits had been brought by current or former employees - benefiting from ACAATA or not - claiming compensation for prejudice of anxiety suffered as a result of their alleged exposure to asbestos.  These  824  suits  have  all  been  definitely completed, representing a total amount of compensation of  \u20ac8.5/uni00A0million  as  of  December/uni00A031,  2021  (compared  to \u20ac7.6/uni00A0million as at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nIt should be clarified that the above figures do not take into  account  suits  filed  against  companies  that  are  no longer part of the Group.\n\nThe  provision  related  to  asbestos-related  litigation  in France amounted to around \u20ac6.9/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021  (compared  to  \u20ac5.5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## 9.2.2.2 Situation in the United States\n\n## Action taken to achieve equitable and permanent Resolution of the former CertainTeed Corporation's legacy asbestos liabilities in the United States\n\nDBMP/uni00A0LLC, an affiliate of CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC based in North Carolina, that holds the legacy asbestos liabilities of the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  filed,  on  January/uni00A023, 2020, a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter/uni00A011 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Western  District  of  North  Carolina  in  Charlotte.  The purpose  of  the  filing  is  to  achieve  a  certain,  final  and equitable Resolution of all current and future claims arising from asbestos-containing products manufactured and sold by the former CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP/uni00A0LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under Section/uni00A0524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve a fair and equitable Resolution of its asbestos-related  liabilities.  Upon  establishment  of  the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will  be  able  to  receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims without the delay, stress and uncertainty of litigation in the tort system; at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally resolve DBMP/uni00A0LLC's asbestos liability.\n\nDuring the course of this bankruptcy process, which is expected to take approximately three to eight years, all asbestos  litigation  will  be  stayed  and  all  related  costs suspended,  providing  DBMP/uni00A0LLC  with  the  time  and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\n8",

Despite the passage of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity for claimants to assert legitimate claims of exposure to the asbestos-containing products of the former CertainTeed Corporation, naming practices in the tort system continued to result in a steady volume of claims against DBMP/uni00A0LLC, with no foreseeable end in sight. In addition, there has been, in general, an escalation of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system\n\n## Impact on the Group's financial statements\n\nFollowing the commencement of the proceeding under Chapter/uni00A011 of the US Bankruptcy Code on January/uni00A023, 2020, the assets and liabilities of DBMP/uni00A0LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary Millwork & Panel/uni00A0LLC, and in particular the provision for asbestos-related litigation in the United States, are no longer consolidated in the Group's financial statements.\n\nNonetheless, because of a funding agreement between CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC and DBMP/uni00A0LLC by which CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC has agreed to fund the costs of the Chapter/uni00A011 case and, ultimately, the 524(g) trust, in both cases solely to the extent DBMP/uni00A0LLC is unable to do so in full, the Group recorded in its consolidated financial statements a debt against DBMP/uni00A0LLC amounting to $417/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nThe Group's consolidated income for 2021 is not impacted by the ongoing Chapter/uni00A011 proceeding described above.\n\nAs a result of this bankruptcy proceeding, all legal costs and indemnity payments related to DBMP/uni00A0LLC's asbestos tort claims have been suspended, and no further charges in relation to such claims have been taken in 2021 (as in 2020).\n\n## 9.2.2.3 Situation in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, former employees of Brasilit, that once manufactured fiber cement containing asbestos, suffering from asbestos-related occupational illnesses are offered, depending on the case, either financial compensation alone or lifetime medical assistance combined with financial compensation. Around 1,200/uni00A0contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambouc state) plants, asking for their medical assistance and compensation to be revised. First and second instance decisions were rendered in connection with the first suit respectively in July/uni00A02020 and July/uni00A02021, rejecting the claims of the plaintiffs. The latter have nevertheless appealed the second instance decision. The suit related to Recife is still at an early stage and there is no court decision issued so far.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari (State of S\u00e3o Paulo) by the Labor prosecutor asking for health insurance, as well as collective moral damages, in favor of employees, former employees and their respective families, as well as subcontractors who were exposed to asbestos. A first instance decision was rendered in September/uni00A02020 partly in favor of the plaintiffs. In particular, collective moral damages were granted to the plaintiffs, for an amount reduced to BRL 5/uni00A0million (\u20ac0.8/uni00A0million). Brasilit has appealed the decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues to comply with all of its legal obligations with regard to medical assistance for its current and former employees.\n\nIn November/uni00A02017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban asbestos definitively across the country. Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002\n\n## Environmental disputes 9.2.3\n\n## PFOA matters in the United States\n\nLevels of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) in excess of US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or state maximum contaminant levels for drinking water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New Hampshire), and two former facilities in North Bennington (Vermont) in the United States. PFOA and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured by these plants. SG PPL is a processor of PTFE which it purchases from third-party suppliers and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick Falls and funded the installation of a carbon filtration system on the Merrimack Valley District's municipal water supply. In addition, it has voluntarily funded construction of water line extensions in certain communities in the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going and the scope of responsibility for SG PPL arising from environmental remediation in New Hampshire and New York and clean-up obligations at these sites has not yet been established. The scope of the remediation in Vermont is defined and largely completed; future operation and maintenance obligations remain. Without admitting liability, SG PPL has signed consent orders with the environmental regulators in New York in 2016, in Vermont in 2017 and 2019 with respect to two different areas, and in New Hampshire in 2018, pursuant to which SG PPL has agreed to complete investigations, implement interim or final remediation measures at its current and former facilities and in the case of Vermont and New Hampshire, fund construction of water lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related lawsuits alleging both health-related and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of proposed or certified class actions. It is difficult to predict the timing or outcome of any such litigation, or whether any additional litigation will be brought against SG PPL, however, both the New York and Vermont class actions have signed settlements, the Vermont settlement remaining under final review by the courts.\n\nOn December/uni00A031, 2021, the provision recorded by the Company in respect of this matter amounts to \u20ac116/uni00A0million (compared to \u20ac31/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020). This provision covers fully the amount of the New York and Vermont class action settlements, as well as various other costs related to PFOA matters including remediation works.",

The Inquiry is conducting its work in two phases: its phase/uni00A01 report was published  on  October/uni00A030,  2019,  phase/uni00A02  commenced  in January/uni00A02020 - public hearings are expected to continue until July/uni00A02022, with a final report to follow some time thereafter. A criminal investigation into the circumstances of the fire is also in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the implications for Celotex are unlikely to be known for some time. Civil proceedings in connection with Grenfell Tower brought against Celotex Limited  and/or  Saint-Gobain  Construction  Products  UK\n\nLimited (which respectively held the Celotex business until or  after  December/uni00A031,  2015)  and  a  number  of  other defendants - who are also core participants in the Public Inquiry - have been issued and are stayed prior to the service of full pleadings. No figure has yet been put on the quantum claimed.\n\nThe extent to which Celotex may incur civil or criminal liability  in  connection  with  the  production,  marketing, supply  or  use  of  its  products  is  currently  unclear  and Celotex Limited and Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## Other proceedings and disputes 9.2.5\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other claims made by their employees or by the tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses (see note/uni00A05.5.2). Apart from the proceedings and  litigation  described  above,  to  the  best  of  the Company's  knowledge,  no  other  government,  court  or arbitration proceedings exist (including pending proceedings or proceedings where the Company and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had,  in  the  last  12/uni00A0months,  a  significant  impact  on  the financial position or profitability of the Company and/or Group.\n\n## Financing and financial instruments NOTE 10\n\n## Financial risks 10.1\n\n## Liquidity risk 10.1.1\n\n## 10.1.1.1 Liquidity risk on financing\n\nIn a crisis environment, the Group might be unable to raise the financing or refinancing needed  to  cover  its investment plans on the credit or capital markets, or to obtain such financing or refinancing on acceptable terms.\n\nThe Group's overall exposure to liquidity risk on its net debt is managed  by  the  Treasury  and  Financing Department of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, the Group's parent  company.  The  subsidiaries  generally  enter  into shortor long-term financing arrangements with Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  or  with  the  regional  cash pools.\n\nThe Group's policy is to ensure that the Group's financing will be rolled over at maturity and to optimize borrowing costs. Long-term debt therefore systematically represents a high percentage of overall debt. At the same time, the maturity schedules of long-term debt are set in such a way that replacement capital market issues are spread over time.\n\nThe  Group's  main  source  of  long-term  financing  is constituted by bonds, which are generally issued under the Medium Term Notes program. The Group also uses lease financing, perpetual bonds, participating securities, a long-term securitization program and bank borrowings.\n\nShort-term  debt  is  composed  of  borrowings  under Negotiable European Commercial Paper (NEU CP), and occasionally Euro Commercial Paper and US Commercial Paper, but also includes receivables securitization programs  and  bank  financing.  The  Group  also  has factoring programs. Financial assets comprise marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain's liquidity position is secured by confirmed syndicated lines of credit.\n\nA breakdown of long- and short-term debt by type and maturity is provided in note/uni00A010.3, which also details the main  characteristics  of  the  Group's  financing  programs and confirmed credit lines.\n\nSaint-Gobain's long-term debt issues have been rated BBB with  a  stable  outlook  by  Standard  &  Poor's  since April/uni00A030,/uni00A02014 and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's since June/uni00A02, 2014.\n\nThere  is  no  guarantee  that  the  Company  will  be  in  a position to maintain its credit risk ratings at current levels. Any deterioration in the Group's credit risk rating could limit its capacity to raise funds and could lead to higher rates of interest on future borrowings.\n\n## 10.1.1.2 Liquidity risk on investments\n\nShort-term  investments  consist  of  bank  deposits  and mutual fund units. To reduce liquidity and high volatility risks, the Group invests in money market funds and/or bonds whenever possible.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "2021 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Financial counterparty credit risk 10.1.2\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of default by the financial institutions that manage its cash or other financial instruments, since such default could lead to losses for the Group.\n\nThe Group limits its exposure to risk of default by its counterparties by dealing solely with reputable financial institutions and regularly monitoring their credit ratings. However, the credit quality of a financial counterparty can change rapidly, and a high credit rating cannot eliminate the risk of a rapid deterioration of its financial position. As a result, the Group's policy in relation to the selection and monitoring of its counterparties is unable to entirely eliminate exposure to a risk of default.\n\nTo limit Compagnie de Saint-Gobain's exposure to counterparty credit risk, the Treasury and Financing Department deals primarily with counterparties with a long-term rating of A- or above from Standard & Poor's or A3 or above from Moody's. Concentrations of credit risk are also closely monitored to ensure that they remain at reasonable levels, taking into account the relative CDS ('Credit Default Swap') level of each counterparty.\n\n## Market risks 10.1.3\n\n## 10.1.3.1 Energy and commodity risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to changes in the price of the energy it consumes and the raw materials used in its activities. Its energy and commodity hedging programs may be insufficient to protect the Group against significant or unforeseen price swings that could result from the prevailing financial and economic environment.\n\nThe Group may limit its exposure to energy price fluctuations by using swaps and options to hedge part of its fuel oil, natural gas and electricity purchases. The swaps and options are mainly contracted in the functional currency of the entities concerned. Hedges of fuel oil, gas and electricity purchases are contracted in accordance with the Group's purchasing policy.\n\nThese hedges (excluding fixed-price purchases negotiated directly with suppliers by the Purchasing Department) are generally arranged by the Group Treasury and Financing Department (or with regional Treasury Departments) in accordance with instructions received from the Purchasing Department.\n\nFrom time to time, the Group may enter into contracts to hedge purchases of certain commodities or engage in the CO2 emissions market, in accordance with the same principles as those outlined above for energy purchases.\n\nNote/uni00A010.4 provides a breakdown of instruments used to hedge energy and commodity risks.\n\n## 10.1.3.2 Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's overall exposure to interest rate risk on consolidated debt is managed by the Treasury and Financing Department of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain.\n\nThe Group's policy is aimed at fixing and optimizing its medium-term borrowing costs by hedging interest rate risk. According to Group policy, the derivative financial instruments used to hedge interest rate risk can include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, options -including caps, floors and swaptions - and forward rate agreements.\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity at December/uni00A031, 2021 of pre-tax income and pre-tax equity to fluctuations in the interest rate on the Group's net debt after hedging:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                         | Impact on pre-tax income   | Impact on pre-tax equity   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Interest rate increase of 50 basis points |                            |                            |\n|                                           | 23                         | 7                          |\n| Interest rate decrease of 50 basis points | (23)                       | (7)                        |\n\nNote/uni00A010.4 provides a breakdown of instruments used to hedge interest rate risk and of gross debt by type of interest (fixed or variable) after hedging.\n\n## 10.1.3.3 Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe currency hedging policies described below could be insufficient to protect the Group against unexpected or sharper than expected fluctuations in exchange rates resulting from economic and financial market conditions.\n\nForeign exchange risks are managed by hedging virtually all transactions entered into by Group entities in currencies other than the functional currency of the particular entity. Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and its subsidiaries may use forward contracts and options to hedge exposures arising from current and forecast transactions.\n\nThe subsidiaries generally set up contracts through the Group's parent company, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, which then carries out the corresponding forex hedging transactions on their behalf, or through the regional cash pools. Failing this, contracts are taken out with one of the subsidiary's banks.\n\nMost forward contracts have short maturities of around three months. However, forward contracts taken out to hedge firm orders may have longer terms.\n\nThe Group monitors its exposure to foreign exchange risk using a monthly reporting system that captures the foreign exchange positions taken by its subsidiaries. At December/uni00A031, 2021, 98% of the Group's foreign exchange exposure was hedged.\n\nThe residual net foreign exchange exposure of subsidiaries for the currencies presented below was as follows at December/uni00A031, 2021:\n\n| (in millions of euro equivalent)   |   Long |   Short |\n|------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| EUR                                |      3 |       4 |\n| USD                                |     18 |       4 |\n| Other currencies                   |      0 |       2 |\n| TOTAL                              |     21 |      10 |",

Neither of these two lines of credit was drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## Receivables securitization programs 10.3.8\n\nThe Group has set up two receivables securitization programs, one through its French subsidiary Point.P Finances GIE, and the other through its US subsidiary, Saint-Gobain Receivables Corporation.\n\nThe French program, covering an amount of up to \u20ac500/uni00A0million, represented \u20ac500/uni00A0million at both December/uni00A031, 2021 and December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nBased on observed seasonal fluctuations in receivables included in the program and on the contract's features, \u20ac280/uni00A0million of this amount is classified as non-current and the remaining balance as current.\n\nUnder the US program, covering a maximum of up to USD 400/uni00A0million, a total of USD 298/uni00A0million had been drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2021. Its value amounts to an equivalent in euros of \u20ac263/uni00A0million compared to \u20ac144/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## Collateral 10.3.9\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, \u20ac2/uni00A0million of Group debt is secured by various non-current assets (real estate and securities).\n\n## Factoring 10.3.10\n\nThe Group has set up several trade receivables factoring programs. Based on an analysis of the risks and rewards as defined by IFRS/uni00A09, the Group has derecognized virtually all of the receivables sold under these programs. In all, \u20ac492/uni00A0million in factored receivables were derecognized at December/uni00A031, 2021, compared to \u20ac368/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## IBOR reform 10.3.11\n\nThe Group analyzed the impact of the reform of interbank offered rates (IBOR) on its financial instruments. No significant impact was identified for the instruments used. However, certain contracts were revised and information systems are being adapted accordingly.",

        "page_content": "## Financial instruments 10.4\n\nThe Group uses interest rate, foreign exchange, energy, commodity and equity derivatives to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and energy, commodity and equity prices that may arise in the normal course of business.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A032 and IFRS/uni00A09, all such instruments are recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value, irrespective of whether or not they are part of a hedging relationship that qualifies for hedge accounting under IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nChanges in the fair value of both derivatives that are designated and qualified as fair value hedges and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting during the period are taken to the income statement (in business income and expense for operational foreign exchange derivatives and commodity derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, and in financial income and expense for all other derivatives). However, in the case of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss arising from changes in fair value is recognized directly in equity, and only the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedge accounting is applied by the Group mainly for derivative instruments which swap fixed rates against variable rates (fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps). These derivatives hedge fixed-rate debt exposed to a fair value risk. In accordance with hedge accounting principles, debt included in a designated fair value hedging relationship is remeasured at fair value to the extent of the risk hedged. As the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item offsets the effective portion of the gain or loss on the fair value hedge, the income statement is only impacted by the ineffective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is applied by the Group mainly for derivative instruments which fix the cost of future investments (financial assets or property, plant and equipment) and the price of future purchases, mostly gas and fuel oil (commodity swaps) or foreign currencies (foreign exchange forwards). Transactions hedged by these instruments are qualified as highly probable. The application of cash flow hedge accounting allows the Group to defer the impact on the income statement of the effective portion of changes in the fair value of these derivatives by recording them in a hedging reserve in equity. This reserve is reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction occurs and the hedged item itself affects income. In the same way as for fair value hedges, cash flow hedging limits the Group's exposure to changes in the fair value of these derivatives to the ineffective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the income statement. The instruments concerned are primarily foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities corresponds to their quoted price on an active market (if any): this represents level/uni00A01 in the fair value hierarchy defined in IFRS/uni00A07 and IFRS/uni00A013. The fair value of instruments not quoted in an active market, such as derivatives or financial assets and liabilities, is determined by reference to commonly used valuation techniques such as the fair value of another recent and similar transaction, or discounted cash flow analysis based on observable market inputs. This represents level/uni00A02 in the fair value hierarchy defined in IFRS/uni00A07 and IFRS/uni00A013.\n\nThe fair value of short-term financial assets and liabilities is considered as being the same as their carrying amount due to their short maturities.\n\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the main derivatives used by the Group:\n\n|                                                                                                | Fair value                     | Fair value                          | Fair value    | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (in EUR millions)                                                                              | Derivatives recorded in assets | Derivatives recorded in liabilities | Dec. 31, 2021 | Dec./uni00A031, 2020         | Within 1/uni00A0year         | 1 to 5 years                 | Beyond 5/uni00A0years        | Dec. 31, 2021                |\n| FAIR VALUE HEDGES                                                                              | 0                              | 0                                   | 0             | 0                            | 0                            | 0                            | 0                            | 0                            |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                                               |                                |                                     |               |                              |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| Currency                                                                                       | 9                              | (3)                                 | 6             | 1                            | 520                          | 12                           | 0                            | 532                          |\n| Interest rate                                                                                  | 0                              | (60)                                | (60)          | (92)                         | 0                            | 95                           | 378                          | 473                          |\n| Energy and commodities                                                                         | 6                              | 0                                   | 6             | 0                            | 16                           | 1                            | 0                            | 17                           |\n| Other risks: equities                                                                          | 12                             | 0                                   | 12            | 0                            | 5                            | 25                           | 0                            | 30                           |\n| CASH FLOW HEDGES -

At December/uni00A031, 2021, credit value adjustments were not material.\n\n## Impact on equity of financial instruments 10.4.6 qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the IFRS cash flow hedge reserve carried in equity has a debit balance of \u20ac32/uni00A0million, consisting mainly of:\n\n- a debit balance of \u20ac27/uni00A0million in relation to /uni25A0 cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges that are used to convert a GBP bond issue into euros;\n- a debit balance of \u20ac17/uni00A0million corresponding to changes /uni25A0 in the fair value of interest rate hedges classified as cash flow hedges;\n- a credit balance of \u20ac6/uni00A0million corresponding to changes /uni25A0 in fair value of energy hedges qualified as cash flow hedges;\n- a credit balance of \u20ac6/uni00A0million corresponding to changes /uni25A0 in fair value of currency derivatives qualified as cash flow hedges.\n\nThe ineffective portion of cash flow hedge derivatives is not material.\n\n## Impact on income of financial instruments 10.4.7 not qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nThe fair value of derivatives classified as 'Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss' represents a gain of \u20ac14/uni00A0million in 2021 compared to a loss of \u20ac4/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\n## Embedded derivatives 10.4.8\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group regularly analyzes its contracts in order to separately identify financial instruments classified as embedded derivatives under IFRS.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, no embedded derivatives deemed to be material at Group level were identified.\n\n## Group debt structure 10.4.9 (excluding lease liabilities)\n\nThe weighted average interest rate on total gross debt under IFRS and after hedging (interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps) was 2.1% at December/uni00A031, 2021, compared with 2.0% at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nThe average internal rate of return for the main component of the Group's long-term debt before hedging (bonds) was 2.5% at December/uni00A031, 2021, compared with 2.4% at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nThe table below presents the breakdown by interest rate (fixed or variable) of the Group's gross debt at December/uni00A031, 2021, taking into account interest rate and cross-currency swaps.\n\n|                                              | Gross debt, excluding lease liabilities   | Gross debt, excluding lease liabilities   | Gross debt, excluding lease liabilities   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| (in EUR millions)                            | Variable rate                             | Fixed rate                                | Total                                     |\n| EUR                                          | 826                                       | 8,640                                     | 9,466                                     |\n| Other currencies                             | 549                                       | 906                                       | 1,455                                     |\n| TOTAL                                        | 1,375                                     | 9,546                                     | 10,921                                    |\n| (in %)                                       | 13%                                       | 87%                                       | 100%                                      |\n| Accrued interest and other                   |                                           |                                           | 154                                       |\n| TOTAL GROSS DEBT EXCLUDING LEASE LIABILITIES |                                           |                                           | 11,075                                    |",

Deferred tax liabilities of \u20ac555/uni00A0million were recognized at December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac360/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020), including \u20ac309/uni00A0million in the United Kingdom, \u20ac59/uni00A0million in Switzerland, \u20ac40/uni00A0million in India, and \u20ac39/uni00A0million in Denmark. Deferred tax liabilities in other countries were not material.\n\n## Tax loss carry-forwards 12.3\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only if it is considered probable that there will be sufficient future taxable income against which the temporary difference can be utilized. They are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and written down to the extent that it is no longer probable that there will be sufficient taxable income against which the temporary difference can be utilized. In determining whether to recognize deferred tax assets for tax loss carry-forwards, the Group applies a range of criteria that take into account the probable recovery period based on business plans and the strategy for the long-term recovery of tax losses applied in each country.\n\nThe Group recognized deferred tax assets for tax loss carry-forwards for a net amount of \u20ac410/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021 and \u20ac440/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020. This principally relates to the United States, for which the recovery period is shorter than the maximum utilization period of 20/uni00A0years, and to France, Germany and Spain, where tax consolidation generally ensures that deferred tax can be recovered. In these countries, tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely. Nevertheless, after analyzing each situation, the Group may decide not to recognize them.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, deferred tax assets whose recovery is not considered probable totaled \u20ac299/uni00A0million (December/uni00A031, 2020: \u20ac374/uni00A0million) and a provision had been accrued for the full amount. Unrecognized deferred tax assets chiefly relate to France, China, Germany, Spain and the United States.\n\nIn light of the improved situation in France, \u20ac53/uni00A0million of the \u20ac60/uni00A0million provision recognized at December/uni00A031, 2020 was written back in 2021.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "## Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated 2. financial statements\n\n## For the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021\n\nThis is a translation into English of the statutory auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.\n\nThis statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the management report and other documents provided to shareholders.\n\nThis report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain ('the Group') for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December/uni00A031, 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Risk Committee .\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January/uni00A01, 2021 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article/uni00A05(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe  carrying  amounts  of  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  property,  plant  &  equipment  were  significant  at December/uni00A031,/uni00A02021,  representing  \u20ac11,181/uni00A0million,  \u20ac2,705/uni00A0million  and  \u20ac11,663/uni00A0million,  respectively.  These  assets  may  be impaired due to internal or external factors, including decisions to change the Group's strategy in certain markets, a decline in Group performance, the Group's commitments to carbon neutrality, changes in competition, unfavorable market conditions particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and changes in legislation or regulations. These changes are likely to have an impact on the Group's forecast cash flow and, consequently, the assets' recoverable amounts.\n\nThe impairment tests performed by Management using the method described in Note/uni00A07.5 to the consolidated financial statements led to the recognition of impairment losses of \u20ac213/uni00A0million in the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021 (including impairment on assets held for sale), as indicated in Note/uni00A05 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements\n\nDetermining the assets' recoverable amounts is a key audit matter given the potentially significant nature of any impairment and the high degree of estimation and judgment required by Management in assessing impairment losses. Management exercises judgment when making assumptions regarding future changes in sales (in both volume and value terms), profitability, investments and the other cash flows required to operate the assets, and when determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to future cash flows.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe familiarized ourselves with the procedures implemented within the Group for impairment testing purposes particularly with regard to take into account the impacts of the Group's commitments to carbon neutrality, and tested the effectiveness of the controls implemented by the Group to ensure the quality and reliability of the aforementioned procedures and their consistency with data from the budget and the medium-term business plan prepared by Management.\n\nWe also assessed the consistency and relevance of Management's approach to determine the cash-generating units for asset impairment testing. We adapted our audit approach to the risk of impairment, which varies depending on the cash-generating unit.\n\nOur valuation specialists performed an independent analysis of certain key assumptions used by Management for impairment testing purposes, in particular the discount rate, by referring to both external market data and comparable company analyses.\n\nFor a selection of cash-generating units, we analyzed the consistency of future cash flow projections with regard to past performance and our knowledge of the business, confirmed by interviews with the Heads of the relevant Segments and Businesses and qualitative and quantitative parameters relating to the depth and potential duration of the health crisis triggered by Covid-19.\n\nWe carefully examined the calculation of the normalized amount of the terminal cash flows projected to perpetuity. We performed our own sensitivity analyses of certain key variables of the measurement model, particularly with regard to take into account the impacts of the Group's commitments to carbon neutrality, to assess the materiality of their potential impact on the recoverable amounts of the most high-risk assets.\n\nWe verified that the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on the measurement of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment, the underlying assumptions and sensitivity analyses were appropriate and in particular that, given the context related to Covid-19, the sensitivity ranges communicated have remained extended.\n\n## Measurement of provisions for liabilities and litigation related to asbestos\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to various legal risks, including asbestos-related litigation in the United States.\n\nAs indicated in Note/uni00A09 to the consolidated financial statements, provisions amounting to \u20ac1,349/uni00A0million were recognized at December/uni00A031, 2021 for contingent liabilities and litigation. Significant contingent liabilities, whose amount or timing cannot be estimated with sufficient reliability, are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWith regard to asbestos-related risks in the United States, determining and measuring the provisions recognized for contingent liabilities and litigation and assessing the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are a key audit matter given the amounts involved and the high degree of estimation and judgment required by Management in determining those provisions. Judgment is required, in particular, to assess the status and resolution of the ongoing legal proceedings (in particular the voluntary petition for relief under Chapter/uni00A011 in the United States): duration, cost, estimation of the number of current and future cases covered, definition of the damages by the judicial authority, etc.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nTo obtain an understanding of contingent liabilities and litigation regarding asbestos in the United States and the related judgments made, we held discussions with Management and lawyers chosen by Management, at the Group and country level as well as at the main subsidiaries concerned. We also contacted certain law firms and external experts chosen by Management to assist them with the monitoring of these risks.\n\n## We:\n\n- examined the minutes of the Board of Directors' meetings and the Group's risk mapping prepared by Management and /uni25A0 presented to the Audit and Risk Committee;\n- familiarized ourselves with the procedures implemented by Management when measuring the provisions for /uni25A0 asbestos-related risks in the United States and determining the disclosures thereon in the notes to the consolidated financial statements;\n- assessed the permanence of methods and performed a critical review of internal analyses relating to the probability /uni25A0 and possible impact of these contingent liabilities and new items of litigation by examining the available information relating to the proceedings (correspondence, judgments, notifications, etc.). We also reviewed the responses to the confirmation letters of the law firms chosen by Management, particularly in terms of their experience at resolving comparable situations in the past. We also used our professional judgment to assess the positions adopted by Management, to see where they fell within risk assessment ranges and the consistency of those positions over time;\n- verified the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations of changes in provisions and the consistency of the main items of /uni25A0 change in relation to the underlying data, in particular the payments made during the year in respect of these risks.\n\nWe assessed if the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding these items of litigation and contingent liabilities identified.",

This  information  should  be  reported  by  an independent third party.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed  by  the  statutory  auditor  relating  to  the  annual  and  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article/uni00A0L.451-1-2,/uni00A0I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code mon\u00e9taire et financier), prepared unde the responsibility of the General Manager, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation N\u00b0 2019/815 of 17 Decembre 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed Statutory Auditors of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain by the Shareholders' Meeting held on June/uni00A026, 1986 for Petiteau Scacchi and subsequently PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on June/uni00A010, 2004 for KPMG Audit.\n\nAt  December/uni00A031,  2021  PricewaterhouseCoopers  Audit  and  KPMG  Audit  were  respectively  in  the  thirty-sixth  and eighteenth consecutive year of their engagement, respectively.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\n8",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are /uni25A0 appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related /uni25A0 disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit /uni25A0 evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements /uni25A0 represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities /uni25A0 within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Risk Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Risk Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risk Committee with the declaration provided for in Article/uni00A06 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles/uni00A0L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors . Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Risk Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris La D\u00e9fense, February/uni00A024, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nEdouard Sattler\n\nKPMG Audit Department of KPMG/uni00A0SA\n\nPierre-Antoine Duffaud Bertrand Pruvost",

Accordingly, at that date, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain reduced the provision for retirement bonuses by \u20ac226/uni00A0thousand against an increase in retained earnings for the same amount.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are carried at acquisition cost (including incidental expenses) and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to ten years.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition cost (purchase price plus incidental expenses). They are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The most commonly used useful lives are as follows:\n\n- Buildings /uni25A0\n\n40/uni00A0to 50/uni00A0years Straight-line\n\n- Improvements and additions /uni25A0\n\n12/uni00A0years Straight-line\n\n- Fixtures and fittings /uni25A0\n\n5 to 12/uni00A0years Straight-line\n\n- Office furniture /uni25A0\n\n10/uni00A0years Straight-line\n\n- Office equipment /uni25A0\n\n5/uni00A0years Straight-line\n\n- Vehicles /uni25A0\n\n4/uni00A0years Straight-line\n\n- IT equipment /uni25A0\n\n3/uni00A0years Straight-line\n\n## Financial investments\n\nOn initial recognition, investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are stated at cost including incidental expenses. Periodically, and particularly when an inventory is performed, the net carrying amount of the investments is compared with their fair value (value in use). Fair value is estimated based on various criteria: the Company's equity in the underlying net assets, proportion of consolidated net assets, net present value of future cash flows, excluding interest expense but after tax, based on business plans (or long-term budget projections), or a multiple of a normative performance basis.\n\nWhen the fair value of the investments falls below their carrying amount, a provision is set aside for impairment. No unrealized capital gain is recorded if their fair value exceeds their carrying amount, and unrealized capital gains and losses are not offset.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares held by the Company for cancellation are recorded in the balance sheet under 'Other investment securities'. They are carried at acquisition cost and are not revalued or provisioned.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, treasury shares held by the Company for allocation upon exercise of stock options are recorded in the balance sheet under 'Marketable securities'.\n\nTreasury shares held by the Company for allocation under performance share plans are also recorded in the balance sheet under 'Marketable securities'. These shares are valued in accordance with the first in/first out (FIFO) method, and are not revalued or provisioned.",

        "page_content": "Where  appropriate,  a  provision  for  contingencies  and charges is recognized in respect of these plans, corresponding to the outflow of resources expected by the Company. This is calculated based on the number of shares likely to be delivered to the beneficiaries and the acquisition  cost  of  the  shares  at  the  date  they  are allocated to the plan or the likely cost of repurchasing the shares as measured at the reporting date. The provision is recognized on a pro rata basis over the vesting period.\n\n## Receivables\n\nReceivables are stated at nominal value. A provision is set aside for impairment when their realizable value is less than their book value.\n\n## Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities mainly include units in money market funds (OPCVM and FCP) and are stated at the lower of acquisition cost and market value at year-end.\n\nTreasury  shares  other  than  those  classified  as  financial investments  are  also  classified  as  marketable  securities (see 'Treasury shares' above).\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nIncome and expenses in foreign currencies are recorded at the euro exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Receivables,  payables  and  bank  balances  in  foreign currencies are translated at the year-end exchange rate, along with the related hedging instruments, and differences  arising  on  translation  are  recorded  under translation gains or losses. Provisions are booked for any exceptional  unrealized  translation  losses  that  are  not hedged.\n\n## Risk management/Financial instruments\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  managed  with  the  main  objective  of ensuring the timely rollover of the Group's financing at an optimal  cost.  Long-term  debt  therefore  systematically represents a high proportion of overall debt. At the same time, the maturity schedules of long-term debt are set in\n\nsuch a way that replacement capital market issues are spread over time.\n\nCurrency, interest rate and commodity (energy and raw material price) risks arising from the Group's international operations  are  hedged  by  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain, mainly on behalf of subsidiaries. Currency risk is primarily hedged through forward purchase and sale contracts and currency options, while interest rate risk is hedged mainly through swaps and cross-currency swaps.\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain applies regulation no./uni00A02015-05 of July/uni00A02, 2015 issued by the French accounting standards-setter ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables - ANC) on forward financial instruments and hedging operations.\n\n## Pension obligations\n\nThe Company's obligations under supplementary pension plans and retirement bonuses are measured by independent  actuaries  using  the  projected  unit  credit method (based on final salary and benefit obligations as determined at the measurement date). Pension obligations are  included  within  provisions  for  contingencies  and charges.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  arising  in  the  year  under defined-benefit retirement plans are recognized immediately and in full in the income statement.\n\n## Tax consolidation agreements\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain is the parent company of a tax  consolidation  group  under  the  group  relief  regime provided for in Articles/uni00A0223 A et seq. of the French Tax Code.\n\nThe tax consolidation agreements between Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and its subsidiaries provide for tax neutrality for  consolidated  subsidiaries.  In  their  relationship  with Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain,  the  consolidating  parent company, the subsidiaries discharge their taxes as if they had been taxed on a stand-alone basis. When loss-making companies  leave  the  Group,  they  are  not,  in  principle, entitled  to  any  payments  for  losses  transferred  to  the consolidating  parent  company  during  the  consolidation period.\n\n## Operating income/(loss) NOTE 2\n\nThe operating loss improved by \u20ac19/uni00A0million compared to 2020, due mainly to a reduction in pension and other employee benefit costs.\n\n8",

Dividends received from subsidiaries rose by \u20ac96/uni00A0million to\n\n## Exceptional items NOTE 4\n\nThe Company recorded a net exceptional expense of \u20ac68/uni00A0million in 2021 compared to a net exceptional expense of \u20ac2/uni00A0million in 2020. The net/uni00A0exceptional expense in 2021\n\nis mainly due to the increase in provisions for the Group's long-term compensation plans following the rise in the Saint-Gobain share price.\n\n## Income taxes NOTE 5\n\nThe Company recorded an income tax benefit of \u20ac261/uni00A0million, breaking down as:\n\n- an income tax benefit of \u20ac281/uni00A0million under the tax /uni25A0 consolidation regime (France);\n- an income tax expense of \u20ac20/uni00A0million for the German /uni25A0 entity.\n\nThe French tax group generated a tax profit in 2021. 50% of the 2021 tax profit is therefore charged against tax losses carried forward from prior years. Total cumulative\n\ntax losses (including losses arising from tax rules on the deductibility of financial expenses) were estimated at \u20ac802/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain's permanent German establishment is the head of the Group's Organschaft local tax consolidation regime.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, future tax savings corresponding to the branch's unused tax loss carry-forwards amounted to \u20ac27/uni00A0million.\n\n## Intangible assets NOTE 6\n\n|                               | Intangible assets     | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets         | Intangible assets                                | Amortization           | Amortization                  | Amortization   | Net value           | Net value                      | Net value        |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|\n| (in EUR million)              | Gross at Jan. 1, 2021 | Additions           | Disposals (retire- ments) | Transfer of intangible assets under construction | Gross at Dec. 31, 2021 | Accumu- lated at Jan. 1, 2021 |                | Increases Decreases | Accumu- lated at Dec. 31, 2021 | at Dec. 31, 2021 |\n| Purchased goodwill            | 1                     |                     |                           |                                                  | 1                      | 1                             |                |                     | 1                              |                  |\n| Other intangible assets       | 56                    |                     |                           |                                                  | 56                     | 47                            | 3              |                     | 50                             | 6                |\n| Intangible assets in progress |                       |                     |                           |                                                  |                        |                               |                |                     |                                |                  |\n| TOTAL                         | 56                    | 0                   | 0                         | 0                                                | 57                     | 48                            | 3              | 0                   | 51                             | 6                |\n\n\u20ac815/uni00A0million in 2021, while 2021 profit transferred from subsidiaries of the German branch increased by \u20ac141/uni00A0million.

\u20ac412/uni00A0million capital reduction at SG Benelux, the \u20ac1,100/uni00A0million capital increase at SG Europe du Nord and the \u20ac200/uni00A0million capital increase at Partidis.\n\nMost loans and advances to subsidiaries and affiliates are due in more than one year.\n\nMovements in other investment securities correspond mainly to treasury shares (see the section below).\n\nIn 2021, the change in provisions for impairment of investments is mainly due to a write-back of \u20ac345/uni00A0million from the provision, including \u20ac333/uni00A0million relating to SG Europe du Nord and \u20ac12/uni00A0million to SG Innovative Materials Belgium.\n\n8",

May/uni00A02021 increase in capital stock through the /uni25A0 subscription of 5,562,855/uni00A0shares under the Group Savings Plan at a price of \u20ac35.81 for a gross and net amount of \u20ac199/uni00A0million;\n- the capital reductions of June/uni00A011, 2021 and /uni25A0 November/uni00A030, 2021 through the cancellation of 5,700,000 and 8,543,174/uni00A0shares, respectively, for a total gross and net amount of \u20ac794/uni00A0million.\n\n## Stock option plans 12.2\n\nUntil 2018, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain operated stock option plans for certain employees.\n\nUnder these plans, the Board of Directors granted options allowing beneficiaries to obtain Saint-Gobain shares at a price set, at no discount, by reference to the average of the opening prices for the Saint-Gobain share over the 20/uni00A0stock market trading days preceding the date of the decision by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2021, 1,471,779/uni00A0shares were purchased under this agreement (2020: 1,847,040/uni00A0shares) and 1,483,669/uni00A0shares were sold (2020: 1,847,233/uni00A0shares).\n\n## Deferred charges\n\nDeferred charges mainly correspond to bond issuance costs for \u20ac31/uni00A0million (\u20ac40/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nIn 2021, new debt issuance costs recorded under 'Deferred charges' totaled \u20ac0.5/uni00A0million (2020: \u20ac21.3/uni00A0million) and amortization for the year amounted to \u20ac10.7/uni00A0million (2020: \u20ac21.3/uni00A0million).

Eligible employees must have completed a  minimum  of  three  months'  service  with  the  Group. Eligible  employees  are  able  to  invest  in  Saint-Gobain shares at a preferential subscription price. These shares are held either directly or through the employee saving plan's mutual funds, depending on local legislation, and are subject to a mandatory five- or ten-year lock-up, except following the occurrence of certain events. The Board of Directors delegates authorization for setting the subscription  price  to  the  Chief  executive  officer  of Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain.  It  corresponds  to  the average of the opening prices for the Saint-Gobain share on Euronext Paris over the 20 trading days preceding the date  of  the  decision,  subject  to  a  20%  discount,  in accordance  with  applicable  laws, the Shareholders' Meeting Resolutions and the deliberations of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2021, 5,562,855 new shares with a par value of \u20ac4 were issued  to  employees  under  the  PEG  at  an  average subscription price of \u20ac35.81 (2020: 6,099,996/uni00A0shares at an average price of \u20ac23.03), representing a total share capital increase of \u20ac199/uni00A0million (\u20ac140/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\n## Potential number of shares 12.6\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A06, 2019, shareholders authorized  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain to:\n\n- grant stock purchase or subscription options /uni25A0 exercisable  for  new  or  existing  shares,  subject  in particular to performance conditions, representing up to 1.5% of capital stock on the date of the Shareholders' Meeting,  with  a  sub-limit  of  10%  of  this  limit  for corporate officers of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, i.e. , 8,288,775/uni00A0options, including a maximum of 828,878/uni00A0options for corporate officers (23rd/uni00A0Resolution/38-month authorization commencing June/uni00A06, 2019). It should be noted that this limit of 1.5% of the capital stock will be set off against the threshold set in the 24th/uni00A0Resolution for the performance share grants  mentioned  below,  and  that  this  1.5%  limit represents the aggregate limit for shares resulting from the exercise of options granted under and within the limit of the 23rd/uni00A0Resolution and shares granted under and within the limit of the 24th/uni00A0Resolution;\n- grant  free  existing  shares,  subject  in  particular  to /uni25A0 performance conditions, representing up to 1.2% of the capital stock on the date of the Shareholders' Meeting, with  a  sub-limit  of  10%  of  this  limit  for  corporate officers of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, i.e. , 6,631,020 free shares, including a maximum of 663,102 free shares for corporate officers (24th/uni00A0Resolution/38-month authorization commencing June/uni00A06, 2019). The limit of 1.2% and sub-limit of 10% are being set off against the limits specified  under  the  23rd/uni00A0Resolution of the Shareholders'  Meeting  referred  to  above  regarding stock options. The Board of Directors made partial use of this authorization by granting 1,268,295 performance shares  (including  147,500  for  corporate  officers)  on November/uni00A024, 2020, and 1,184,475 performance shares (including 64,000 for corporate officers) on November/uni00A025, 2021 (see Note/uni00A012.3).\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A03, 2021, shareholders authorized  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain to:\n\n- issue, on one or several occasions, up to 106,500,000 /uni25A0 new  shares  or  securities  giving  access  to  the  share capital  of  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries,  with preferential subscription rights, or without preferential subscription  rights  but  with  a  priority  period  for existing  shareholders,  by  public  offering,  or  without preferential subscription rights by private placement, or to issue new shares through the capitalization of share premiums,  reserves,  profits  or  other  amounts,  or without preferential subscription rights in consideration of  contributions  in  kind  (18th/uni00A0to  23th  Resolutions/ 26-month authorization commencing June/uni00A03, 2021);\n- issue, on one or several occasions, up to 13,000,000 /uni25A0 new  shares  to  members  of  the  Group  Savings  Plan (25th/uni00A0Resolution/26-month  authorization  commencing June/uni00A03, 2021).\n\nIf all outstanding stock options whose type has not yet been  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  were  to  be exercised via the  issue  of  new  shares,  this  would potentially have the effect of increasing the number of shares outstanding to 524,313,527/uni00A0shares. In addition, if the authorizations described above were to be used in full by the Board of Directors, this would potentially have the effect of increasing the number of shares outstanding to 648,397,762/uni00A0shares.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "## Financial and accounting/uni00A0information\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain 2021 annual financial statements (parent company)\n\nLong-term debt can be analyzed as follows by currency:\n\n| (in EUR million)   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Euro               | 9,026  | 10,541 |\n| Pound sterling     | 660    | 617    |\n| TOTAL              | 9,686  | 11,158 |\n\nThe amortization of expenses incurred to set up borrowings is recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the borrowings in question. These expenses are shown on the 'Deferred charges' line of the balance sheet (see Note/uni00A011 'Deferred charges').\n\n## Perpetual bonds 15.1\n\nIn 1985, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain issued 25,000 perpetual bonds with a face value of ECU 5,000 (\u20ac5,000/uni00A0today).\n\nA total of 18,496 perpetual bonds have since been bought back and canceled, and 6,504 perpetual bonds are outstanding at December/uni00A031, 2021, representing a total face value of \u20ac33/uni00A0million.\n\nThe bonds bear interest at a variable rate (average of interbank rates offered by the five reference banks for six-month euro deposits). The amount paid out per bond in 2021 was \u20ac0.\n\nThe bonds are not redeemable and interest on the bonds is classified as a component of finance costs.\n\n## Financing programs 15.3\n\nThe Group has a number of medium- and long-term financing programs (Medium-Term Notes) and short-term financing programs (Commercial Paper).\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the state of these programs was as follows:\n\n| (in EUR millions)     | Authorized drawings    | Authorized limits at Dec. 31, 2021   | Balance outstanding at Dec. 31, 2021   | Balance outstanding at Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Medium-Term Notes     | any duration           | 15,000                               | 9,649                                  | 11,149                                 |\n| NEU CP                | up to 12/uni00A0months | 4,000                                | 0                                      | 0                                      |\n| US Commercial Paper   | up to 12/uni00A0months | 883*                                 | 0                                      | 0                                      |\n| Euro Commercial Paper | up to 12/uni00A0months | 883*                                 | 0                                      | 0                                      |\n\nIn accordance with market practices, Negotiable European Commercial Paper (NEU CP), US Commercial Paper and Euro Commercial Paper are generally issued with maturities of one to six months. They are treated as variable-rate debt since they are rolled over at frequent intervals.\n\n## Syndicated lines of credit\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain has two syndicated lines of credit that are intended to provide a secure source of financing for the Group (including as additional backing for its NEU CP, US Commercial Paper and Euro Commercial Paper programs):\n\n- a \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion syndicated line of credit, maturing in /uni25A0 December/uni00A02024 after the exercise of the two one-year rollover options;\n- a second \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion syndicated line of credit, also /uni25A0 maturing in December/uni00A02024 after the exercise of the two one-year rollover options.\n\nBased on the Group's current credit rating for long-term debt issues, the two facilities are not subject to any covenants. Neither of these two lines of credit had been drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## Main changes in bond debt 15.2 in 2020\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain also redeemed the following instruments at maturity:\n\n- a \u20ac750/uni00A0million private placement paying variable-rate /uni25A0 interest at 3-month Euribor +0.35% on March/uni00A022, 2021;\n- \u20ac750/uni00A0million worth of 3.625% bonds on June/uni00A015, 2021. /uni25A0",

Violation of competition law exposes the Group to fines and, in certain countries, potential criminal sanctions on the Group and its employees involved. Any litigation filed by a competition authority could, in the event of conviction, give rise to the payment of fines and potentially damages, which is likely to have significant impact on the Group's reputation, financial position and operating results.\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group is firmly committed to opposing any practice that might violate competition rules and has\n\nNon-audit services provided by the Statutory Auditors to Compagnie de Saint-Gobain relate mainly to audit procedures carried out as an independent third party on the management report on CSR information, due diligence in the context of planned acquisitions or divestments, and procedures related to the issuance of comfort letters in the case of new bond issues.\n\n## Management compensation\n\nTotal gross compensation and benefits paid in 2021 by the French and foreign companies in the Group to members of the Executive Committee as it stood at December/uni00A031, 2021 (excluding any long-term compensation) amounted to \u20ac14.2/uni00A0million (2020: \u20ac13.3/uni00A0million), including \u20ac5.5/uni00A0million in gross variable compensation (2020: \u20ac5.2/uni00A0million).\n\nProvisions for pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations (defined-benefit obligations [DBO] in respect of length-of-service awards and pensions) accruing to Group management totaled \u20ac31.0/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020:/uni00A0\u20ac46.3/uni00A0million). The decrease in this item reflects changes during the year as well as the transfer of obligations to a third-party insurer falling within the scope of Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0137-11 of the French Social Security Code, as taken up in the PACTE Law.\n\nCompensation paid to members of the Board of Directors for 2021 totaled \u20ac1.1/uni00A0million (2020: \u20ac1.0/uni00A0million).\n\nlong applied the principle of zero tolerance.

In May/uni00A02014, the Commission Secretariat issued a notice of complaints against Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other things, agreed in 2005 and 2012 to lower gross prices.\n\n8",

However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December/uni00A031, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged as at December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## Investigation by the French Competition Authority in the building insulation products industry\n\nOn July/uni00A028, 2014, the French Competition Authority sent a statement of objections to Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (as parent company of the Saint-Gobain Group). A hearing took place on May/uni00A011, 2016, whereupon the Competition Authority sent the case back for further investigation in light of the arguments put forward by Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. In October/uni00A02018, Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain received a second statement of objections, in which the Competition Authority alleges anti-competitive practices in the building insulation products market, between 2001 and 2013.\n\nSaint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain rejected the allegations in their response to the second statement of objections filed in January/uni00A02019.\n\nA new report was sent by the Authority at the end of 2019, which gave rise to comments in response from Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain on February/uni00A011, 2020.\n\nThe hearing before the Competition Authority was held on October/uni00A06, 2020. By decision dated January/uni00A014, 2021, the French Competition Authority considered that the alleged anti-competitive practices were not established and dismissed all the objections notified.\n\nActis appealed this decision to the Paris Court of Appeal on February/uni00A026, 2021, following which the other parties including Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain filed incidental appeals. Hearing is expected to occur end of 2022.\n\nOn the civil law front, Actis served in March/uni00A02013 a damages claim on Saint-Gobain Isover, the Centre scientifique et technique du b\u00e2timent, and the FILMM before the Paris Civil Court (Tribunal judiciaire de Paris) based on the facts being investigated by the Competition Authority. A stay of proceedings has been declared and following the dismissal decided by the Competition Authority and the appeal filed by Actis against such dismissal, Actis requested that the proceeding remain stayed until the Paris Court of Appeal's decision to be made in relation to the appeal filed by Actis against the dismissal decision of the Competition Authority.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation 20.2\n\nCurrent legal actions related to asbestos are described below.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation in France\n\n## Inexcusable fault lawsuits\n\nIn France, where Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM had carried out fiber-cement operations in the past, seven additional lawsuits to those brought since 1996 were filed in 2021 by former employees (or persons claiming through them) for recognition of inexcusable fault resulting from exposure for asbestos-related occupational diseases.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, a total of 844 lawsuits had been issued against the two companies since 1996 with the aim of obtaining supplementary compensation over and above the amounts paid by the French Social Security authorities in this respect.\n\nAs of the same date, 812 of these 844 lawsuits had been completed, the employer's inexcusable fault having been upheld in all of these cases. 32 actions are still pending against Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM.\n\nCompensation paid by Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM since the outset of these litigations in settlement of these lawsuits totaled approximately \u20ac6.6/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (compared to \u20ac6.2/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nIn addition, as of December/uni00A031, 2021, a total of 272 similar suits had been filed since the outset of the litigation by current or former employees, or persons claiming through them, of 13 French companies of the Group (excluding suits against companies that are no longer part of the Group), in particular by current or former employees who in the past used equipment containing asbestos to protect themselves against heat from furnaces.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, 230 of this 272 lawsuits had been completed, with the employer's inexcusable fault having been upheld in 147 of them. 42 actions were still pending at the same date.\n\nThe total amount of compensation paid since the outset of the litigation by these companies was approximately \u20ac10.5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (compared to approximately \u20ac8.7/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## Anxiety claims\n\nEight of the Group's subsidiaries, including six that operate or have operated facilities in France classified as containing asbestos, were the subject of anxiety claims.\n\n'Facilities classified as containing asbestos' are defined as industrial facilities, that have been closed or are still operating, which previously manufactured materials containing asbestos or used protection and insulation equipment containing asbestos and that are included by ministerial decree on the official list of facilities whose current or former employees are entitled to the early-retirement benefit paid to asbestos workers (ACAATA).\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, a total of 824 lawsuits had been brought by current or former employees - benefiting from ACAATA or not - claiming compensation for prejudice of anxiety suffered as a result of their alleged exposure to asbestos. These 824 suits have all been definitely completed, representing a total amount of compensation of \u20ac8.5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (compared to \u20ac7.6/uni00A0million as at December/uni00A031, 2020).",

        "page_content": "It should be clarified that the above figures do not take into  account  suits  filed  against  companies  that  are  no longer part of the Group.\n\nThe  provision  related  to  asbestos-related  litigation  in France amounted to around \u20ac6.9/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021  (compared  to  \u20ac5.5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## Situation in the United States\n\n## Action taken to achieve equitable and permanent Resolution of the former CertainTeed Corporation's legacy asbestos liabilities in the United States\n\nDBMP/uni00A0LLC, an affiliate of CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC based in North Carolina, that holds the legacy asbestos liabilities of the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  filed,  on  January/uni00A023, 2020, a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter/uni00A011 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Western  District  of  North  Carolina  in  Charlotte.  The purpose  of  the  filing  is  to  achieve  a  certain,  final  and equitable resolution of all current and future claims arising from asbestos-containing products manufactured and sold by the former CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP/uni00A0LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under Section/uni00A0524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve a fair and equitable resolution of its asbestos-related  liabilities.  Upon  establishment  of  the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will  be  able  to  receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims without the delay, stress and uncertainty of litigation in the tort system; at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally resolve DBMP/uni00A0LLC's asbestos liability.\n\nDuring the course of this bankruptcy process, which is expected to take approximately three to eight years, all asbestos  litigation  will  be  stayed  and  all  related  costs suspended,  providing  DBMP/uni00A0LLC  with  the  time  and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\nThis action was taken as a result of the increasing risks presented in the US tort system. Despite the passage of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity for claimants to assert legitimate claims of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former CertainTeed Corporation, naming practices in the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims  against  DBMP/uni00A0LLC,  with  no  foreseeable  end  in sight. In addition, there has been, in general, an escalation of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\n## Impact on the Group's financial statements\n\nFollowing the commencement of the proceeding under Chapter/uni00A011  of  the  US  Bankruptcy  Code  on  January/uni00A023, 2020, the assets and liabilities of DBMP/uni00A0LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary Millwork & Panel/uni00A0LLC, and in particular the provision for asbestos-related litigation in the United States, are no longer consolidated in the Group's financial statements.\n\nNonetheless,  because  of  a  funding  agreement  between CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC and DBMP/uni00A0LLC by which CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC  has  agreed  to  fund  the  costs  of  the Chapter/uni00A011 case and, ultimately, the 524(g) trust, in both cases solely to the extent DBMP/uni00A0LLC is unable to do so in full, the  Group  recorded  in  its  consolidated  financial statements  a  debt  against  DBMP/uni00A0LLC  amounting  to $417/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nThe Group's consolidated income for 2021 is not impacted by the ongoing Chapter/uni00A011 proceeding described above.\n\nAs a result of this bankruptcy proceeding, all legal costs and indemnity payments related to DBMP/uni00A0LLC's asbestos tort claims have been suspended, and no further charges in relation to such claims have been taken in 2021 (as in 2020).\n\n## Situation in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, former  employees  of  Brasilit, that once manufactured fiber cement containing asbestos, suffering from asbestos-related occupational illnesses are offered, depending  on  the  case,  either  financial  compensation alone  or  lifetime  medical  assistance  combined  with financial compensation. Around 1,200/uni00A0contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambouc  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  First  and second instance decisions were rendered in connection with the first suit respectively in July/uni00A02020 and July/uni00A02021, rejecting  the  claims  of  the  plaintiffs.  The  latter  have nevertheless appealed the second instance decision. The suit related to Recife is still at an early stage and there is no court decision issued so far.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari  (State  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo)  by  the  Labor  prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages, in favor of employees, former employees and their respective families, as well as subcontractors who were exposed to asbestos. A first instance decision was rendered  in  September/uni00A02020  partly  in  favor  of  the plaintiffs.  In  particular,  collective  moral  damages  were granted to the plaintiffs, for an amount reduced to BRL 5/uni00A0million (\u20ac0.8/uni00A0million). Brasilit has appealed the decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues to comply with all of its legal obligations with regard to medical assistance for its current and former employees.\n\nIn November/uni00A02017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## Environmental disputes 20.3\n\n## PFOA matters in the United States\n\nLevels of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) in excess of US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or state maximum contaminant levels for drinking water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells  near  current  Saint-Gobain  Performance  Plastics (SG  PPL)  facilities  in  Hoosick  Falls  (New  York)  and Merrimack (New Hampshire), and two former facilities in North Bennington (Vermont) in the United States. PFOA and  PTFE  (polytetrafluorethylene)  have  never  been manufactured by these plants. SG PPL is a processor of PTFE which it purchases from third-party suppliers and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\n8",

In addition, it has voluntarily funded construction of water line extensions in certain communities in the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are ongoing and the scope of responsibility for SG PPL arising from environmental remediation in New Hampshire and New York and clean-up obligations at these sites has not yet been established. The scope of the remediation in Vermont is defined and largely completed; future operation and maintenance obligations remain. Without admitting liability, SG PPL has signed consent orders with the environmental regulators in New York in 2016, in Vermont in 2017 and 2019 with respect to two different areas, and in New Hampshire in 2018, pursuant to which SG PPL has agreed to complete investigations, implement interim or final remediation measures at its current and former facilities and in the case of Vermont and New Hampshire, fund construction of water lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related lawsuits alleging both health-related and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of proposed or certified class actions. It is difficult to predict the timing or outcome of any such litigation, or whether any additional litigation will be brought against SG PPL, however, both the New York and Vermont class actions have signed settlements, the Vermont settlement remaining under final review by the courts.\n\nOn December/uni00A031, 2021, the provision recorded by the Company in respect of this matter amounts to \u20ac116/uni00A0million (compared to \u20ac31/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020). This provision covers fully the amount of the New York and Vermont class action settlements, as well as various other costs related to PFOA matters including remediation works.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities 20.4\n\n## Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom\n\nCelotex provides insulation materials for specific applications for the building and construction industry.\n\nInsulation materials from two Celotex ranges were purchased via distributors and used in refurbishing\n\nGrenfell Tower, London in 2015/2016, including as one component of the rainscreen cladding system designed and installed (by third parties) on the tower's external facade.\n\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower fire on June/uni00A014, 2017, a Public Inquiry is underway, which is considering, among other things, the modifications made to the building as part of the refurbishment, the role played by the various construction professionals, and the information provided by the manufacturers of the products used. The Inquiry is conducting its work in two phases: its phase/uni00A01 report was published on October/uni00A030, 2019, phase/uni00A02 commenced in January/uni00A02020 - public hearings are expected to continue until July/uni00A02022, with a final report to follow some time thereafter. A criminal investigation into the circumstances of the fire is also in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the implications for Celotex are unlikely to be known for some time. Civil proceedings in connection with Grenfell Tower brought against Celotex Limited and/or Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK Limited (which respectively held the Celotex business until or after December/uni00A031, 2015) and a number of other defendants - who are also core participants in the Public Inquiry - have been issued and are stayed prior to the service of full pleadings. No figure has yet been put on the quantum claimed.\n\nThe extent to which Celotex may incur civil or criminal liability in connection with the production, marketing, supply or use of its products is currently unclear and Celotex Limited and Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## Other proceedings and disputes 20.5\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other claims made by their employees or by the tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses. Apart from the proceedings and litigation described above, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no other government, court or arbitration proceedings exist (including pending proceedings or proceedings where the Company and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had, in the last 12/uni00A0months, a significant impact on the financial position or profitability of the Company and/or Group.",

Basis for opinion\n\n## Audit framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January/uni00A01, 2021 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article/uni00A05(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw attention to the following matter described in Note/uni00A01 'Accounting principles and methods' to the financial statements relating to the change in the method for calculating certain retirement benefits following the first application of the IFRIC's decision issued in May/uni00A02021 regarding the rules for measuring and recognizing pension and other benefit obligations. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## 2. Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.",

        "page_content": "These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances\n\n## Description of risk\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the carrying amount of the Company's investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances stood at \u20ac26,603/uni00A0million, representing 78% of the net assets of the company. Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are initially stated at cost and are impaired based on their value in use, corresponding to the amount the Company would be prepared to pay for the investment if it were to acquire it. A decline in the performance of certain subsidiaries or affiliates or risks relating to the international locations of those companies could lead to impairment losses.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of the value in use of these investments, which is performed each year by Management using the multi-criteria approach described in Note/uni00A01 to the financial statements, to be a key audit matter in light of the potential materiality of any impairment and the high degree of estimation and judgment required from Management to assess impairment losses, especially in the context of Covid-19's crisis. Management's judgment is based in part on assumptions relating, on the one hand, to the multiples applicable to the valuation of the investments and, on the other, to future changes in the cash flows relating to the investments, as well as to the calculation of the appropriate discount rate applied to future cash flows.\n\nThe impairment tests performed by Management have led to book a reversal of impairment amounting to \u20ac345/uni00A0million and impairment losses amounting to \u20ac1/uni00A0million for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe examined the impairment test procedure applied by the Company's financial management team, especially the consideration of the impacts of the Covid's 19 health crisis, verified the consistency of the method used and tested the effectiveness of the controls implemented by Management to ensure the quality and reliability of the procedure.\n\nWe carried out an independent analysis of certain key assumptions used by Management to perform the tests, pertaining, as appropriate, to the multiple deemed applicable to the valuation of the investments or to the discount rate and average perpetual  growth  rate  used  to  project  future  cash  flows,  referring  both  to  external  market  data  and  analyses  of comparable companies.\n\nFor each investment selected for our tests of detail, we corroborated the calculation parameters applied in Management's multi-criteria approach with the accounting and budget data available for that investment. Where projected future cash flows were used, we analyzed the consistency of the projections with past performance and our knowledge of the Company's business, supported by interviews with managers from the various businesses, we also analyzed qualitative and quantitative parameters related to the depth and the potential length of the Covid-19's crisis and, in so far as they were available, external data relating to markets or competitors. We paid particularly close attention to the calculation of the normalized amount of the terminal cash flows projected to perpetuity.\n\nWe verified the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements concerning the valuation of investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances to ensure their appropriateness.\n\n## 3. Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to the payment deadlines mentioned in Article/uni00A0D.441-4 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe  attest  that  the  Board  of  Directors'  report  on  corporate  governance  sets  out  the  information  required  by Articles/uni00A0L.225-37-4, L.22-10-10 and L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article/uni00A0L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlling and controlled companies. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article/uni00A0L.22 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us.

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, /uni25A0 designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are /uni25A0 appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the /uni25A0 underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Risk Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur  report  to  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  includes  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional judgment, were the most significant for the audit of the financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risk Committee with the declaration provided for in article/uni00A06 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in articles/uni00A0L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors.

The  company  employs  1,300/uni00A0people and  generates approximately  \u20ac400/uni00A0million  in  annual  sales  and  around \u20ac85/uni00A0million in Ebitda.\n\nThe enterprise value of just over \u20ac1/uni00A0billion represents a multiple  of  12.0x  Chryso's  last  12/uni00A0months'  Ebitda  of \u20ac85/uni00A0million and a multiple of 7.6x post run-rate synergies of \u20ac50/uni00A0million in year 5.\n\n## Acquisition of GCP 1.7\n\nOn  December/uni00A06,  2021,  Saint-Gobain  and  GCP  Applied Technologies  announced  that  they  had  entered  into  a definitive agreement pursuant to which Saint-Gobain will acquire all of the outstanding shares of GCP for USD/uni00A032.00 per share, in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately USD/uni00A02.3/uni00A0billion (approximately \u20ac2.0/uni00A0billion). This acquisition is a decisive step in establishing Saint-Gobain's leading position worldwide in construction chemicals with total  sales  of  more  than  \u20ac4/uni00A0billion  (up  from  \u20ac3/uni00A0billion previously), and furthers the Group's strategy as worldwide leader in light and sustainable construction.\n\nThe  agreed-upon  price  represents  a  multiple  (before synergies) of approximately 13.2x GCP's estimated 2022 adjusted  Ebitda  of  USD/uni00A0170/uni00A0million,  a  multiple  of  8.8x Ebitda post run-rate synergies of USD/uni00A085/uni00A0million, and a premium  of  39%  above  the  volume-weighted  average price per GCP share for the 30 unaffected trading days ended November/uni00A030, 2021.\n\nThe transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of  Directors  of  both  Saint-Gobain  and  GCP  Applied Technologies.  Saint-Gobain  has  obtained  undertakings from  Starboard  and  Standard  Investments  (formerly known  as  40North/Standard  Industries),  to  vote  their respective  stakes  of  8.9%  and  24.2%  in  favor  of  the transaction.\n\nClosing of the transaction is subject to GCP shareholders' approval,  antitrust  approvals  and  satisfaction  of  other customary closing conditions; it is expected to close by year-end 2022.\n\n## New 'Grow & Impact' 1.8 strategic plan\n\nAt its Capital Markets Day on October/uni00A06, 2021, Saint-Gobain launched 'Grow & Impact', its new strategic plan designed to accelerate the Group's profitable growth.\n\nThe Group is very well positioned on the structural growth markets of light and sustainable construction.\n\nThanks to its comprehensive range of solutions and its performance-driven  local  operating  model,  Saint-Gobain should  outperform  its  underlying  markets,  which  are accelerating.\n\nSaint-Gobain is a key player in the fight against climate change, aiming to maximize the positive impact that the Group brings to its customers while minimizing its own environmental footprint:\n\n- sustainable solutions represent 72% of Group sales; /uni25A0\n- solutions sold by the Group in one year result in the /uni25A0 avoidance of around 1,300/uni00A0million tons of CO2 over their lifespan.\n\nThe Group set new annual financial targets for 2021-2025 on  average,  including  accelerated  profit  and  cash  flow generation and attractive value creation for its shareholders:\n\n- organic revenue growth of 3%-5%; /uni25A0\n- operating margin of 9%-11%; /uni25A0\n- free cash flow conversion ratio above 50%; /uni25A0\n- ROCE of 12%-15%; /uni25A0\n- annual dividend payout ratio representing 30%-50% of /uni25A0 recurring net income;\n- \u20ac2/uni00A0billion share buyback program over the 2021-2025 /uni25A0 period.\n\n## Financing activities 1.9\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain also redeemed the following instruments at maturity:\n\n- a \u20ac750/uni00A0million private placement paying variable-rate /uni25A0 interest at 3-month Euribor +0.35% on March/uni00A022, 2021;\n- \u20ac750/uni00A0million worth of 3.625% bonds on June/uni00A015, 2021. /uni25A0\n\n8",

However, double voting rights are not forfeited when title is transferred by way of an  inheritance  or  as  a  result  of  the  liquidation  of  the marital estate or an inter vivos donation to a spouse or a relative in the direct line of succession, and the transfer is not taken into account for the purpose of calculating the two-year qualifying period.\n\nShareholders  may  vote  by  mail  in  accordance  with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Allocation and appropriation of net income (Article/uni00A020)\n\nAn appropriation of at least five per cent is deducted from net  income,  less  any  losses  carried  forward  from  the previous year, and  allocated to the reserve fund prescribed  by  law.  This  appropriation  is  no  longer mandatory once the reserve fund reaches a sum equal to one  tenth  of  the  share  capital.  It  is  reactivated  if  the reserve comes to be lower than this tenth.\n\nDistributable income corresponds to net income for the year less any losses carried forward from prior years and less any amounts to be credited to reserves in application of  the  law  or  the  Company's  bylaws,  plus  retained earnings.\n\nThe General Shareholders' Meeting may appropriate this distributable profit (loss) for the period as follows:\n\n- all or part of this amount to any contingency or special 1. reserves or to retained earnings, based on a recommendation of the Board of Directors;\n- if these appropriations do not absorb the total amount 2. of distributable income,  shareholders  are  paid  a non-cumulative first dividend equal to five per cent of the paid-up par value of shares, without being entitled to claim such payment from appropriations from the distributable income of subsequent years;\n- if any funds remain after paying these appropriations, 3. they are divided among the shareholders.\n\nThe General Meeting approving the financial statements for the fiscal year may decide to offer shareholders the option  of  receiving  all  or  part  of  the  dividend  (or  any interim dividend) in cash or in shares.\n\n9",

They  are  approved  at  that  meeting  and  the  final minutes are then sent with the agenda for the following meeting.\n\nExcept  for  meetings  held  to  approve  the  annual financial  statements  of  the  Company,  the  annual consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  annual management  report,  Directors  who  take  part  in  a Board  meeting  using  videoconferencing  or  other telecommunication  technology  enabling  them  to  be identified and to participate actively in the discussion, are  deemed  to  be  present  for  calculation  of  the quorum and voting majority.\n\n## II.

In addition, an  assessment  of  its  organization  and operation is carried out periodically at the initiative of the  Lead  independent  Director;  this  assessment  is added to the agenda of a subsequent meeting of the Board of Directors.\n\nEvery  year,  the  Board  also  reviews  each  Director's situation in relation to the independence criteria set out  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  based  on  a  report prepared by the Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee. The results of the review are reported to shareholders in the annual report.\n\nNon-Executive Directors may meet during or after a Board  meeting,  without  the  Executive  corporate officers being present, so that they can assess their performance  and  consider  the  future  line-up  of Saint-Gobain Group's General Management.",

        "page_content": "## CSR/uni00A0Information 2.\n\n## Note on methodology 2.1\n\nThe content of the CSR chapters of this document reflects broad consultation with internal and external stakeholders.\n\nInternally, countries or clusters of countries entities, BU of HPS and corporate support functions (Human Resources, Responsible Purchasing, Financial Communications, Responsible Development, EHS, etc.) have been asked to contribute, in order to enhance the report with examples.\n\nExternally, stakeholders are regularly consulted on general policy or various specific aspects of Saint-Gobain's social responsibility. These consultations assist in developing the Group's CSR reporting and communications.\n\n## Reference bases 2.1.1\n\nThe  guidelines  used  for  social  reporting,  EHS  reporting and the definition of indicators have been drawn up in accordance with the United Nations Global Compact and applicable French legislation.\n\nIn  order  to  have  a  global  reference  framework,  these standards  are  also  based  on  indicators  from  the  GRI (Global  Reporting  Initiative),  SASB  or  other  relevant standards depending on materiality issues.\n\nThe  Saint-Gobain  Group's  Social  Affairs  Department, which  is responsible for social reporting, regularly collaborates  and  exchanges  information  with  leading contributors of the Human Resources Department in order to improve the doctrine and reporting processes.\n\nFor EHS reporting, working groups suggest developments in the  new  EHS  indicators,  to  monitor  changes  in international standards, and enhance feedback from the sites. These proposals are then discussed and validated at steering committee level twice a year.\n\nThe published data on Saint-Gobain's CSR, which follows the GRI methodology, comes from three different Group reporting systems:\n\n- the Smart'R management tool for employee reporting /uni25A0 and the annual social report;\n- management and reporting system for managerial staff, /uni25A0 called Peoplegroup;\n- the EHS (Environment, Health, Safety) reporting system /uni25A0 known as Ga\u00efa.\n\n## Social reporting 2.1.2\n\n## Basis 2.1.2.1\n\n## Scope of reporting\n\nThe Group's social reporting management tool, Smart'R, counts the entities consolidated at the end of 2021. Newly integrated  companies  are  accounted  for  in  accordance with their financial integration, and companies sold during the past year are not included.\n\nThe CSR scope is based on fully consolidated entities in finance. The latest integrations of the Chryso Group and Panofrance  are  excluded,  bringing  the  CSR  scope  to  a total of 666 entities.\n\n- This tool includes the employees of fully consolidated /uni25A0 Group companies. It forms the basis for calculation of the consolidated total number of employees and the distribution of employees by gender, region, geographic  region,  socio-professional  category  and contract type.\n- Depending on the indicators, the scope of calculation of /uni25A0 social indicators will be as follows:\n- interfaced entities with Group's employees represent /uni25A0 94.5% of the CSR scope;\n- interfaced and non-interfaced entities with more than /uni25A0 500/uni00A0employees, represent 96.6% of the CSR scope ;\n- interfaced and non-interface entities with more than /uni25A0 500 employees, and non-interfaced entities with less than  500  employees,  represent  100%  of  the  CSR scope.\n- The annual social reporting provides an overview of the /uni25A0 Group's social performance. The calculation of social indicators is based on the entire scope of the annual campaign, unless stated otherwise.\n\n## Management tool 2.1.2.2\n\nSince January/uni00A02017, Smart'R has integrated payroll details on a monthly basis. Automated collection is in place for 94.5%  of  the  Group's  employees  (interfaced  entities). Manual  data  collection  is  necessary  for  entities  not integrated into shared service centers (5.5% of employees are not interfaced). Data for non-interfaced entities with more than 500 employees is collected at the entity level, no detail per employee is available. In order to simplify data collection, for non-interfaced entities with less than 500 employees, only the overall number of employees and hours worked are reported in the reporting tool\n\nInterfaces are set up as soon as it becomes relevant and technically possible to do so, however some data is still entered  manually,  particularly  for  the  newly  acquired companies.\n\nThe elements of the annual social reporting were collected and  integrated  into  Smart'R.  All  data  consolidation  is carried out at the Saint-Gobain Group level.\n\nThe data on the organization and scope of the Group is updated in Smart'R each month, based on the changes in scope such as acquisitions, divestitures or mergers, dealt with in the Group's financial consolidation report.\n\nSmart'R allows social reporting to take place. In fact, the social data required for the analysis is extracted by means of  the  MicroStrategy  reporting  system,  supported  by Smart'R.\n\nThe Human Rights questionnaire is completed each year by the Human Resources Departments of the Countries and the Activities in France in order to collect qualitative indicators, and consult internal stakeholders when drafting the report.\n\n9",

        "page_content": "CSR/uni00A0Information\n\n## Continuous improvement 2.1.2.3\n\nThe  Saint-Gobain  Group  has  taken  a  voluntary  and progressive  approach  to  enhancing  the  reliability  of  its social data, through:\n\n- continuous exchanges of information with the human /uni25A0 resources  managers  in  each  country  and  of  the activities in France  and  also  with  the  reporting contributors  to  ensure  proper  understanding  and application  of  the  rules  for  calculating  the  social indicators defined in the Group's doctrine, available in French and in English.\n- the choice of indicators, in the interests of stability to /uni25A0 ensure the reliability of comparisons over time, as far as possible;\n- the annual submission of a selection of social data for /uni25A0 external assessment;\n- strengthening  of  the  controls  implemented  at  each /uni25A0 collection and consolidation level;\n- automation  of  collection,  by  a  growing  number  of /uni25A0 interfaces between Shared Service Centers (SSC) and Smart'R, to ensure reliability and continuous improvement in data quality. Smart'R's purpose is to collect data from payment systems at the end of each month. Since the closing payment dates are different depending on the countries, some indicators are solely calculated over 12 rolling months in order to accommodate  the  potential  discrepancies  emerging from these different closing dates.\n\n## Data consolidation 2.1.2.4\n\nThe reporting process is organized into four stages:\n\n- monthly  incorporation  into  Smart'R  of  interface  files /uni25A0 originating from Shared Service Centers and questionnaire for non-interfaced entities;\n- collection of the annual social data in questionnaires, /uni25A0 performed  by  contributors  at  company  level.  This represents additional data not present in Smart'R, such as indicators regarding social relations ( e.g. number of agreements signed);\n- verification and consolidation within the Group's Social /uni25A0 Affairs Department;\n- the reporting allows spreadsheets to be generated as /uni25A0 management tools for the Group's Human Resources Department and at all levels of the structure, both at company and regional levels.\n\n## Absenteeism and temporary indicators 2.1.2.5\n\nAbsence or temporary employment data of certain entities are sometimes difficult to collect in view of local contexts. Absenteeism  rate  is  therefore  calculated  over  a  more limited  scope  than  that  of  the  annual  social  reporting campaign.\n\nAbsenteeism  rate  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  and corresponds to the total number of hours of absence over the total number of theoretical hours worked. The reasons for  absence  taken  into  account  in  this  indicator  are absences  for  illness,  absences  relating  to  occupational accidents (or travel), absences  due  to  strike  and unjustified absences. Authorized or anticipated absences ( e.g. leave, family events) are not included in this indicator.\n\nIn some countries, entities have been excluded from the indicator's calculation  because  of  the  lack  of  data explained  by  a  variety  of  reasons  (no  interfaces,  local regulation, etc.). The following countries are concerned by this  exclusion:  United  States,  Canada,  Colombia,  Ireland and Switzerland, as well as non-interfaced entities with less than 500/uni00A0employees.\n\nThe  temporary  employment  rate  is  expressed  as  a percentage and corresponds to the total number of hours worked by temporary employees out of the total number of hours worked for the Group. Temporary employment does not include subcontractors and service providers.\n\nIn  several  countries,  entities  were  excluded  from  the calculation of the indicator due to lack of data for various reasons  (local  regulations,  accounting  difficulties,  etc.). This year, one entity in Norway, one in France and one in the  Netherlands  were  excluded  from  the  temporay employment rate.\n\n## Training indicators 2.1.2.6\n\nThe scope is that of the Smart'R entities interfaced with payroll, i.e . 94.6% of the total workforce.\n\n## Difficulties and restrictions 2.1.2.7\n\nThe main difficulty lies in the variety of countries in which the Group is active. The guidelines for the calculation of social  reporting  indicators  are  distributed  each  year  to contributors, but the indicators are sometimes interpreted according to local contexts (national laws or practices).\n\n## EHS reporting 2.1.3\n\n## Basis 2.1.3.1\n\n## Scope of reporting\n\nThe EHS reporting covers 1,369 entities corresponding to all the Group's facilities. All entities belonging  to consolidated  companies  in  which  Saint-Gobain  held  a stake of 50% or more at balance sheet date are monitored. This includes, where possible, facilities that came on-stream  or  were  acquired  during  the  year,  excluding facilities that were closed or sold.\n\nThe  entities  are  defined  by  the  type  of  establishment according  to  the  following  categories:  factory,  sales branch  or  group  of  stores,  office,  warehouse,  Research and Development Center, mines and quarries, building site.",

Depending on the questionnaire, they also cover temporary employees and subcontractors (Safety and Safety-On-Line questionnaires).\n\nSafety data are reported on a monthly basis and comprise all accidents occurring during the month and their severity level. The system covers approximately 97% of the Group's employees. Full coverage is not achieved because of the maximum of two years' grace for newly acquired establishments to be included in Ga\u00efa.\n\nFurthermore, the Safety reporting does not only include the Group's employees, but also temporary staff and permanent subcontractors over the entire perimeter, except some subcontractors from the distribution depending on the countries.\n\nOne-time reporting also allows entities, through the Safety-On-Line system, to systematically report any occupational accident, with or without lost time, including fatal events, and to explain the circumstances.\n\nThe industrial hygiene and health questionnaire and the General questionnaire are completed annually.\n\nThe Environment questionnaire is also completed annually, by 826 entities. The consolidated data from these entities corresponds to the 'Group scope'. An 'environmental concerned perimeter' has been established. The sites of this perimeter have been selected to focus efforts on establishments having the greatest impact, and to improve data legibility and progress toward goals. The activities have therefore validated certain criteria (energy and water consumption, quantity of non-recovered waste, etc.) enabling clear identification and monitoring.\n\nThis scope includes 450 entities.\n\nThe EvE standard for environmental events management identifies and manages events that could potentially occur at the sites.\n\nEHS financial data (expenses and capital expenditure) are tracked in the SIF, the Group's financial reporting tool since 2013.\n\n## 2010-2025 and 2017-2030 objectives 2.1.3.2\n\nThe Group has set medium-term objectives, up to 2025, based on the 2010 results. They are established using comparable production for three-year periods. This means, for example, that 2020-2022 emissions and consumption are recalculated based on 2019 production.\n\nBased on the results from the baseline year for the three-year period, the Group updates every three years the scope of 'concerned sites' for which environmental results are tracked for the next three years (2011-2013/2014-2016/2017-2019/2020-2022/ 2023-2025).\n\nThe published results for this scope therefore have a comparable scope for the three years within the period : sites closed or sold are removed from current year and baseline year, but no acquisitions are taken into account. They are included in the subsequent period.\n\nProgress achieved over these five three-year periods (between 2010 and 2025) will be cumulated to assess whether the 2025 objectives have been achieved based on the 2010 results.\n\nThe Group has also set objectives for 2030 based on the results of 2017 including Continental (for targets related to CO2 emissions, water withdrawals, virgin raw materials avoided and non-recovered waste). They are defined in absolute value, for the entire Group.\n\n## Data consolidation 2.1.3.3\n\nThe EHS reporting protocol is available in French and English. The reporting process (both monthly and annual) involves three stages:\n\n- data input, performed by the EHS correspondent(s) at /uni25A0 the reporting unit concerned;\n- data verification, carried out by each country, cluster or /uni25A0 BU, through its EHS Directors;\n- data consolidation by the Group's EHS Department /uni25A0 management.\n\n## Difficulties and restrictions 2.1.3.4\n\nSince the launch of the Group's reporting tools, the quality of reporting has continuously improved thanks to feedback and better use of the systems by all teams, thanks to training and verification tools. These factors allow the Group to prevent potential errors such as differences in units of measurement between businesses and countries, and difficulties in interpreting technical terms.\n\n9",

The indicators regarding trade purchases are calculated based on  trade  purchases  realized  in  2019  and  adjusted according to entities sold during the year.\n\n## Trade reporting perimeter 2.1.4.1\n\nThe indicators described in section/uni00A01.4 from chapter 3 and published  in  section/uni00A02.2  from  chapter/uni00A04,  are  calculated based on the following perimeters:\n\n- European  partner  suppliers  are  strategic  suppliers /uni25A0 benefitting from a European master agreement. These suppliers  represent  51%  of  total  purchases.  These suppliers  sign  a  master  agreement  including  the Suppliers Charter;\n- the  main  suppliers  are  those  with  which  more  than /uni25A0 3/uni00A0million euros of annual purchases are done, among them  are  European  partners  and  local  brands'  main national suppliers (France, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and United Kingdom). These identified suppliers cover over 79% of total trade purchases. These suppliers are included  in  the  CSR  risk  management  (risk  analysis, practices  assessment,  mitigation  actions)  and  are considered  in  suppliers'  distribution  by  level  of  CSR performance;\n\n- private labels' suppliers are those with whom /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain  Sourcing  (in  India  and  China)  develops products commercialized with a brand of the Group. They  represent  a  limited  proportion  of  total  trade purchases. They are considered in the results of audits on site.\n\n## Eligible perimeter non-trade purchases 2.1.4.2\n\nSuppliers of non-trade purchases perimeter considered in the indicators are the suppliers of over 100/uni00A0thousand euros in  annual  purchases  who  have  not  been  subject  to  a waiver (supplier owned by a state government or in a position  of  sole  sourcing)  and  that  do  not  concern spending linked to industries that are not managed by the Purchasing Department (banks, insurance, Legal Departments).\n\nThis perimeter represents 77% of the Group's non-trade perimeter total spending.\n\nCSR  performance  levels  of  documentary  reviews  were reviewed  in  2020  by  taking  into  account  new  trends (emergence of new regulations, increase of stakeholders' expectations, greater customer requirements) in order to review  the  minimum  expected  requirements  regarding CSR from suppliers identified as potentially risky following the risk analysis.",

It is the product of a consultation with the Group's  internal  stakeholders  and  takes  into  account Saint-Gobain's new organization, effective as of January/uni00A01, 2019. It presents the Group's sustainable growth generation process through its key resources and its main pillars of value creation.\n\n## CSR risk and opportunity analysis\n\nSaint-Gobain  has  conducted  its  study  of  the  risks  and opportunities  related  to  Corporate  Social  Responsibility (CSR)  within  the  framework  of  the  priority  challenges presented  in  the  materiality  analysis  (see  chapter/uni00A02, section/uni00A01.3.2).\n\nThus, a universe of the 15 most important CSR risks and opportunities for Saint-Gobain was built by factoring in the Group's strategy, objectives and operations as well as its main environmental, social and societal challenges. In an effort to harmonize the vocabulary and vision on these challenges,  a  table  presenting  a  risk  or  opportunity's definition, potential impacts for stakeholders on the one\n\nhand  and  for  Saint-Gobain  on  the  other  hand,  was provided.\n\nThese risks and opportunities were then rated according to stakeholders' expectations in order to combine internal and external visions of the organization, according to the methodology shared with internal audit and control. While the  risk  assessment  methodology  follows  the  process developed by the internal control, the value scales were adapted to non-financial impacts and a long-term time scale.  The  interviews  were  conducted  from  May  to September/uni00A02018 with two criteria to assess: impact and criticality. Members of the Executive Committee participated in these evaluations.\n\nNine CSR risks and opportunities were identified as the most important:\n\n- diversity within the organization and inclusion; /uni25A0\n- energy efficiency and carbon intensity of operations; /uni25A0\n- business ethics; /uni25A0\n- management of skills and talents; /uni25A0\n- responsible supply chain management; /uni25A0\n- integration of recycled materials; /uni25A0\n- energy  and  carbon  performance  of  products  and /uni25A0 services;\n- health and safety at work; /uni25A0\n- product safety. /uni25A0\n\nThe  identification  of  these  risks  is  a  key  step  in  the construction of the Group's CSR roadmap (see chapter/uni00A02, section/uni00A03.4.3).",

Manufacture of energy-efficient equipment for the buildings .  Activity 3.5 directly covers several Saint-Gobain \u25a0 product categories, including insulation, glazing for external fa\u00e7ades (windows), plasterboard and mortars that are part of an insulation system;\n- 3.6.  Manufacture  of  other  low  carbon  technologies. Activity  3.6  concerns  Saint-Gobain  products  and  solutions \u25a0 contributing to substantial reduction (compared to the most efficient alternative on the market) of GHG emissions generated by the product or by the manufacturing process to which they contribute.\n\nThe reporting scope concerns all Saint-Gobain consolidated entities at the end of 2021.\n\nThe proportion of Saint-Gobain's turnover linked to sustainable solutions (see chapter 3, section 3.4.4)  includes activities that have not been assessed in the context of compliance with the European \"2020/852 Taxonomy Regulation\", such as distribution activities, and impacts and benefits that have not yet been included in the regulation, such as resources and circular economy, as well as benefits related to health, safety and comfort, which will potentially be eligible for the social taxonomy.\n\n## 3.5.2 KPI calculation\n\n## Turnover\n\nThe relevant turnover is the Group consolidated turnover.\n\n| Saint-Gobain economic activities   | Turnover in 2021 (k\u20ac)   | Proportion of turnover in 2021 (%)   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Taxonomy-eligible activities       | 7,140,204               | 16.2%                                |\n| Taxonomy non-eligible activities   | 37,019,570              | 83.8%                                |\n| Saint-Gobain turnover              | 44,159,774              | 100%                                 |\n\n## CAPEX\n\nData  included  in  the  CapEx  calculation  are  related  to  investments  declared  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.
