We select the report's topics based on the following principles: materiality, sustainability context, completeness, balance and stakeholder inclusion. In addition to this report, we publish further information online. The relevant links can be found at the end of each chapter.\n\nOur sustainability reporting has been based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and standards since 2003. We have applied the 'Comprehensive' option since 2017.\n\nWe have been active in the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) since 2014 and have supported the work of the Value Reporting Foundation, formed by the merger of the IIRC and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), since 2021. This involvement  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  discuss  our  experiences  of integrated reporting with stakeholders and at the same time, receive inspiration for enhancing our reporting. BASF's report addresses elements of the IIRC framework by illustrating how we create value, for example. The information contained in this report also serves as a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprogress report on BASF's implementation of the 10 principles of the U.N. Global Compact.\n\nThe GRI and Global Compact Index can be found in the online report. It provides an overview of all relevant information to fulfill the GRI indicators and shows how we contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the principles of the U.N. Global Compact. The results of the limited assurance of this information conducted by KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs gesellschaft can also be found there. We also publish online additional information on sustainability in accordance with the industry- specific requirements of the SASB.\n\nThe information on the financial position and performance of the BASF Group comply with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and, where applicable, the German Commercial Code (HGB), German Accounting Standards (GAS) and the guidelines on alternative performance measures from the European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority  (ESMA).  Internal  control mechanisms ensure the reliability of the information presented in this report. BASF's Board of Executive Directors confirmed the effectiveness of the internal control measures and compliance with the regulations for financial reporting.\n\nMaterial topics along the value chain form the focal points of reporting and define the limits of this report. We take three dimensions into account in identifying and evaluating material topics: the impact on BASF, the impact of BASF and relevance for our stakeholders.\n\n- For more information on our sustainability reporting, see from page 45 and 96 onward Our value creation based on the IIRC framework can be found on page 24 and in the online report For more information on our control and risk management system, see page 151 onward\n- The 2021 BASF Online Report can be found at basf.com/report The GRI and Global Compact Index can be found at basf.com/en/gri-gc The SASB index can be found at basf.com/sasb",

The data and information for the reporting period were sourced from the expert units responsible using representative methods. Due to rounding, individual figures may not add up  exactly to the totals shown and percentages may not correspond exactly to the figures shown.\n\nThe reporting period is the 2021 business year. Relevant information is included up to the editorial deadline of February/uni00A021, 2022.\n\nBASF/uni00A0Group's scope of consolidation for its financial reporting comprises BASF/uni00A0SE, with its headquarters in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and all of its fully consolidated subsidiaries and proportionally consolidated joint operations. Shares in joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for, if material, using the equity method in the BASF/uni00A0 Group Consolidated Financial Statements and are thus not included in the scope of consolidation.\n\nThe section 'Employees' refers to employees active in a company within the BASF/uni00A0Group scope of consolidation as of December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nOur data collection methods for environmental protection and safety are based on the recommendations of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) and the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC). In the section 'We Produce Safely and Efficiently,' we report all data of the worldwide production sites of BASF/uni00A0SE, its fully consolidated subsidiaries, and proportionally consolidated joint operations. BASF/uni00A0SE subsidiaries that are fully consolidated in the Group financial statements in which BASF holds an interest of less than 100% are included in full in environmental reporting. The emissions of proportionally consolidated joint operations are disclosed pro rata according to our interest. Work-related accidents at all sites of BASF/uni00A0SE and its subsidiaries as well as joint operations and joint ventures in which we have sufficient authority in terms of safety management are compiled worldwide regardless of our interest and\n\nreported in full. Unless otherwise indicated, data on social responsibility and transportation safety refers to BASF/uni00A0SE and its  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe divested pigments business is included in the disclosures and indicators on employees, the environment, and health and safety on a pro rata basis until June/uni00A030, 2021. Sales from the divested pigments business are no longer integrated in the portfolio to be evaluated under the Sustainable Solution Steering method for 2021. BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., which was formed on August/uni00A0 31, 2021, is included in the sustainability disclosures and indicators on a pro rata basis. The company's sales to third parties are already included in the sum of relevant sales according to the Sustainable Solution Steering method. They are listed as 'not assessed.' We will start classification in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on companies accounted for in the Consolidated Financial Statements, see the Notes from page 205 onward\n- The list of shares held can be found at basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## External audit\n\nOur reporting is audited by a third party. KPMG/uni00A0 AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft has audited the BASF/uni00A0 Group Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  the  Management's  Report  and  has approved themn free of qualification.\n\nThe limited assurance of the sustainability information contained in the  Management's  Report  was  conducted  in  accordance  with ISAE/uni00A03000 (Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of  Historical  Financial  Information)  and  ISAE/uni00A0 3410  (Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements), the relevant international assurance standards for sustainability reporting. KPMG conducted a reasonable assurance of all disclosures on the most important  nonfinancial  key  performance  indicators,  accelerator sales and CO2 emissions. The forecast for the key performance indicator  CO2 emissions is also part of the Management's Report and is covered by the annual audit. No forecast has been made for the previous Accelerator target as we plan to update our portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsteering target in 2022.

Despite  the  ongoing coronavirus pandemic, widespread supply bottlenecks, and increasingly higher energy and raw materials prices, we achieved record levels of sales and earnings. We achieved an EBIT before special items of \u20ac7.8 billion. Our sales volumes were five percentage points above the 6% growth in the global chemical industry and we raised prices by 25%. This enabled us to once again earn a premium on our cost of capital in 2021. Our economic development confirms that we are on the right path with our strategic direction, our adapted organizational structure and our ongoing cost discipline.\n\nAt BASF, we have an ambitious dividend policy. Our free cash flow of \u20ac3.7 billion reflects our financial strength. Therefore, we will propose to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting a dividend of \u20ac3.40 per share, representing an increase of 10/uni00A0 euro cents compared with the previous year. We want to be an attractive investment and reliably create value for you, our shareholders.\n\nThe development of our share price in 2021 remained well below our expectations, despite our very good operating performance and targeted strategic develop ment. Given that we believe that BASF is significantly under valued on the capital market, we decided on January 4, 2022, to buy back own shares in the amount of up to \u20ac3 billion.\n\n\u00bb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt BASF, we have an ambitious dividend policy.\n\nWhat makes us so confident about the value of BASF? What are our priorities for the transformation to climate neutrality and the further development of our company?\n\nAs the largest chemical company in the world, we are leaders in our industry. We are ambitious. This applies especially to the transformation to climate neutrality. We want to show that this transformation and competitiveness are not mutually exclusive. Our global responsibility for sustainable development is anchored in our corporate purpose: We create chemistry for a sustainable future.\n\nEffective climate protection and scarce resources are the central   challenges of our time. We want to reduce our CO2 emissions worldwide by 25% by 2030 compared with 2018. Our 2050 target is net zero emissions. These are very ambitious goals. It is the biggest transformation in the history of the chemical industry and for BASF, considering that our production is energy intensive and that we want to continue to grow at the same time. The energy transformation will make great demands on us. But we are confident that we will succeed!\n\nWe can only reach climate neutrality if we completely transform our production by replacing energy sources based on fossil fuels with electricity from renewable resources. That will require entirely new processes and technologies and the\n\n<!-- image -->",

It will involve converting the big steam crackers from heating based on fossil fuels to electrical heating. In these plants, at the beginning of the value chains, steam is used to split naphtha into basic\n\nchemicals  at  about  850/uni00A0 degrees  Celsius.  Other examples include the CO2-free production of hydrogen by water electrolysis and methane pyrolysis, and using waste heat recovered with heat pumps instead of con ven tional steam generation in gas-fired power plants. We will invest  roughly \u20ac4 billion to reach our 2030 emission reduction  targets.\n\nWe are also redefining raw material cycles through recycling. Good examples of this are the chemical recycling  process  in  which  a  new  raw  material,\n\npyrolysis oil, is obtained from plastic waste; the recycling of mattresses, which are broken down into polyurethane precursors; and the use of bio-based raw materials. There is a great feeling of excitement in the BASF team! With our innovation power, creativity and entre preneurial courage, we look to the future with optimism.\n\nElectricity from renewable sources in great quantities and at favorable prices would enable us to achieve a climate-neutral future. This is made possible by the electrification of entire value chains. To achieve this, we need to massively expand renewable energies worldwide. Currently, this is not happening fast enough. That is why we are leading the way and securing access to green power. We already announced  several  projects  in  2021  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  our Make/uni00A0 &/uni00A0 Buy strategy: We have secured a half share in a 1.5 gigawatt offshore wind park from Vattenfall in the North Sea off the coast of the Netherlands. It should be connected to the grid in 2023. It will be the world's biggest offshore wind farm - and all this without any public subsidies. We are taking a different approach with \u00d8rsted and Engie: We have concluded attractive electricity supply contracts with both energy companies for a term of 25 years. In other regions as well, for example, in the United States and China, we are securing access to green power. In this way, we are planning proactively and laying the foundation to ensure a long-term supply of electricity from renewable resources.\n\n\u00bb\n\nCO2-free chemical production is the future. And BASF wants to be among the first there. It all starts with transparency, which is why we provide our cus tom ers with Product Carbon Footprints (PCF) - the carbon footprint associated with production per kilogram of sales product - for each of our 45,000 sales products. Furthermore, we help our customers develop strategies to reduce their carbon footprint, to use resources more efficiently, and to manufacture products in a more environmentally friendly way. We expect that demand for such emission-free or emission-reduced products will exceed supply in the medium term, and that their market value will more than compensate for the higher production costs. It therefore also makes good economic sense to take a leading role here. That is why we want to be among the first to provide as many products as possible from our portfolio with a reduced carbon footprint in large volumes by the end of the decade. This differentiates us, increases our competitiveness and enables growth above market.\n\nProfitable growth lays the foundation for a successful transformation. This is why we continue to focus our  portfolio  and  business  activities  on  organic growth. And the reverse is also true: The trans formation is the foundation for a wide range of growth opportunities!  Neither  future  prosperity  nor  climate neutrality is  possible without a competitive chemical industry and innovative chemical products. Extensive regulations driven by policymakers and  society do present a  tremendous challenge to industry in general\n\n\u00bb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCO2\u00adfree chemical production is the future. And BASF wants to be among the first there .\n\nand  particularly to the chemical industry. At the same time,  however, they lead to new business opportunities. The dynamic development from the combustion engine to electromobility is a good example of this. As a leading chemical  supplier to the automotive industry and producer of innovative cathode active materials for electric vehicle batteries, we are able to profit from this  development. Growth and climate protection go hand in hand: Our materials not only support the dynamic growth of this market, but their low carbon footprint also paves the way for climate-neutral mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustainable solutions and innovative products across our entire  portfolio enable us to remain on our  growth  path  and  systematically  drive  the transformation to greater sustainability.\n\nWe act swiftly and systematically in the implementation of our long-term strategy for profitable\n\ngrowth. I am convinced that climate neutrality and sustainable resource use are not possible without a competitive chemical industry. Our company is very well positioned. We make our contribution to society and at the same time, secure our long-term competitiveness. I am pleased that you support us on our path to a sustainable future. Many thanks for your trust.\n\nYours,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMartin Bruderm\u00fcller\n\n\u00bb\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was due in particular to the approval and increasing availability of effective coronavirus vaccines. BASF stands by its ambitious dividend policy and will propose a dividend of \u20ac3.40 per share to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting - an increase of 10 euro cents compared with the previous year. Based on the year-end share price for 2021, BASF/uni00A0shares offer a high dividend yield of around 5.5%.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA BASF share price declines 4.5% in 2021\n- /uni25AA Assuming that dividends were reinvested, BASF's share performance rose by 0.2%\n\n## BASF share performance\n\nThe BASF/uni00A0 share closed the 2021 stock market year at \u20ac61.78, a decrease of 4.5% compared with the previous year's closing price (\u20ac64.72).\n\nBASF's/uni00A0 share price reached an annual high of \u20ac72.61 in March 2021 before declining over the course of the year despite continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npositive business performance. This was due to factors such as the composition of the segments' earnings contributions. Share price development was also negatively impacted by market expectations regarding the future development of margins in the basic chemicals business.\n\nAssuming that dividends were reinvested, BASF's share performance rose by 0.2% in 2021.

The  global  industry  index  MSCI  World  Chemicals gained 21.7%.\n\nThe assets of an investor who invested \u20ac1,000 in BASF/uni00A0 shares at  the  end  of  2011  and  reinvested  the  dividends  in  additional BASF/uni00A0shares would have increased to \u20ac1,733 by the end of 2021. This represents an average annual yield of 5.7%.\n\n## Proposed dividend of \u20ac3.40 per share\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend payment of \u20ac3.40 per share to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. BASF stands by its ambitious dividend policy of increasing the per-share dividend each year and plans to pay out \u20ac3.1/uni00A0billion 1 to the shareholders of BASF/uni00A0SE.\n\nBased on the year-end share price for 2021, BASF/uni00A0shares offer a high dividend yield of around 5.5%. BASF is part of the DivDAX share index, which contains the 15 companies with the highest dividend yield in the DAX/uni00A040.\n\n## Share buyback program of up to \u20ac3/uni00A0billion\n\nIn light of the positive business development and the gains on divestitures in the course of 2021, the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE resolved on a share buyback program on January/uni00A04, 2022. The program amounts to up to \u20ac3 billion, started on January/uni00A011, 2022, and shall be concluded by December/uni00A031, 2023, at the latest, subject to a renewed authorization to repurchase own shares by the Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  BASF/uni00A0 SE  on  April/uni00A0 29,  2022. BASF/uni00A0 SE will cancel all repurchased shares and reduce the share capital accordingly.\n\nThe  share  buyback  program  is  based  on  the  authorization  by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of BASF/uni00A0 SE on May/uni00A0 12, 2017 authorizing the Board of Executive Directors to purchase up to 10% of the issued shares at the time of the resolution until May/uni00A011, 2022. BASF plans to propose to the 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting a renewed authorization to buy back own shares.\n\nIn addition to its progressive dividend policy, share buybacks are another tool that BASF uses to create value for its shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Broad base of international shareholders\n\nWith over 800,000 shareholders, BASF is one of the largest publicly owned companies with a high free float. An analysis of the shareholder structure carried out at the end of 2021 showed that, at around 19% of share capital, the United States and Canada made up the largest regional group of institutional investors. Institutional investors from Germany accounted for around 9%. Institutional investors from the United Kingdom and Ireland hold 6% of BASF shares, while investors from the rest of Europe hold a further 13% of capital. Approximately 39% of the company's share capital is held by private investors, nearly all of whom reside in Germany. BASF is therefore one of the DAX companies with the largest percentage of private shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees becoming shareholders\n\nIn many countries, we offer share purchase programs that turn our employees into BASF shareholders. In 2021, for example, around 23,600/uni00A0employees (2020: around 27,600) purchased BASF shares worth \u20ac38.2/uni00A0million (2020: \u20ac61.1/uni00A0million).\n\n- For more information on employee share purchase programs, see page 97",

As a participant in various value chains, BASF is committed to ending deforestation in these supply chains. Consequently, BASF is one of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe companies with Leadership status, as for climate protection and water management.\n\nBASF maintained its Prime status in the ISS ESG rating developed by Institutional Shareholder Services and is among the top 7% of the companies assessed.

KPMG also conducted a limited assurance of the NFS. An assurance statement of the limited assurance can be found online at basf.com/nfs-audit-2021. The assurance was conducted in accordance with ISAE/uni00A0 3000 (Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information) and ISAE/uni00A03410 (Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements), the relevant international assurance standards for sustainability reporting.\n\n## Disclosures required by takeover law in accordance with section/uni00A0315a HGB\n\nThe disclosures required by takeover law in accordance with section/uni00A0315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) can be found in the Corporate Governance chapter starting on page 161.

We combine economic success with environmental protection and social  responsibility. Around 111,000 employees contribute to the success of our customers in nearly all sectors and almost every country in the world. Our portfolio is divided into the Chemicals, Materials, Industrial Solutions, Surface Technologies, Nutrition/uni00A0& Care and Agricultural Solutions segments.\n\n## Sites and Verbund\n\nBASF has companies in 90/uni00A0 countries. We operate six  Verbund sites and 232/uni00A0 additional production sites worldwide. Our Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, is the world's largest integrated chemical complex owned by a single company.   The Verbund concept was developed and optimized here and later applied to other sites around the world. Construction of the first plants  continued  at  our  planned  new  smart  Verbund  site  in Zhanjiang, China.\n\nThe Verbund system is one of BASF's great strengths. We add value by using our resources efficiently. The Production/uni00A0 Verbund intelligently links production units and their energy supply so that, for example, the waste heat of one plant provides energy to others. Furthermore, one facility's by-products can serve as feedstocks elsewhere. This not only saves us raw materials and energy - it also avoids emissions, lowers logistics costs and leverages synergies.\n\nWe also make use of the Verbund principle for more than production, applying it for technologies, the market and digitalization as well. Expert knowledge is pooled in our global research.\n\nFor more information on the Verbund concept, see basf.com/en/verbund\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\n## The BASF Group's segments in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chemicals\n\nThe Chemicals segment consists of the Petrochemicals and Intermediates divisions.

We provide a high level of transparency around the results of our segments and show the importance of the Verbund and value chains to our business success. BASF aims to differentiate its businesses from their competitors and establish a highperformance organization to enable BASF to be successful in an increasingly competitive market environment.\n\nThe operating divisions, the service units, the regions and the corporate center form the cornerstones of the BASF organization, in line with the corporate strategy. As part of the implementation of our strategy, we streamlined our administration, sharpened the roles of services and regions, and simplified procedures and processes. The organizational realignment created the conditions for greater customer  proximity,  increased  competitiveness  and  profitable growth.\n\nThe divisions bear strategic and operational responsibility here and are organized according to sectors or products. They manage the 50 global and regional business units and develop strategies for 75/uni00A0strategic business units.\n\nThe regional and country units represent BASF locally and support the growth of business units with local proximity to customers. For financial reporting purposes, we organize the regional divisions into four regions: Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, and South/uni00A0 America, Africa and Middle East.\n\nOur research is currently divided into three global divisions: Process Research/uni00A0& Chemical Engineering, Advanced Materials/uni00A0& Systems Research and Bioscience Research. To strengthen our innovation capabilities, we will reorganize our global research activities in 2022 and align them even more closely with the needs of our customers. To this end, we will integrate downstream research into the divisions and bundle activities with broad relevance in a research unit. This\n\nunit will continue to be globally positioned with research centers in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific.\n\nFive service units provide competitive services for the operating divisions and sites: Global Engineering Services, Global Digital Services, Global Procurement, European Site/uni00A0& Verbund Management,  Global Business Services (finance, human resources, environmental protection, health and safety, intellectual property, communications, procurement, supply chain and inhouse consulting services).\n\nFollowing the bundling of services and resources and the implementation of a wide-ranging digitalization strategy, the number of employees in the Global Business Services unit worldwide will decline by up to 2,000 by the end of 2022 compared with baseline/uni00A0 2019. From 2023 onward, the division expects to achieve annual cost savings of over \u20ac200/uni00A0million.\n\nThe Corporate Center supports the Board of Executive Directors in steering the company as a whole. These include central tasks from the following areas: strategy, finance and controlling, compliance and law, tax, environmental protection, health and safety, human resources, communications, investor relations and internal audit.\n\nOur Excellence Program aimed to contribute \u20ac2/uni00A0billion to EBITDA annually until the end of 2021 onward compared with baseline/uni00A02018. We met this target in 2021. As planned, this was partly due to the reduction of more than 6,000/uni00A0positions worldwide until the end of 2021. This decrease resulted from the organizational simplification and from efficiency gains in administration, the service units and the operating divisions.\n\n- For more information on the products and services offered by the segments, see pages 72, 76, 79, 82, 85 and 88 onward\n\nFor more information on the segment structure, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial  Statements from page 213 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

As an industry leader, we want to be the most attractive partner for challenges that can be solved with chemistry. That is why our customers are at the center of everything we do. We want to grow profitably and at the same time, create value for society and the environment. We help to change the world for the better with our expertise, our innovative and  entrepreneurial spirit, and the power of our Verbund integration. This is our goal, embedded in our corporate purpose: We create chemistry for a sustainable future.\n\nThe world is changing at a rapid pace - more and more urgently than  ever,  solutions  are  needed  for  a  more  sustainable  future. Chemistry plays a key role here. In almost all areas of life, it can help overcome pressing global challenges with innovative products and technologies - from climate change and using resources more sparingly to feeding the world's population. This belief is expressed in our corporate purpose and is what motivates us day in and day out: We create chemistry for a sustainable future.\n\n## Our corporate purpose\n\nWe create chemistry for a sustainable future\n\nOur mission and motivation is to grow profitably and make a positive contribution to society and the environment. For example, BASF's solutions contribute to climate protection and help to prevent or recycle waste, produce healthy and affordable food, and enable climate-smart  mobility.\n\nAt the same time, as an energy and resource-intensive company, we are facing what is probably the biggest transformation in our over 150-year history: The shift toward a carbon-neutral and circular economy  and  the  associated  landmarks  such  as  the  European Green Deal demand from us new concepts and approaches - for the way we produce, for our raw material base and for our energy  supply.\n\nWe also see these disruptive changes as an opportunity. As the world's largest chemical company, we want to lead the way and actively and responsibly shape the change . That is why we are gradually switching our energy and raw material supplies to renewable sources. We are strengthening our Verbund structure as the basis for resource-efficient, safe and reliable production. We are developing pioneering low-carbon production processes for our products. We are accelerating our innovation processes and deepening  cooperation  with  partners  to  develop  high-performance products that also require fewer resources and have a lower carbon footprint. We are harnessing the many opportunities of digitalization. We are systematically aligning our portfolio with growth areas and future technologies, and are integrating sustainability into our value chains even more strongly. We create a working environment in which our employees can thrive and contribute to BASF's long-term success. This is how we live our corporate purpose.\n\nFor more information on our strategic action areas, see page 28 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In this section:\n\nStrategic Action Areas Values and Global Standards Business Models of the Segments Targets and Target Achievement 2021 Investments and Portfolio Measures Steering Concept Sustainability Concept Innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net Zero Accelerator\n\nThe new Net Zero Accelerator unit started work on January/uni00A01, 2022. It bundles the extensive cross-company activities with which we want to achieve our ambitious climate protection targets. The unit will initially have around 80 employees and report directly to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors.  It  will  focus  on  accelerating  and  implementing projects relating to low-CO2 production technologies, circular economy and renewable energies - driving forward BASF's transformation to a climate-neutral company. In parallel, our operating divisions will continue to work on divisional-specific carbon reduction projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on climate neutrality, see pages 27 and 126 to 132",

To enable us to meet our growing demand in the future, we are gradually switching our supply agreements to green power and investing in our own plants. Find out more about how we are driving forward the transformation of our energy supply in the online  report at report.basf.com.\n\n## In focus:\n\n## Our Journey to Climate Neutrality\n\nClimate change is the greatest challenge of the 21st/uni00A0century. Swift and resolute action is needed to ensure that the targets agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement can be achieved. We stand by this responsibility. In many areas, products and innovations based on chemistry are the key to a climateneutral future. At the same time, we are working intensively to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of our production and thus of our products.\n\nOur target: net zero emissions by 2050. We have set ourselves an ambitious milestone on this path. By 2030, we want to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from our production sites and our energy purchases by 25% compared with 2018 - while growing production volumes. This corresponds to a decrease of around 60% compared with 1990. We are intensely pursuing our climate protection targets with investments of up to \u20ac4/uni00A0billion by 2030. Our focus here is on five strategic levers : We are increasingly meeting our energy needs  from  renewable  sources  (gray-to-green  lever).  We  are increasingly relying on energy recovery to produce steam (powerto-steam lever). We are working to further improve the energy and process efficiency of our plants (continuous opex lever). We are increasingly replacing fossil resources with bio-based raw materials (bio-based feedstocks lever). And together with partners, we are pioneering nearly carbon-free production processes, especially for emission- intensive basic chemicals (new technologies lever).\n\nWe want to play an active and responsible role in shaping the transition toward a climate-neutral society. This calls for new ways of thinking and working together. And it needs a political and regulatory environment that promotes innovation in climate protection, makes it possible to develop new, climate-smart processes that are competitive internationally and, above all, resolutely drives forward the expansion of renewable energies - including through the appropriate land use designations, rapid planning and approval procedures and the swift expansion of grid infrastructure.\n\nOne thing is clear: The transformation will require significantly more energy from renewable sources. Initial estimates suggest that at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany alone, we would need to roughly triple or quadruple our current electricity use (2021: 6.0 TWh) to fully implement new, low-carbon electricity-based production processes. To meet this demand, we are investing in our own power assets, especially for wind power, and are increasingly buying green electricity on the market (make & buy approach).\n\nAlso critical to success are prices for renewable energy . Substituting fossil fuels is only economically feasible at production costs of 4 to 5/uni00A0cents/kWh. Consequently, there is an urgent need to expand supply and reduce the levies and fees on electricity prices. In addition, globally comparable carbon pricing - or at least at G20 level - is needed to ensure that climate-friendly processes are competitive internationally.\n\n- For more information on energy and climate protection, see page 126 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on raw materials, see page 112 onward\n\nOur global climate protection targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## -25%\n\nReduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 2018 (Scope/uni00A01 and 2)\n\n## Net zero\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (Scope/uni00A01 and 2)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our Strategic Action Areas\n\nOur customers are our number one priority and are at the heart of our strategy. We want to be their most attractive partner for challenges that can be solved with chemistry. BASF supplies products and services to around 90,000/uni00A0customers 1 from almost all sectors and countries around the world. Our customer portfolio ranges from major global customers and small and medium-sized enterprises to end consumers. Our comprehensive product portfolio means that we are active in many value chains and value creation networks. We use various business strategies, which we adapt to the needs of individual industries and markets. These range from cost leadership in basic chemicals to tailored system solutions for specific customer applications.\n\n## Selected awards\n\n- /uni25AA Ford: World Excellence Award\n- /uni25AA Dulux: Supplier of the Year Award\n- /uni25AA 3M: Supplier of the Year Award\n\nWe continue to drive forward our customer focus. We have refined our organizational structure to enable our operating divisions to flexibly address specific market requirements and differentiate themselves from the competition.\n\nWe are also improving our customer relationships with a range of measures. For example, since 2019 we have been using the Net Promoter System \u00ae worldwide to systematically record and optimize our problem-solving skills, product quality and delivery reliability based on direct customer feedback. We have been using a new IT-based customer relationship management system, Salesforce, since 2020. The application helps our sales employees to provide customer support and simplifies their work. Above and beyond this, we have intensified cooperation with our customers to leverage\n\ninnovation and growth potential together with them. For instance, we established interdisciplinary teams in our business units to even better and more quickly address the needs of our most important customers.\n\nBASF's strategic orientation is founded on a comprehensive analysis of our markets and competitors. We continuously monitor global trends and anticipate the resulting growth opportunities and risks. The following six strategic focus areas enable us to focus on our customers while strengthening our leading position in an increasingly volatile and competitive environment.\n\n## Innovation\n\nInnovation is the bedrock of our success. BASF is a leader in the chemical industry with around 10,000/uni00A0 employ ees in research and development and R&D spending of around \u20ac2.2/uni00A0 billion. We are expand ing this position by strengthening specific research activities, for example in battery materials, polymer technologies, catalyst processes or biotechnological methods. In addition, we are bringing research and development even closer together, incorporating our customers' requirements into our innovation processes even earlier and more intensively, and expanding cooperation with customers, universities, research institutions and other partners. To further strengthen our innovation power, we will reorganize our global research activities in 2022 and bundle them in a global research unit based in Ludwigshafen, Germany.\n\nOur innovation pipeline is geared to sustainability - especially climate protection and the circular economy. This lays the foundation for future growth: We are working intensively on fundamental innovations  for  products,  processes  and  business  models,  for example in the chemical recycling of plastics, battery and catalyst technologies, low-carbon production of basic chemicals, and digital,\n\n- 1 The number of customers refers to all external companies (sold-to parties) that had contracts with the BASF/uni00A0Group in the business year concerned under which sales were generated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The virtual car\n\nThe automotive industry is one of our most important customer sectors. In February 2021, we launched an interactive platform that showcases BASF's wide range of solutions and innovation expertise in mobility: Customers can explore over 500 application areas in a new virtual car - from high-performance plastics and coatings to automotive fluids, catalysts, cathode materials and more. Detailed information is provided on all products and solutions. The virtual car offers a selection of different powertrain technologies: combustion engine, plug-in hybrid, battery electric vehicle and fuel cell vehicle. E-mobility solutions can also be filtered by material properties such as battery efficiency, corrosion protection or thermal protection.\n\n- Discover the virtual car at basf-vcar.com\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the same time, we are driving forward product improvements in all business units that offer our customers sustainability and competitive advantages, such as in lightweight construction and surface solutions for the automotive industry, bio-based and biodegradable active ingredients for the cosmetics, detergent and cleaner industries, and energy-efficient building materials.\n\nFor more information on innovation, see page 49 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe believe that the economy, environment and society are inex tricably linked and interrelated. We want to create value in all three areas with our products, solutions and technologies. We pledged our commitment to sustainability in 1994 and since then, have systematically aligned our activities with the principles of sustainability. We want to further strengthen our position as a thought leader in sustainability. We see sustainability as an integral part of our strategy as well as our targets, steering processes and business models. This establishes us as a responsible and attractive partner supporting our customers, opens up new growth areas and secures the long-term success of our company. Our approach covers the entire value chain - from responsible procurement and safety and resource efficiency in production to sustainable solutions for our customers.\n\nSince 1990, we have almost halved our carbon emissions while simultaneously doubling sales product volumes. By 2030, we want to reduce 1 our absolute CO2 emissions by 25% compared with 2018 and will invest up to \u20ac4/uni00A0billion to this end. By 2050, we aim to achieve net zero emissions from our production sites and our energy purchases. We are pursuing ambitious climate protection targets with our carbon management. This comprises five strategic levers that we are systematically driving forward to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions (see page 27). To increase the share of renewables in  our  energy  supply,  for  instance,  we  entered  into  pioneering coopera tion agreements in 2021. For example, we hold a share in\n\nthe  Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm, which Vattenfall expects to commission in 2023. Together with RWE, we are developing a project concept for an offshore wind farm in the North Sea. In addition,  we  have  signed  long-term  purchase  agreements  for renewable  energy with suppliers such as \u00d8rsted and Engie.\n\nAnother focus is our product portfolio. We already met our 2025 target of generating Accelerator sales of \u20ac22/uni00A0billion in 2021. In the future, we want to align our product portfolio even more strongly with climate protection, carbon neutrality and circularity in order to meet the growing sustainability demands in our markets with innovative solutions. Consequently, we will update our product portfolio steering target in 2022.\n\n- For more information on energy and climate protection, see page 126 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on circular economy, see pages 44 and 142\n\nFor more information on Accelerator products und Sustainable Solution Steering, see pages 45 and 141\n\n## Production\n\nOur core business is the production and processing of chemicals. Our strength here lies - both now and in the future - in the Verbund and its integrated value chains. The Verbund offers us many technological, market, production-related and digital advantages. Our comprehensive product portfolio, which ranges from basic chemicals to tailored system solutions, enables us to meet the increas ingly diverse needs of our customers with a differentiated offering. This is complemented by our global presence, coupled with our many decades of experience, which have allowed us to develop an in-depth  understanding  of  the  needs  and  landscape  of  local markets.\n\nOur  integrated  Verbund  structure  enables  efficient,  reliable  and carbon- optimized steering of our production activities. In 2021, for example, we avoided 7.3/uni00A0 million metric tons of CO2 worldwide through the intelligent networking of our plants and combined heat and power generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe plan to invest \u20ac25.6 /uni00A0billion worldwide between now and 2026 to expand capacities based on market demand and to further increase the availability, efficiency and flexibility of our plants. Our aim here is to be close to our customers and to grow together with them.\n\n- For more information on our production sites and the Verbund structure, see page 20\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digitalization\n\nWe want to leverage the diverse growth potential of digitalization and seize the associated opportunities to the benefit of our customers. To achieve this, we promote digital skills among our employees, cooperate with partners and make digital technologies and ways of working an integral part of our business. For example, we had introduced augmented reality solutions at 340 plants worldwide as of the end of 2021. We plan to implement these at more than 80/uni00A0other plants by the end of 2022.\n\nDigitalizing our plants and systematically analyzing data enables us to further automate processes and in this way, increase the  capacity, availability and efficiency of our plants, for example with predictive maintenance. Linking data from different sources and using artificial intelligence for smart data analysis opens up numerous opportunities for us to manage our business more efficiently and improve our processes, for example in logistics.\n\nThe combination of products, services and digital offerings also opens up new business models and advantages for our customers, such as in agriculture or 3D printing. In addition, digitalization  enables us to further strengthen our innovative power. BASF has one of the most powerful supercomputers in the chemical industry - Quriosity. It can be used to significantly accelerate complex computational processes  such  as  the  simulation  of  molecules,  enabling  new chemi cal products to be developed more quickly, for example. At the same time, we are already working on groundbreaking tech nologies such as quantum computing, including as a founding",

In 2021, we successfully integrated the polyamide business acquired from Solvay, further strengthening our position in engineering plastics. We closed the divestiture of our pigments business to the fine chemicals company DIC as planned in the first half of 2021. The sale of our shareholding in Solenis to Platinum Equity was also completed as planned in November 2021. We intend to close the divestiture of our kaolin minerals business to KaMin, announced in November 2021, in the second half of 2022, subject to the approval of the relevant merger control authorities.\n\nWe steer our six segments along our value chains. Our operating divisions drive forward our industry and customer orientation with differentiated strategies.\n\nThe Asian market will play a key role in our future growth. With a share of more than 45%, China is already the world's largest chemical market and will be an even stronger driver of growth in global chemical production in the future. Our strong innovation, production and sales base in Asia, and in particular in China, enables us to respond to the needs of our customers in a differentiated way. To further strengthen our position in this dynamic growth market, we plan to build a second Verbund site in China, in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Construction on the first plants continued as planned in 2021. They are scheduled for startup in 2022. We will also expand the Verbund site we operate together with Sinopec in Nanjing, China, by 2023. This investment includes new production plants for selected products in the Petrochemicals and Intermediates divisions.\n\nWe are expanding our battery materials business with further investments and strategic partnerships and are developing innovative recycling concepts, in particular to supply the fast-growing global e-mobility market with sustainable solutions. We are currently building a precursor plant for cathode active materials 1 in Harjavalta, Finland, and a production plant for cathode materials 2 in Schwarzheide, Germany. Both plants are scheduled for startup in 2022. In Schwarzheide, we are also building a prototype plant for battery recycling, which is expected to start up in 2023. 2 We also reached another important milestone in the development of a global value chain for battery materials with the formation of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd. in China at the end of August 2021. With production facilities in all key regions and a global capacity of 160 metric kilotons of cathode materials from 2022 onward, we are able to serve cell manufacturers and OEM customers in all relevant markets with tailored and sustainable solutions. We also entered into a number of cooperative agreements in 2021, including with battery cell manufacturers such as CATL and SVOLT and automotive manufacturers such as Porsche. The aim is to jointly drive forward the development  of  innovative  cathode  materials  and  recycling technologies.\n\nThe transition to electromobility is leading to fundamental changes in the automotive industry. As a leading chemical supplier to the automotive industry, we will further strengthen our focus on battery materials and battery recycling. To this end, in January 2022, we started the carve-out process for our mobile emissions catalysts business, automotive catalysts recycling and the associated precious  metal  services  unit.  The  new,  standalone  organizational structure prepares the business for the upcoming changes in the internal combustion engine market.\n\nFor more information on material investments and portfolio measures, see page 38 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The investment in Finland is co-financed by Business Finland, the Finnish government organization for innovation funding and trade, travel and investment promotion.\n- 2 Our investment and research activities in Schwarzheide and Ludwigshafen, Germany, receive funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action and the Ministry for Economic Affairs, Labor and Energy of the German state of Brandenburg under the IPCEI on Batteries (funding code 16BZF101A/B).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees\n\nOur employees are key to BASF's success.

Kathrin Michel's team, for example, is looking at how charging times can be shortened, ranges increased and battery life improved. Find out more about how BASF is contributing to climate-smart mobility in the online report at  report.basf.com.\n\n## In focus:\n\n## Global Trends and Growth Opportunities for BASF\n\nIt is important for us to understand which global trends will shape the future. On this basis, we can identify opportunities, align our strategies and operations, monitor risks and create value added for our stakeholders.\n\nThe transition  to  a  climate-neutral  society is  the  greatest challenge of the coming decades. Many of our products and technologies  are  key  to  this  transformation.  For  example,  we  are developing innovative battery materials, lightweight materials, and additives for climate-smart mobility. Catalysts and other emission control technologies from BASF reduce emissions in many applications. Materials from BASF make buildings more energy efficient and generating power from wind and solar energy possible. We help farmers reduce carbon emissions with our integrated offering of seeds, crop protection and digital solutions. We are continuously expanding our portfolio of climate protection products. At the same time, we are working hard to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of our production and our products in our carbon management.\n\nPopulation growth and rising prosperity will increase demand for food, household and personal care products, drugs, clothing and much more. At the same time, consumer behavior is changing. Sustainability aspects are playing an increasingly important role in our value chains. Our innovative solutions for agriculture enable higher yields from the same land area, contributing to a food supply that meets diverse economic, environmental and social requirements. We offer food and feed manufacturers and customers in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, detergents and cleaners industries a product portfolio focused on sustainability, which we are continually expanding with bio-based and biodegradable solutions.\n\nGrowing resource scarcity means that resources and materials must be used responsibly. We develop and market innovative technologies and products in a wide variety of areas to keep recyclable materials in circulation for as long as possible. Going forward, we will align our business models, products and processes even more strongly with the circular economy. For example, we are driving forward the chemical recycling of plastics and improving mechanical recycling with new products and technologies. Other action areas include the use of renewable and recycled raw materials and the recovery of metals from spent batteries and catalytic converters.\n\nDigitalization and connectivity offer many opportunities to optimize our processes: maintenance work can be planned in advance, innovation processes accelerated or logistics concepts and customer relationships improved. In addition, new business models are opening up, for example in agriculture or with products for the electronics and semiconductor industries.\n\nIn the emerging countries of Asia and South America , we have an innovation, production and sales base that has grown over several decades. We are strengthening this position with further investments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the period from 2022 to 2026, we are planning capital expenditures (capex) 1 totaling \u20ac25.6/uni00A0 billion, including \u20ac12.9/uni00A0 billion for our major growth projects. 2\n\nFor more information on our investments from 2022 onward, see page 150\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investments and acquisitions 2021\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                 | Invest- ments   |   Acquisi-  tions | Total   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Intangible assets               | 78              |               392 | 470     |\n| of which goodwill               | -               |               254 | 254     |\n| Property, plant and equipment a | 4,078           |               332 | 4,410   |\n| Total                           | 4,156           |               725 | 4,881   |\n\n- a Including restoration obligations, IT investments and right-of-use assets arising from leases\n\nWith a world market share of over 45%, China is already the largest chemical market and will drive growth in global chemical production to an even greater extent in the future. We expect China's share to increase to over 50% by 2030. To further strengthen our position in Asia, we plan to build a new integrated Verbund site in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. The first plants started construction in 2020, and we made further progress on these in 2021. They are scheduled for startup in 2022. We will also expand the Verbund site we operate together with Sinopec in Nanjing,  China, by 2023.\n\nIn addition, we are refining our portfolio through acquisitions that promise above-average profitable growth as part of the BASF/uni00A0Verbund to help reach a relevant market position. A key consideration is that these are innovation-driven or offer a technological differentiation,  and  make  new,  sustainable  business  models  possible. Investments and acquisitions alike are prepared by interdisciplinary teams and assessed using various criteria. In this way, we ensure that economic, environmental and social concerns are included in strategic decision-making.\n\n## Investments in the segments and regions\n\nInvestments  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  amounted  to \u20ac4,078/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: \u20ac3,516/uni00A0million). Capex accounted for \u20ac3,363 million of this amount (2020: \u20ac2,878/uni00A0 million). Our investments  in  2021  focused  on  the  Chemicals,  Materials,  Surface Technologies and Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segments.\n\n- 1 Additions to property, plant and equipment excluding acquisitions, restoration obligations, IT investments and right-of-use assets arising from leases\n- 2 Major growth projects are the construction of our future Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, as well as our battery materials activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Additions to property, plant and equipment a by segment in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Additions to property, plant and equipment a by region in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a Including restoration obligations, IT investments and right-of-use assets arising from leases",

In 2021, for example, we increased the production capacity for tertiary butylamine. Together with our partner Sinopec, we are pushing ahead with plans to further expand the site in Nanjing, China, to strengthen the joint production of chemical products in China. For instance, we plan to further expand our production capacities for propionic aldehyde, propionic acid, purified ethylene oxide, ethanolamines and ethyleneamines, and build a new tert-butyl acrylate plant. The expanded and new plants are scheduled to come onstream in 2023.\n\nAt  our  Verbund  site  in  Antwerp,  Belgium,  we  are  significantly expanding  our  ethylene  oxide  plant.  The  project  also  includes several downstream plants, for example, to produce surfactants. The expansion is scheduled to come onstream in 2022.\n\n## Materials\n\nIn the Materials segment, production capacities at the methylene diphenyl isocyanate (MDI) plants in Geismar, Louisiana, were successfully increased by one third following the construction of a new MDI synthesis unit, which was completed with the start of operations in 2020. In the final phase, we plan to increase capacities to around 600,000/uni00A0 metric/uni00A0 tons per year by 2026. With this gradual capacity expansion, we are supporting the continuing growth of our North American MDI customers.\n\nThe construction of the first plants at our smart Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, is in progress. The new plants are scheduled to come onstream in 2022. They will produce engineering plastics and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) to serve the increasing needs of various growth industries in the southern China market and in other Asian markets.\n\nBASF  is  investing  in  a  new  world-scale  production  plant  for hexamethylened iamine (HMD) at the Chalamp\u00e9 site in France.

Production is expected to start in 2024.\n\n## Industrial/uni00A0Solutions\n\nIn the Industrial/uni00A0 Solutions segment, we are increasing global production capacity for the antioxidant Irganox \u00ae 1010 through a project to expand production at the site in Jurong, Singapore. With the completion of the project in 2022, BASF aims to better serve the growing demand from customers in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In addition, we increased production capacity for the antioxidant  Irganox \u00ae 1520L  by  20%  at  the  site  in  Pontecchio Marconi, Italy, in the first/uni00A0quarter/uni00A0of/uni00A02021.\n\nTo meet the increasing demand for high-quality dispersions solutions in the growing ASEAN, Australian and New Zealand markets, we have doubled the production capacity for acrylics dispersions in Pasir Gudang, Malaysia. The additional capacities started up in the first quarter of 2021. We are currently building our third electronicgrade sulfuric acid plant in Jiaxing, China. This investment will more than double BASF's existing sulfuric acid production capacity in the country to serve the rapidly growing semiconductor industry. The site expansion is scheduled for completion in 2023.\n\n## Surface Technologies\n\nWe aim to expand our position as a leading and innovative provider of battery materials and benefit from the strong growth in this market segment. A global, customer-focused production network for battery materials is crucial here. Construction of our new production plant for cathode materials in Schwarzheide, Germany, continued as planned in 2021. The new plant will use precursors from the production facility under construction in Harjavalta, Finland. The two plants are scheduled for startup in 2022 and will produce cathode active materials for around 20 gigawatt hours of cell capacity per year. With these investments in Finland and Germany, BASF aims to become the first cathode active materials supplier with local\n\nproduction capacities in what are currently the main markets: China, Japan, North America and Europe.\n\nIn addition, BASF announced in 2021 that it will build a battery recycling prototype plant in Schwarzheide, Germany. Startup is planned for 2023. The prototype plant will allow for the development of operating procedures and optimization of technology to deliver superior returns of lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese from endof-life lithium-ion batteries.\n\n## Nutrition/uni00A0& Care\n\nIn Ludwigshafen, Germany, we started up the expanded vitamin A production facilities for the Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segment in July 2021. We also invested in the expansion of alkoxylate capacities at the Verbund site in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nBy mid-2022, BASF will increase its capacities for methane sulfonic acid by around 65% in response to growing cross-industry demand, strengthening its position as a leading global producer. To this end, we are investing in the construction of a new methane sulfonic acid plant at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany. Methane sulfonic acid is an organic acid used in numerous applications ranging from chemical and biofuel synthesis to industrial cleaning and metal surface treatment in the electronics industry.\n\n## Agricultural Solutions\n\nThe investment in a formulation hub for crop protection products in Singapore will, from 2022 onward, ensure that multiple formulation technologies are produced in close proximity to farmers in Asia Pacific. We also invested in the expansion of our production site in Sparks, Georgia, establishing a new formulation plant for seed treatment products, which came into operation in 2021. At the Nunhem site in the Netherlands, we continued the expansion of our breeding facilities for vegetable seeds with a state-of-the-art tomato greenhouse, which has been available since 2021. Further\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninvestments were made in the modernization of site infrastructure in North America. To meet continuing high demand for our innovative solutions in the future, between 2022 and 2026, we will invest more than \u20ac950/uni00A0 million in developing and expanding our infrastructure, including state-of-the-art R&D facilities, and in our production and formulation capacities for active ingredients as well as for seed solutions.\n\n- For more information on our segments, see page 72 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New Verbund site in Zhanjiang\n\nBased on its goal of net zero emissions by 2050, BASF has made further progress toward reducing its carbon footprint. In June/uni00A0 2021, we signed a purchase agreement for renewable electricity  with  China  Resources  Power,  Hong  Kong,  China, under the new Guangdong renewable energy trading rules in China. This will enable us to run the first plants at BASF's new Verbund site in Zhanjiang entirely on renewable energy. The new plants are scheduled for startup in late 2022. This is a significant step toward transforming of our energy supply in China.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiscover the smart Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, at basf.com/zhanjiang",

The newly formed entity is majority-owned by BASF (BASF 51%; Shanshan 49%). It has four sites in Hunan and Ningxia, China, with more than 1,600/uni00A0employees. BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co.,/uni00A0Ltd. will focus primarily on the rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) market while serving global consumer electronic and energy storage market segments. The business is a part of the Catalysts division.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on this acquisition, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 207 onward\n\nFollowing approval of the relevant authorities, we completed the purchase of 49.5% of Vattenfall's Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm on September/uni00A0 1, 2021. 1 The purchase price was \u20ac0.3/uni00A0 billion. Wind farm construction began in July 2021. Once fully operational in 2023, the wind farm will be the largest commercial offshore wind farm in the world. This wind farm does not receive any subsidies for the power produced. On December/uni00A0 6, 2021, BASF and Allianz Capital Partners announced that they had reached an agreement on the purchase of a 25.2% interest by Allianz Capital Partners (see/uni00A0'Agreed transactions').\n\n## Divestitures\n\nOn May/uni00A031, 2021, BASF completed the sale of its production site in Kankakee, Illinois, to a subsidiary of One Rock Capital Partners,/uni00A0LLC. The agreement also includes the vegetable-oil-based sterols and natural vitamin/uni00A0 E business as well as the anionic surfactants and esters produced at the Kankakee site. The purchase price was \u20ac177/uni00A0 million. The transaction affected the Nutrition/uni00A0& Health and Care Chemicals divisions.\n\nOn June/uni00A030, 2021, we closed the divestiture of our global pigments business  to  the  Japanese  fine  chemical  company  DIC,  Tokyo, Japan. The business transfer agreement, which affected around 2,500/uni00A0 employees, was signed on August/uni00A029, 2019. The purchase price on a cash and debt-free basis was \u20ac1.15/uni00A0billion. The Dispersions  &  Pigments  division  was  renamed  Dispersions  &  Resins following the transaction closing.\n\n- For more information on this divestiture, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 209 onward\n\nOn November/uni00A09, 2021, BASF and Clayton, Dubilier/uni00A0& Rice sold their shares in Solenis to Platinum Equity, a private equity company based in Beverly Hills, California. With over 5,200/uni00A0 employees, Solenis serves customers in water-intensive industries by helping them solve complex water treatment and process improvement challenges. BASF held a 49% share in Solenis after transferring its paper and water chemicals business to the company in February 2019. This was reported as a non-integral investment accounted for using the equity method. The remaining 51% of the shares were held by funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier/uni00A0& Rice, and by Solenis management. The purchase price attributable to BASF was \u20ac1.1/uni00A0 billion.\n\nOn November/uni00A0 30, 2021, we completed the sale of the precision microchemicals business to Entegris.

The divestiture comprises the production hub with sites in Daveyville, Toddville, Edgar, Gordon and related mines, reserves and mills in Toomsboro and Sandersville in Georgia. The refinery catalysts operations located at the same site are not part of the divestiture. Pending approval by the relevant authorities, closing of the transaction is expected in the second half of 2022.\n\nOn December/uni00A06, 2021, BASF and Allianz Capital Partners, on behalf of Allianz Insurance Companies (Allianz), announced that they had reached an agreement on the purchase of 25.2% of the Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ) wind farm by Allianz. This follows a transaction between Vattenfall and BASF under which BASF acquired 49.5% of HKZ from Vattenfall on September/uni00A01, 2021. BASF will continue to receive most of the power produced by its originally acquired share of 49.5% of HKZ under a long-term fixed-price corporate power purchasing agreement. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to the approval of the relevant merger control authorities.\n\nOn December/uni00A028, 2021, BASF reached an agreement to divest its production site in Quincy, Florida, and the associated attapulgite business to Clariant for a purchase price of $60/uni00A0million.

        "page_content": "## Our Steering Concept\n\nCreating long-term value as a company means more than generating earnings that cover the cost of capital employed. Our steering concept encourages and supports all employees in thinking and acting entrepreneurially. Our key financial management indicator is the return on capital employed (ROCE). The BASF/uni00A0Group's most important nonfinancial key performance indicators are CO2 emissions and Accelerator sales.\n\nOur financial targets follow a steering concept that is aligned with our values. The return on capital employed (ROCE) is used as the key target and management indicator for the BASF/uni00A0 Group. As stated in our strategic goals, we aim to achieve a ROCE considerably above the cost of capital percentage every year. With ROCE, the same logic and data is used for our value-based management, external  communication  with  the  capital  markets  and  variable compensation. This means we use the same yardstick for internal manage ment,  employee  incentivization  and  our  shareholders' expectations.\n\nAs part of our corporate strategy and the sustainability targets derived from this, we have also used CO2 emissions and Accelerator sales as the most important nonfinancial key performance indicators since the 2020 business year. Two targets are based on these indicators: sustainability-oriented portfolio management with our Sustain able Solution Steering method and reducing absolute CO2 emissions. We reached our Accelerator sales target in 2021, earlier than planned. Consequently, we will adjust our portfolio steering target over the course of 2022.\n\n## Calculating ROCE and cost of capital\n\nROCE is calculated as the EBIT of the segments as a percentage of the average cost of capital basis.\n\nTo calculate the EBIT of the segments , we take the BASF/uni00A0Group's EBIT and deduct the EBIT of activities recognized under Other, which are not allocated to the divisions.\n\nThe cost of capital basis is calculated using the month-end figures and consists of the operating assets of the segments. These comprise the current and noncurrent asset items of the segments, including tangible and intangible fixed assets, integral investments accounted for using the equity method, inventories, trade accounts receivable, other receivables and other assets generated by core business activities and, where appropriate, the assets of disposal groups. The cost of capital basis also includes customer and supplier financing.\n\nWe  have  integrated  the cost  of  capital  percentage into  our ROCE target as a comparative figure. This is determined using the weighted cost of capital from equity and borrowing costs (weighted average cost of capital, WACC). To calculate a pre-tax figure similar to EBIT, the cost of capital is adjusted using the projected tax rate for the BASF/uni00A0Group for the business year. In addition, the projected net expense of Other is already provided for by an adjustment to the cost of capital percentage. The cost of equity is ascertained using the capital asset pricing model. Borrowing costs are determined\n\nbased on the financing costs of the BASF Group. The cost of capital percentage for 2022 is 9% (2021: 9%).\n\n## Calculation of CO2 emissions\n\nWe calculate our absolute CO2 emissions on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions, which are the sum of direct emissions from production processes and the generation of steam and electricity (Scope/uni00A01), as well as indirect emissions from the purchase of energy (Scope/uni00A02). Direct emissions from the generation of energy for third parties are not considered here. Relevant emissions include other greenhouse  gases  according  to  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents.\n\nWe set ourselves even more ambitious targets with our roadmap to climate neutrality, which we presented in March/uni00A02021: Compared with  the  2018  baseline,  we  want  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions by 25% by 2030. 1 We aim to achieve net zero emissions (Scope/uni00A01 and Scope/uni00A02) by 2050.\n\nFor more information on CO2 emissions and our climate protection targets, see page 126 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accelerator products make a substantial sustainability contribution in the value chain. In line with our corporate strategy, we set ourselves the global target of achieving \u20ac22/uni00A0billion in Accelerator sales by 2025. This target was already achieved in 2021. Consequently, we will adjust our portfolio steering target over the course of 2022.\n\nFor more information on sustainability-oriented portfolio management, see page 141 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Value-based management throughout the company\n\nAn important part of our value management is the target agreement process,  which  aligns  individual  employee  targets  with  BASF's targets. The most important financial performance indicator in the operating units is ROCE. The other units' contribution to value is also assessed according to effectiveness and efficiency on the basis of quality and cost targets. To assess this, we use metrics such as BASF's internal service score in the service units.\n\nIn addition to ROCE as the BASF/uni00A0Group's most important financial key performance indicator, we use EBIT before special items and capex (capital expenditure) as key performance indicators that have a direct impact on ROCE and as such, support its management.\n\n- -EBIT before special items is used to steer profitability at Group and  segment  level.  This  is  calculated  by  adjusting  the  EBIT reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements for special items,  making  it  especially  suitable  for  assessing  economic develop ment over time. Special items arise from the integration of  acquired  businesses,  from  restructuring  measures,  certain impairments, gains or losses resulting from divestitures and sales of shareholdings, and other expenses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities.\n\n- -Capital  expenditures (capex)  are  used  to  manage  capital employed  in  the  BASF/uni00A0 Group.  These  comprise  additions  to property, plant and equipment excluding additions from acquisitions,  IT  investments,  restoration  obligations  and  right-of-use assets arising from leases. Capex is not just relevant to ROCE management, but also supports our long-term goal of increasing our dividend each year based on a strong free cash flow.\n\nFurthermore, we comment on and forecast sales at Group and segment level in our financial reporting as a significant driver for EBIT before special items and thus ROCE.\n\n- For more information on the development of these indicators, see Results of Operations from page 56 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

One example is chemical recycling. Find out more about how used tires and mixed plastic waste are converted into new raw materials in the online report at report.basf.com.\n\n## In focus:\n\n## Thinking and Acting Circular\n\nAs the world's population grows, so does demand for limited natural resources. At the same time, many recyclable materials end up in landfill or in waste incineration. New concepts are needed to decouple growth from resource consumption. Reduce, reuse and recycle are the keywords of this transition to a system of more sustainable product cycles with less resource consumption and lower carbon emissions.\n\nThe concept of conserving resources, recycling and feeding waste back into the system is not new for BASF. As early as 1865, it underpinned  the  foundation  of  our  company:  At  that  time,  Friedrich Engelhorn pursued the idea of producing synthetic dyes from coal tar - a waste product - and organizing production efficiently in an integrated Verbund structure . We are still committed to this tradition today and are aligning our actions more strongly than ever with circularity. The chemical industry is doubly important for the transition to a circular economy. Firstly because many value chains start here.  And  secondly  because  many  products  and  technologies based on chemistry help to close loops. That is why both aspects - switching to renewable raw materials and innovations for more circularity - are core elements of our Circular Economy Program.\n\nFor example, we already use bio-based and renewable raw materials in our production (see page 113). To further reduce the resource and carbon footprints of our products and solutions, we will align our raw material base even more strongly toward recycled and renewable  raw  materials.  For  instance,  we  aim  to  process 250,000/uni00A0 metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials in our production plants annually from 2025. Together with partners, we are analyzing waste streams and raw material sources to find the best solution and develop suitable, innovative processes (see page /uni00A0115). This is the case, for example, in the chemical recycling of used tires and different types of plastics, where we can feed recovered raw materials such as pyrolysis oil or monomers back into our Verbund structure at different points. Another example is\n\nthe recovery of valuable metals from spent batteries and catalytic converters.\n\nIn addition, we are developing innovative products and technologies in many areas that will increase the service life of materials or their recyclability and compostability. One example is additives for the mechanical recycling of plastics. A Group-wide co-funding program supports our employees in developing new business models for the circular economy - from the initial idea to market launch. Our target: By 2030, we want to double our sales of solutions for the circular economy to \u20ac17/uni00A0billion. These are products that are based on alternative raw materials, that close material loops or increase the resource efficiency and durability of products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on recycled raw materials, see page 115 onward\n\nFor more information on sustainable solutions and the circular economy, see page 141 onward\n\n## Our circular economy targets\n\n## 250,000/uni00A0metric tons\n\nRecycled and waste-based raw materials processed every year from 2025\n\n## \u20ac17/uni00A0billion\n\nSales of solutions for the circular economy by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->",

We secure our long-term success with products, solutions and technologies that create value added for the environment, society and the economy.\n\n## Our strategic approach\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Sustainability aspects integrated into corporate steering\n- /uni25AA Targets for climate protection, product portfolio, circular economy, procurement, safety and employees\n- /uni25AA Strategic guidelines on stakeholder management and our societal engagement\n\nSustainability is at the core of what we do and a driver for growth and value. Analyzing our contributions to sustainability also enables us to manage risks effectively. We pursue a holistic sustainability approach that covers the entire value chain - from our suppliers and our own activities to our customers. We have formulated commitments for our conduct along the value chain and underpinned these with corresponding targets and measures (see page 36).\n\nBased on our corporate strategy and the global targets derived from this, we steer the sustainability targets (reduce absolute CO2 emissions 1 by 25% by 2030 compared with baseline 2018 and achieve \u20ac22 billion in Accelerator 2 sales by 2025) as most important key performance indicators. To this end, we have established the necessary steering mechanisms and control systems at Group level. Our global activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include using renewable energies for both electricity and steam production, developing and applying new low-carbon production processes,\n\nusing renewable raw materials, and ongoing measures to further increase  energy  and  resource  efficiency  in  our  production  (see page/uni00A0 126). We use the Sustainable Solution Steering method to improve  the  sustainability  contributions  of  our  product  portfolio along the value chain (see page/uni00A0141). To assess the sustainability performance of our products and identify solutions with a substantial sustainability contribution in the value chain, we regularly reassess our product portfolio. We already reached our 2025 sales target for Accelerator products in 2021. Consequently, we will update our product portfolio steering target over the course of 2022.\n\nIn addition to the climate protection and Accelerator sales targets, we have set ourselves further sustainability goals. A particular focus is the circular economy due to its strong connection to climate protection. We have defined further targets on water management, responsible procurement, engaged employees, women in leadership positions, occupational health and safety, and process safety.\n\nWe have also set up a project organization to achieve our climate protection targets. The new Net Zero Accelerator unit concentrates on implementing and accelerating projects on low-carbon production technologies, the circular economy and renewable energies.\n\nAs a co-founder of the U.N. Global Compact and a recognized LEAD company, we contribute to the implementation of the United Nations' Agenda 2030. Our products, solutions and technologies help to achieve the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),\n\n- 1 The target includes Scope/uni00A01 and Scope/uni00A02 emissions. Other greenhouse gases are converted into CO2 equivalents in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. In March 2021, we replaced our previous target of CO2-neutral growth until 2030 (baseline 2018: 21.9/uni00A0million metric tons of CO2e) with a new, more ambitious climate protection target to reduce absolute CO2 emissions by 25% compared with 2018 (new target: 16.4/uni00A0million metric tons of CO2e).\n- 2 Accelerator products make a substantial sustainability contribution in the value chain.\n\nespecially SDG/uni00A0 2 (Zero hunger), SDG/uni00A0 5 (Gender equality), SDG/uni00A0 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG/uni00A07 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG/uni00A08 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG/uni00A0 13 (Climate action). To prioritize these, internal experts assessed the impacts and positive contributions of our products, our corporate targets and strategic action areas. The Value to Society method is used to measure the contribution of our activities along the value chain. This assesses our positive and negative impacts on the environment, society and the economy (see page 47).\n\nWe identify key sustainability topics with our comprehensive materiality analysis . The graphic on page 46 shows how we assess relevant topics. Here, we take into account topics that we have an impact on, topics that have an impact on us, and topics that our stakeholders consider important to us. The topics identified based on these three dimensions of materiality are: climate and energy, health and safety / product stewardship, water, emissions to air and soil, resource efficiency and waste, biodiversity, human rights, employment and diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on our materiality analysis, see basf.com/materiality\n\nFor more information on the metastudy on sustainability trends, see basf.com/sustainability-trends\n\n<!-- image -->",

Together with decentrally organized specialists, the Corporate Strategy & Sustainability unit in the Corporate Center is responsible for integrating sustainability into core business activities and decision-making processes. This unit's tasks include the global steering of climate-related matters.\n\nThe new Net Zero Accelerator project organization has reported directly to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors since January 2022. It focuses on the further acceleration and implementation of existing and new projects to achieve CO2 reduction targets at company level worldwide and drives them forward.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board are regularly briefed on the current status of individual sustainability topics. The Board of Executive Directors incorporates the results and recommendations from sustainability evaluations of business processes into its decisions, for example, on proposed investments and acquisitions. It makes decisions with strategic relevance for the Group and monitors the implementation of strategic plans and target  achievement.  The  Corporate  Sustainability  Board,  which  is composed of heads of business and Corporate Center units and regions, supports the Board of Executive Directors on sustainability topics and discusses operational matters. A member of the Board of Executive Directors serves as chair.\n\nWe systematically evaluate sustainability criteria , including the effects of climate change, as an integral part of decisions on acquisitions and investments in property, plant and equipment or financial assets. In this way, we not only assess economic dimensions, but also the potential impacts on areas such as the environment, human rights or the local community.

We aim to increase  our  positive  contributions  and  minimize  the  negative impacts of our business activities. To achieve this, we need to understand how our actions and our products impact society and the environment.\n\nWe already have many years of experience in this area from evaluating  our  products  and  processes  using  methods  such  as  EcoEfficiency Analyses, the SEEbalance \u00ae Socio-Eco-Efficiency Analysis, our Sustainable Solution Steering portfolio analysis, BASF's corporate carbon footprint or the calculation of Product Carbon Footprints.\n\nWe want to holistically capture the value we contribute to society along the value chain and make this transparent. However, there are still no uniform, global standards for measuring and reporting on companies' overall impact that cover economic, environmental and social aspects of business activities along the value chain. This is why we developed the Value to Society method in 2013 together with external experts. We can use this methodological approach to compare  the  significance  of  financial  and  sustainability-related impacts of our business activities on society and show their interdependencies.  The  results  illustrate  the  positive  contributions  and negative effects, both at BASF and in our value chains. Positive factors include taxes paid, wages, social benefits, employee training and our net income. 1 Negative contributions include environmental impacts such as carbon emissions, land use and emissions to air, soil and water, as well as health and safety incidents. The positive impacts of our economic activities declined in 2020, 2 primarily due to the  economic  conditions  caused  by  the  coronavirus  pandemic, which led to lower economic value added. In addition, higher water consumption  and  increased  land  use  in  supplier  and  customer industries had a greater impact on the environment.\n\nOverall, the Value to Society method helps us to continually monitor our progress. It complements existing concepts for assessing risks and business opportunities by providing a macro perspective and enables us to derive the necessary business steps.\n\nWe are a founding member of the value balancing alliance e.V. (VBA) and have contributed our knowledge and experience to this crossindustry initiative. We support the development of an accounting and reporting  standard  that  makes  the  value  companies  provide  to society transparent and comparable. The aim is to present the financial, ecological, and social impacts of business activities on the basis of a standardized framework. The VBA is supported by major auditing firms, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), leading universities and other partners. Together with the OECD and the Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition, we are pushing to further expand the social indicators. Here, BASF leads  the  Impact  Measurement  working  group  together  with partners. Through the VBA, we are involved in the E.U.'s Platform on Sustainable Finance. Together with the VBA and other partners, we supported  the  establishment  of  the  International  Sustainability Standard Board (ISSB), are involved in the work of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and are part of the G7 Impact Taskforce. Our Corporate Finance unit is also involved in the work of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's (EFRAG) Project Task Force on European sustainability reporting standards.\n\nThe method developed by the VBA was enhanced and refined on the basis of feedback from the scientific community and member companies. Amendments include the addition of two social indicators and the calculation of downstream impacts, as well as revisions to financial indicators, for example.

Parts of our business activities, such as the use of certain new technologies or our environmental impacts, are often viewed by stakeholders with a critical eye. We take these questions seriously, initiate dialogs and participate in discussions. Such ongoing exchange with our stakeholders helps us to even better understand what matters to groups of society, what they expect of us and which measures we need to pursue in order to establish and maintain trust, build partnerships, and increase societal acceptance for and the sustainability of our business activities. In doing so, we want to harness potential for mutual value creation and strengthen societal acceptance of our business activities. For important topics, we systematically identify key stakeholders at an early stage to discuss critical questions with them. Relevant considerations here include their topic-specific expertise and willingness to engage in constructive dialog.\n\nWe  established  an  external,  independent  Stakeholder  Advisory Council (SAC) in 2013 and the Human Rights Advisory Council (HRAC) in 2020. In the SAC, which is led by the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, international experts from academia and society contribute their perspectives to discussions with BASF's Board of Executive Directors. The HRAC is an advisory body comprising external human rights specialists and internal experts. This helps us to critically reflect on our positions and address potential for improvement.",

Innovations based on chemistry play a pivotal role in overcoming these. That is why we are working together with our customers on  innovative processes, technologies and products for a more sustainable future.\n\n## At a glance\n\n## \u20ac2.2/uni00A0billion\n\nResearch and development expenses\n\n~820\n\nNew patents filed\n\n- /uni25AA Close cooperation between research and business units\n- /uni25AA Focus on customers' needs and requirements\n- /uni25AA Close cooperation with universities, research institutes and companies\n\nInnovation has always been the key to BASF's success. The knowledge and skills of our highly qualified employees is our most valuable resource here and the source of our innovative strength. We had approximately 10,000 employees involved in research and development worldwide in 2021.\n\nOur research  and  development  expenses amounted  to \u20ac2,216/uni00A0 mil lion  in  2021  (2020:  \u20ac2,086/uni00A0 million).  Research  and development activities in our operating divisions, which is mainly application and customer-related, accounted for 83% of this figure. Corporate research, in which we bundle cross-divisional and longterm topics, was responsible for 17% of these expenses.\n\nOur innovation focus is on developing sustainable solutions for our customers. We ensure our long-term competitiveness by helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint, use resources more efficiently, or manufacture products in a more environmentally  friendly way and to recycle them, to name a few examples.\n\nIn 2021, we generated sales of over \u20ac11/uni00A0 billion with products launched on the market in the past five years that stemmed from research and development activities. In the long term, we aim to continue significantly increasing sales and earnings with new and improved products - especially with products that make a substantial sustainability contribution in the value chain (see page 141).\n\nOur central research is currently divided into three global divisions, run  from  Europe,  Asia  Pacific  and  North  America:  Process Research/uni00A0 &  Chemical  Engineering  (Ludwigshafen,  Germany); Advanced Materials/uni00A0 & Systems Research (Shanghai, China); and Bioscience Research (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina).\n\nWe have already brought our research and development units closer together over the past few years. We will reorganize our global research activities in 2022 to further strengthen our innovation performance  and  respond  to  our  customers'  industry-specific requirements even better and more quickly going forward. Business and application-driven research units that are currently allocated to the three corporate research divisions will be integrated into the operating divisions, aligning them even more closely with the needs of our customers. The aim is to further shorten the time to market for new products and accelerate BASF's organic growth. Research activities that are relevant to several operating divisions will be bundled in a central research division steered from Ludwigshafen, Germany. This unit will continue to be globally organized with research  centers  in  Europe,  North  America  and  Asia  Pacific. Together with the development units in our operating divisions, it forms the core of our global Know-How Verbund.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will continue to use corporate funding to finance research of broad relevance to the BASF/uni00A0Group that goes beyond the industryspecific focus of the individual operating divisions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are driving forward the development of new business areas. For example, we are developing innovative coating technologies and materials that make innovative surfaces and functions possible. Functional films can be used to reduce the frictional resistance of surfaces or  improve UV protection and weather resistance, for example. Our innovative solutions help our customers to achieve their sustainability goals.\n\nAs part of our Carbon Management R&D Program, we are carrying out intensive research into pioneering, low-carbon production processes for basic chemicals such as hydrogen (see page 132). This will enable us to offer our customers products with a lower carbon footprint in the future.\n\n## Employees in research and development\n\n## ~ 10,000\n\nOur global research and development presence - and its effectiveness - is vital to our long-term success. This enables us to respond to the needs and requirements of the regional markets in a differentiated way and leverage growth potential.\n\nThe Ludwigshafen site in Germany is and will remain the largest in our Research Verbund. Investments there include a combined laboratory  building  for  cleanroom  and  elemental  analysis.  The  new building's modern digitalization and automation solutions set new standards in safety and efficiency. It is scheduled to open in 2022. In addition, we will build a new Catalyst Development and Solids Processing Center in Ludwigshafen, Germany, by 2024 to bring process innovations and new chemical catalysts to market faster.\n\nWe want to continue advancing our research and development activities, especially in Asia. For instance, in 2021 we started the third expansion phase for the BASF Innovation Campus in  Shanghai, China. With this expansion, BASF will strengthen its research and development capabilities for advanced materials and systems as well as for chemical engineering. Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.\n\nA strong presence outside Europe creates new opportunities for developing and expanding our customer relationships and scientific collaborations as well as for gaining access to talented employees. This  strengthens  our  Research  and  Development  Verbund  and makes BASF an even more attractive partner and employer.\n\nThe number and quality of our patents also attest to our power of innovation and long-term competitiveness. In 2021, we filed around 820 new patents worldwide. The Patent Asset Index, a method that compares patent portfolios, once again ranked us among the leading companies in the chemical industry in 2021.\n\nFor more information on innovation, see basf.com/innovations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global network\n\nOur global network of top universities, research institutes and companies forms an important part of our Know-How Verbund. It gives us direct access to external scientific expertise, talented minds from various disciplines as well as new technologies - and helps us to quickly develop targeted, marketable innovations, strengthen our portfolio with creative new projects, and in this way, reach our growth targets.\n\nOur eight academic research alliances bundle partnerships with several research groups in a region or with a specific research focus.\n\n## Eight Academic Research Alliances\n\nAccess to scientific expertise, talented minds and new technologies\n\nThe  Northeast  Research  Alliance  (NORA)  and  the  California Research Alliance (CARA) are located in the United States . NORA focuses on materials science and biosciences, catalysis research, digitalization and cooperation with startups. Teams at the interdisciplinary CARA research center are working on new functional materials, formulations, digital methods, catalysis, chemical synthesis, and in engineering sciences and biosciences.\n\nThe Joint Research Network on Advanced Materials and Systems (JONAS) is active in Europe and concentrates on supramolecular chemistry, polymer chemistry and the incubation of sustainable technologies. We are working on innovative components and materials for electrochemical energy storage with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) at the Battery and Electrochemistry Laboratory (BELLA). At the joint Catalysis Research Laboratory (CaRLa), BASF is researching homogeneous catalysis in cooperation with the University of Heidelberg. BasCat is a joint laboratory operated by the UniCat cluster of excellence and BASF at the Technical University of Berlin,  where  new  heterogenous  catalysis  concepts  are  being explored together with the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, also based in Berlin. The iL (Innovation Lab) in Heidelberg, Germany, focuses on functional printing, printed sensors and IoT (internet of things) applications.\n\nAt the Network for Asian Open Research (NAO) in the Asia Pacific region, research focuses on polymer and colloid chemistry, catalysis, machine learning and smart manufacturing.\n\nThe Academic Research Alliances are complemented by cooperative partnerships with around 280 universities and research institutes as well as collaborations with a large number of companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To achieve this, we bring together the creativity, experience and expertise of our employees with the know-how of our partners from academia and industry.\n\nRecycling industrial off-gases: Industrial off-gases are usually incinerated or thermally recovered. In both cases, CO2 is emitted. To avoid this and to recycle the main components of the off-gases so they can be used in chemical production, BASF has been researching an innovative process, gas fermentation, with the U.S. startup LanzaTech  since  2018.  The  interdisciplinary  team  achieved  an important breakthrough in 2021: using special bacteria, they were able to produce n-octanol from carbon monoxide and hydrogen for the first time. The molecule is an alcohol and is used in cosmetics, for example. Normally, microorganisms cannot produce n-octanol, which is toxic to them. However, using biotechnological methods, LanzaTech was able to program the organisms to produce and tolerate n-octanol as part of a gas fermentation process. In parallel, BASF researchers developed a process that enables the continuous separation and purification of n-octanol. Following successful implementation in the laboratory, the team is now working on further process  improvements.  Integrating  gas  fermentation  technology into the BASF Verbund could contribute to a carbon- neutral circular economy in the future.\n\nBio-based and biodegradable ingredients: Circular economy and sustainability are also playing an increasingly important role for our customers in the detergent and cleaner industry. That is why interdisciplinary teams at BASF have been working hard on the question of how to optimize cleaning performance and environmental compatibility. The focus here is on new ingredients that can be produced from renewable raw materials and biodegraded at the end of their productive life cycle. This calls for new approaches in   research  and  development.  We  are  developing  a  fundamental understanding of how biodegradation occurs under different\n\nconditions in joint projects with academic partners and closely coordinated laboratory and field research. The additional integration of new digital tools and faster screening and testing methods enables us to shorten our development times and develop highperformance, environmentally compatible ingredients - not only for cleaning purposes, but also for cosmetics and industrial applications such as agrochemicals.\n\nAnimal-free testing methods: The European Union wants to significantly improve the safety of chemical products. BASF supports this goal and has been actively working to make it a reality for many years. For example, in order to meet expanded requirements and additional testing obligations under the E.U.'s Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability in the future, we are developing innovative in vitro methods with our own laboratory team and together with partners. Among other things, they will help us to efficiently and reliably detect and evaluate potential hormonal effects of substances - even without animal testing. BASF has been researching alternative methods for many years and recently reached an important milestone: In 2021,  the  OECD  approved  the  world's  first  toxicology  testing strategy without animal testing - a joint project between BASF and Givaudan (see page 123). It can be used to reliably predict whether a substance causes allergic reactions in the skin without animal testing. We make all methods developed by us and approved freely available to interested companies and authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Many governments' aid programs and rising vaccination rates were key contributing factors to the recovery. Nevertheless, the economic upturn was repeatedly hampered by measures to contain the pandemic and supply chain disruptions.\n\nFor the outlook on the economic environment in 2022, see page 145 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2021 at a glance\n\n+5.8% Global GDP growth\n\n>6%\n\nIncrease in global industrial and chemical production\n\n- /uni25AA Economic recovery in Europe and the United States, slowing momentum  in  Asia\n- /uni25AA Dynamic growth in global industrial production despite fragile supply chains and stagnating automotive industry\n- /uni25AA Strong growth in the global chemical industry\n- /uni25AA Sharp increase in prices for crude oil and naphtha, drastic rise in gas prices\n\nGlobal gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.8% year on year (2020:  -3.4%).  Industrial  production  expanded  by  6.5%  (2020: -3.0%). Global chemical production grew by 6.1% (2020: -0.1%). The average price for a barrel of Brent crude oil increased to $71/uni00A0per barrel (2020: $42 per barrel).\n\n## Trends in the global economy in 2021\n\nThe recovery of the global economy varied from region to region in 2021. There were severe restrictions on public life in the first half of the year, particularly in Europe. In the second and third quarters, many Asian countries struggled with coronavirus outbreaks and took corresponding countermeasures. China maintained its zeroCovid strategy throughout the year and responded to the emergence of any infections with strict containment measures. In the United States, most restrictions were eased after the first quarter despite sharply rising infection numbers over the course of the year. The steady  reopening of economies was facilitated by increasing vaccination rates. Vaccination rates increased significantly during the year in Western Europe and the United States, followed by the advanced Asian countries and China with some delay. Other advanced emerging economies, for example in South America, now also have high vaccination rates. In contrast, vaccination rates are still low in large parts of the poorer countries of Africa and Asia, as well as in Russia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In this section:\n\nEconomic Environment Results of Operations Net Assets Financial Position Actual Development Compared With Outlook for 2021 Business Review by Segment Other Non-Integral Oil and Gas Business Regional Results E.U.

In the second quarter, the United States and the European Union then recorded very high growth rates. Global growth slowed down, however, in the second half of the year. Bottlenecks in global supply chains increasingly limited industry growth. Added to this were the dampening effects of very high energy prices and a further sharp rise in infection rates in individual countries.",

At the beginning of the year, restrictions in stationary retail, hospitality, tourism, and the cultural and entertainment sectors negatively impacted economic recovery. In the course of the second quarter, the restrictions were successively relaxed as a result of falling infection rates. At the same time, the vaccination campaign, which got off to a slow start due to a shortage of vaccines, gained momentum. Due to base effects, GDP growth in the second quarter was in the double digits compared with the previous year. There was, however, also a significant upturn in the second and third quarters of 2021 compared with the first quarter, especially in Euro pean tourist destinations. In France (+7.0%), Italy (+6.4%) and Spain (+5.0%), GDP grew especially dynamically in 2021. By  contrast, Germany was hit harder by bottlenecks in intermediate inputs for the investment  goods  and  automotive  industries.  At  2.8%,  Germany's economy thus grew at a below-average rate in 2021. Despite lower vaccination rates and higher infection rates, growth in the eastern E.U. countries (+5.3%) was at a similar level to that in the western E.U. countries (+5.2%).\n\nDespite the end of the Brexit transition period at the beginning of the year, the United Kingdom's economy (2021: +7.5%) recovered substantially from its major slump in the previous year (2020: -9.4%).\n\nRapidly rising vaccination rates, as well as the complete reopening of the U.K. economy from mid-July, contributed to this. However, the consequences of Brexit were felt over the course of the year, particularly due to the shortage of labor in logistics chains and skilled trades.\n\nRussia's GDP grew by 4.3% (2020: -2.9%). Increased oil and gas prices led to rising trade surpluses and bolstered growth, while high infection rates and lockdowns weighed on the economy.\n\nEconomic development in the United States was volatile. Government stimulus programs bolstered household demand considerably early in the year, which resulted in strong GDP growth in the first two quarters. However, due to the expiration of aid benefits and a further rise in infection rates coupled with increasing supply problems due to congestion in the country's largest ports, growth in private consumption was more sluggish in the second half of the year. In total, GDP in the United States grew by 5.7% in 2021 (2020: -3.4%).\n\nIn the emerging markets of Asia , growth weakened significantly in the course of the year. China's dynamic recovery that began in the previous year continued initially. However, mobility restrictions and selective lockdowns, even with only few occurrences of coronavirus infections, as well as more restrictive financing conditions in the construction sector, negatively affected domestic demand growth. In addition, energy was rationed.  By contrast, export demand grew significantly. In total, the Chinese economy expanded by 8.1% (2020: 2.2%). Many other emerging markets in Asia, including India, Malaysia and Thailand, were forced to temporarily adopt restrictive measures to contain waves of infection. All in all, the region grew by 7.3% in 2021.\n\nThe economies of Japan and South Korea were also significantly impacted by the pandemic. Japan temporarily declared a state of emergency. Private consumption was thus only able to increase slightly. Although exports rose considerably, they were negatively affected by the decline in growth in China and supply bottlenecks in\n\n- 1 In this chapter, 'E.U.' refers to the E.U./uni00A027.\n- 2 We define the emerging markets of Asia as Greater China, the ASEAN countries (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam), India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe automotive  industry. Japan's GDP only grew by 1.7% (2020: -4.5%). South Korea saw significantly higher growth of 4.0% (2020: -0.9%).\n\nThe South America region recorded a rapid economic recovery, supported by rising prices for agricultural goods and industrial raw materials.  Domestic  demand  in  some  countries  was,  however, dampened by currency devaluations and rising inflation rates. Brazil was able to increase its GDP by 4.7% (2020: -4.2%), bolstered by a considerable rise in exports and investments as well as moderate growth in private consumption. Argentina's economic output grew by a strong 9%, though the previous year's decline had been significantly larger at nearly -10%. For the region as a whole, GDP rose by 6.8% in 2021, after a decline of approximately the same magnitude in the previous year.\n\n## Trends in key customer industries\n\nGrowth in industrial production was negatively impacted by supply difficulties in 2021. In many areas, existing orders could not be processed due to a lack of intermediate goods. Transport capacities, especially ship and container capacities in overseas trade, were not sufficient to meet the sharp rise in demand for industrial goods. Furthermore,  manufacturing  disruptions  in  Asia  due  to  regional lockdowns were also a factor.\n\nGlobal industrial production grew by 6.5% in 2021 (2020: -3.0%). The advanced economies saw somewhat lower growth of 5.3% overall than the emerging markets, which saw a rise of 7.4%. The largest contribution to global industrial production growth came from China (2021: +8.4%; 2020: +3.7%). Around 30% of global industrial value creation and almost 40% of its growth were gen erated there. In total, over 50% of global industrial growth came from Asia. The region's production expanded by 7.5% in 2021 (2020: -0.1%).",

South America recorded an increase just above the global average (2021: 7.0%; 2020: -6.5%).\n\n## Growth in key customer industries\n\nReal change compared with previous year\n\n|                               | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Industry total                | 6.5%   | -3.0%  |\n| Transportation                | 2.5%   | -16.6% |\n| Of which: automotive industry | 2.5%   | -15.9% |\n| Energy and resources          | 3.3%   | -3.5%  |\n| Construction                  | 3.9%   | -1.1%  |\n| Consumer goods                | 9.0%   | -2.7%  |\n| Electronics                   | 12.0%  | 3.2%   |\n| Health and nutrition          | 6.4%   | 0.2%   |\n| Agriculture                   | 3.2%   | 2.0%   |\n\nGlobal automotive production was particularly affected by supply problems  with  semiconductors.  Although  base  effects  ensured strong growth at the beginning of the year, the shortage in semiconductors worsened so significantly in the second half of the year that many automotive manufacturers had to respond by cutting production or even temporarily shutting down entire plants. As a result, automotive production grew only slightly overall by 2.5% in 2021 after contracting by 15.9% in the previous year. Production levels remained exceptionally low, with a total of around 76 million vehicles produced worldwide. Similarly low production volumes had last been recorded in the early 2010s. Moderate growth was achieved in Asia (+5.1%). The North American market stagnated (+0.1%). In the E.U., by contrast, production decreased by 6.2% in 2021, following a decline of nearly 25% in 2020. Of all the regions, South America achieved the highest growth rate; however, it saw the strongest decrease in the previous year (2021: +16.1%; 2020: -31.1%).\n\nThe construction industry expanded by around 4% (2020: -1.1%) despite a sharp rise in prices for scarce building materials. Growth was strongest in residential construction at almost 6%. Here, the rising demand for housing during the pandemic played a key role; furthermore,  government  transfers  and  persistently  low  interest rates strengthened the purchasing power of private households. Growth in residential construction was particularly high in the United States. Residential construction in Europe grew only slightly above the overall market average. In China, on the other hand, residential construction cooled significantly in the wake of the government's efforts to limit real estate prices and debt. Commercial construction investments remained weak with growth of less than 3%. Growth in the less volatile infrastructure segment was also below average at around 3%.\n\nAfter a decline of 2.7% in the previous year, consumer goods production grew by a total of 9.0%. High growth rates between around 9% and 13% were recorded in the furniture and textile industries as well as in the production of electrical appliances. Expansion in the care products sector was, by contrast, more modest at 4.3%. This industry had not contracted in the previous year and was therefore less able to benefit from base effects.\n\nThe electronics sector saw above-average growth of 12%. It bene   fited from the general trend toward digitalization and con nectivity, as well as from demand for consumer electronics and electronic control of household appliances and motor vehicles. Growth was slowed by capacity bottlenecks in the production of computer chips.\n\nGlobal demand for energy and industrial raw materials rose sharply in 2021. Production in the energy and raw materials sector, however, only increased by 3.3% (2020: -3.5%), which resulted in signifi cant price increases. The health and nutrition sector achieved growth of 6.4%, which was above average for recent years due to 15% growth in the pharmaceuticals industry resulting from vaccine production. Production in the food industry grew by 3.7%, which, by contrast, was just slightly better than the long-term average.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlso above average, agricultural production grew by 3.2%, as the overall negative impact of extreme weather events on yields was minor relative to recent years and global demand for agricultural goods increased dynamically due to economic recovery. Growth was driven primarily by Asia (+5.3%). By contrast, production growth was only weak in South America (+1.2%) and even declined slightly in North America and Europe.\n\n## Trends in the chemical industry\n\nGlobal growth in the chemical industry was 6.1% in 2021, almost as high as growth for the industry as a whole, despite only a minimal decline in chemical production in the previous year unlike in many other industries. While the stronger performance in the previous year had mainly been due to extraordinary pandemic-related demand for disinfectants, cleaning agents and single-use plastics, as well as to the early recovery in China, in 2021, the global upswing in many consumer goods industries contributed to growth.\n\nChemical production in China, the world's largest chemical market, saw especially strong expansion (+7.7%). However, growth slowed at a high level during the course of the year. Electricity cuts had a negative effect on production, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. Growth in other emerging markets of Asia was also high at around 6.9%.\n\nChemical  production  growth  in  the  European  Union  was  also extraor dinarily high at 6.0%. A contributing factor was the low basis in the previous year (2020: -2.1%). In addition, the European chemical industry benefited from the fact that availability of global production capacities for basic chemicals was intermittently limited. The Middle East (+6.2%) also recorded solid production growth.\n\nBy contrast, significant petrochemical capacities were temporarily unavailable in the United States, in particular. After the cold spell in the first quarter, production on the U.S. Gulf Coast was negatively impacted by hurricanes Ida and Nicholas as well. In total, production",

Global oil demand increased significantly again, but supply was only augmented modestly by OPEC+. As a result, the average price for reference Brent crude oil increased to $71/uni00A0per barrel (2020: $42 per barrel). The price of oil fluctuated over the course of the year between around $55/uni00A0per barrel in January and around $84/uni00A0per barrel in October.\n\nOver the course of the year, the average monthly price for the chemi cal raw material naphtha ranged between $501 per metric ton in January and $764 per metric ton in October. At $635 per metric ton, the annualized average price of naphtha in 2021 was significantly higher than in 2020 ($355 per metric ton).\n\nHigh demand from Asia, cold weather and low storage levels in Western Europe, as well as a limited supply of liquid natural gas led to sharp increases in gas prices. At $16.02/uni00A0 per mmBtu, the average price of gas on the European spot market in particular was significantly higher than in 2020 ($3.17 per mmBtu). It rose from an average price of $6.56/uni00A0per mmBtu in the first quarter to $31.92/uni00A0per mmBtu in the fourth quarter. The average price of gas in the United States was $3.89/uni00A0 per mmBtu, likewise well above the prior-year\n\n## Price trends for crude oil (Brent) and naphtha\n\n$/barrel, $/metric ton\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlevel ($1.99/uni00A0 per mmBtu). Gas prices in China averaged around $6.72/uni00A0 per mmBtu nationally (2020: $6.29/uni00A0per mmBtu), while the average price in the coastal provinces was $7.99/uni00A0 per mmBtu (2020: $7.48/uni00A0per mmBtu).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Many governments' aid programs and rising vaccination rates were key contributing factors to this. In this market environment, growth  in  global  industrial  production  and  in  the  global chemical  industry  (excluding  pharmaceuticals)  was  also significantly above the prior-year level and the long-term average.

This was mainly driven by higher prices and volumes in all segments. Price levels increased in the Chemicals, Surface Technologies and Materials segments in particular. Sales volumes grew primarily in the Surface Technologies and Materials segments. Currency effects, mainly relating to the U.S. dollar, had an offsetting effect. Sales performance was also weighed down by negative portfolio effects, especially in the Industrial Solutions segment following the divestiture of the global pigments business.

Earnings development in the Chemicals segment was primarily driven by higher margins,  higher  sales  volumes  and  an  improvement  in  equityaccounted income. Earnings growth in the Materials segment was mainly attributable to higher margins in isocyanates and polyamides, as well as positive volume development. EBIT before special items also improved considerably in the Surface Technologies and Industrial Solutions segments, largely as a result of higher volumes. By contrast, the Nutrition/uni00A0& Care and Agricultural Solutions segments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecorded considerably lower EBIT before special items. The decline in earnings in the Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segment was mainly attributable to lower margins on the back of higher raw materials and energy prices, as well as an increase in fixed costs. EBIT before special items was lower in the Agricultural Solutions segment, largely due to higher fixed costs, higher raw materials prices and logistics costs, and a low-margin product mix. The segment's earnings were additionally weighed down by negative currency effects.\n\n- For an explanation of the indicator EBIT before special items, see page 43\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| EBIT before special items a, b, c Million \u20ac   |       |       |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| 2021                                          | 7,768 | 7,768 |\n| 2019                                          | 3,560 | 3,560 |\n|                                               | 4,643 | 4,643 |\n| 2018                                          |       | 6,281 |\n| 2017                                          |       |       |\n\n- a EBIT for 2019 has been restated to reflect the reclassification of income from non-integral companies accounted for using the equity method to net income from shareholdings.

The increase in ROCE was primarily due to considerably higher EBIT. 1\n\n- For more information on the calculation of ROCE, see page 42\n\nThe calculation of EBIT as part of our statement of income is shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 194\n\n## ROCE\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| EBIT of BASF Group                                                | 7,677  | -191   |\n| - EBIT of Other                                                   | -641   | -1,203 |\n| EBIT of the segments                                              | 8,317  | 1,012  |\n| Cost of capital basis of segments,   average of month-end figures | 61,579 | 60,111 |\n| ROCE                                                              | 13.5   | 1.7    |\n\n## Capital employed\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                                     | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Intangible assets                                                                   | 13,143 | 14,249 |\n| + Property, plant and equipment                                                     | 19,280 | 20,210 |\n| +  Integral investments accounted for using the   equity method                     | 1,682  | 1,395  |\n| + Inventories                                                                       | 11,459 | 10,469 |\n| + Accounts receivable, trade                                                        | 11,588 | 9,379  |\n| +  Current and noncurrent other receivables   and other assets a                    | 3,908  | 3,149  |\n| + Assets of disposal groups                                                         | 520    | 1,260  |\n| Cost of capital basis of segments,   average of month-end figures                   | 61,579 | 60,111 |\n| +  Deviation from cost of capital basis at   closing rates as of December/uni00A031 | 2,688  | -3,948 |\n| + Assets not included in cost of capital                                            | 23,115 | 24,129 |\n| Assets of the BASF Group as of December/uni00A031                                   | 87,383 | 80,292 |\n\n- a Including customer/supplier financing and other adjustments\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Net income from shareholdings, financial result and income after taxes\n\nNet income from shareholdings was above the prior-year figure, rising by \u20ac1,116/uni00A0million to \u20ac207/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: -\u20ac909/uni00A0million). The increase was mainly due to special income from the sale of our shares in Solenis (\u20ac589/uni00A0 million) as well as the improved earnings contribution from Wintershall Dea/uni00A0AG (-\u20ac344/uni00A0million). This included impairments in the amount of \u20ac581/uni00A0 million, less than in the prior year.\n\nThe financial result amounted to -\u20ac436/uni00A0 million, compared with -\u20ac462/uni00A0 million in the previous year. The interest result improved by \u20ac59/uni00A0million overall, due in part to lower interest expenses for financial indebtedness. The other financial result amounted to -\u20ac122/uni00A0million after -\u20ac89/uni00A0million in 2020, primarily driven by higher net expenses in connection with bonds in foreign currency and the corresponding hedging instruments. Lower write-downs on securities and loans, as well as a lower net interest expense from pension plans and similar obligations had an offsetting effect.\n\nIncome before income taxes amounted to \u20ac7,448/uni00A0million in 2021, after -\u20ac1,562/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\nIncome tax expenses were \u20ac1,430/uni00A0million, after the negative pre-tax result had led to tax income of \u20ac91/uni00A0million in the previous year.\n\nCompared with 2020, income after taxes from continuing operations rose by \u20ac7,489/uni00A0million to \u20ac6,018/uni00A0million. Income after taxes from discontinued operations amounting to -\u20ac36/uni00A0million resulted from purchase price adjustments for the divestiture of the construction  chemicals  business.  The  prior-year  figure  of  \u20ac396/uni00A0 million included the book gain from the sale of the former Construction Chemicals  division  and  its  operating  income  after  taxes  until divestiture.\n\nIncome  after  taxes in  the  amount  of  \u20ac5,982/uni00A0 million  (2020: -\u20ac1,075/uni00A0million) included \u20ac5,523/uni00A0million attributable to shareholders of  BASF/uni00A0 SE  (2020:  -\u20ac1,060/uni00A0 million). Noncontrolling  interests amounted to \u20ac459/uni00A0million, after -\u20ac15/uni00A0million in the prior year. This mainly resulted from a higher earnings contribution from BASF TotalEnergies Petrochemicals LLC in Port Arthur, Texas, and a positive earn ings contribution from BASF Petronas Chemicals Sdn. Bhd. Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, where earnings in the prior year had been impacted by impairments.\n\nIn 2021, earnings per share amounted to \u20ac6.01, compared with -\u20ac1.15 in the previous year.\n\n- For more information on the items in the statement of income, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 200 onward For more information on the tax rate, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 231 onward\n\n## Additional indicators for results of operations\n\nWe also use alternative performance measures (APMs) to steer the BASF/uni00A0 Group. Investors, analysts and rating agencies use them to assess our performance. These are not defined by IFRS. As such, the methods of calculation can differ from those used by other companies. Alternative performance measures for the results of operations are EBIT before special items, EBITDA before special items, EBITDA, the EBITDA margin and adjusted earnings per  share. Other APMs are net debt, 1 free cash flow 1 and capital expenditure (capex). 2\n\nIncome from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items) and income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are indicators that describe operational performance independent of age-related depreciation and amortization of assets and any impairment or reversal of impairment. Both figures are therefore  particularly useful in cross-company comparisons. EBITDA before special items\n\n- 1 For more information on these indicators, see the Financial Position from page 63 onward\n- 2 For more information on capex, see Our Steering Concept on page/uni00A043 and Material Investments and Portfolio Measures on page/uni00A038\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nis also highly useful in making comparisons over time. The EBITDA margin is a relative indicator and is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA to sales revenue, enabling operational performance to be compared independent of the size of the underlying business.\n\nEBITDA before special items rose by \u20ac3,913/uni00A0million year on year to \u20ac11,348/uni00A0million in 2021. At \u20ac11,355/uni00A0million, EBITDA was \u20ac4,861/uni00A0million above the prior-year figure. The EBITDA margin was 14.4% in 2021, compared with 11.0% in the previous year.\n\n## EBITDA before special items\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                                                                                                     | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| EBIT                                                                                                                                                | 7,677  | -191   |\n| - Special items                                                                                                                                     | -91    | -3,751 |\n| EBIT before special items                                                                                                                           | 7,768  | 3,560  |\n| + Depreciation and amortization                                                                                                                     | 3,534  | 3,805  |\n| +  Impairments and reversals of impairments   on property, plant and equipment and intangible   assets before special items                         | 45     | 70     |\n| Depreciation, amortization, impairments and  reversals of impairments on property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets before special  items | 3,580  | 3,875  |\n| EBITDA before special items                                                                                                                         | 11,348 | 7,435  |",

Amortization,  impairment  and reversal of impairment on intangible assets are then eliminated. Amortization of intangible assets primarily results from the purchase price allocation following acquisitions and is therefore of a temporary nature. The effects of these adjustments on income taxes and on noncontrolling interests are also considered. This makes adjusted earnings per share a suitable measure for making comparisons over time and predicting future profitability.\n\nIn 2021, adjusted earnings per share amounted to \u20ac6.76, compared with \u20ac3.21 in the previous year.\n\n- For more information on the earnings per share according to IFRS, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 220\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was mainly attributable to the \u20ac1,906 million increase in property, plant and equipment. Additions to property, plant and equipment amounted to \u20ac4,410 million and included \u20ac332 million in connection with the formation of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd. Currency effects of \u20ac798 million also contributed to the increase. Depreciation amounted to \u20ac2,922/uni00A0million. Intangible assets  amounted to \u20ac13,499 million, \u20ac354 million above the prior year-end figure. The increase was due in particular to currency effects in the amount of \u20ac572/uni00A0million. Additions to intangible assets totaled \u20ac470/uni00A0million and included \u20ac392 million from the formation of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials, of which goodwill was \u20ac254 million. Amortization of \u20ac612/uni00A0million had an offsetting effect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the above transactions see page 41 of this Management's Report and Note/uni00A03 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 207 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

This primarily resulted from higher defined benefit assets and derivatives with positive fair values.\n\nIntegral investments accounted for using the equity method rose by \u20ac662/uni00A0 million year on year to \u20ac2,540 million, mainly due to positive after-tax earnings at BASF YPC-Company Ltd., Nanjing, China, and positive currency effects.\n\nThe \u20ac1,031 million decline in the carrying amounts of non-integral shareholdings accounted for using the equity method compared with December 31, 2020, was largely attributable to dividend payments by and negative after-tax earnings at Wintershall Dea AG and to the disposal of the shareholding in Solenis.\n\nOther financial assets decreased by \u20ac7 million compared with the prior year-end figure.\n\nDeferred tax assets declined by \u20ac786 million, primarily as a result of lower pension provisions.\n\nCurrent assets rose by \u20ac5,183 million to \u20ac35,051 million. This was driven by the \u20ac3,858 million increase in inventories compared with the prior year-end as a result of higher raw materials prices and the stronger business performance in 2021. The \u20ac2,476 million increase in trade accounts receivable was also mainly due to strong business development.\n\nOther receivables and miscellaneous assets rose by \u20ac895 million, primarily due to higher tax refund claims and positive fair values of derivatives.\n\nThe \u20ac1,706 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared with the figure as of December 31, 2020, to \u20ac2,624/uni00A0million had an offsetting effect.\n\nAssets of disposal groups amounted to \u20ac840 million as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021. These include the assets of the shareholding in the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm and the kaolin minerals business, which is held for sale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the composition and development of individual asset items, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 200 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

Retained earnings rose by \u20ac2,454/uni00A0 million, mainly because net income significantly exceeded the dividend payments of \u20ac3,031/uni00A0 million disbursed in the second quarter of 2021. Other comprehensive income increased equity by \u20ac4,619/uni00A0million, primarily as a result of actuarial gains and currency effects.\n\nThe equity ratio improved from 42.8% to 48.2%.\n\nCompared with the 2020 year-end, noncurrent liabilities declined by \u20ac4,394/uni00A0million to \u20ac25,220/uni00A0million. This was primarily attributable to the \u20ac2,406/uni00A0million decrease in provisions for pensions and similar obligations, mainly as a result of higher interest rates in all relevant currency zones and returns on plan assets.\n\nFurthermore, noncurrent financial indebtedness  declined  by \u20ac2,055/uni00A0million. This was primarily due to the reclassification of three bonds with an aggregate carrying amount of \u20ac1,936/uni00A0million and a loan in the amount of \u20ac240/uni00A0million to current financial indebtedness. Exchange rates and interest had an offsetting effect.\n\nTax provisions declined by \u20ac172/uni00A0million year on year to \u20ac415/uni00A0million. By contrast, deferred tax liabilities were slightly above the prior yearend figure, at \u20ac1,499/uni00A0million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The  \u20ac111/uni00A0 million  decrease  in  other  noncurrent  liabilities  largely resulted from lower negative fair values of derivatives.\n\nOther provisions rose by \u20ac298/uni00A0million, mainly due to higher environmental provisions.\n\nAt \u20ac20,081/uni00A0million, current liabilities were \u20ac3,801/uni00A0million above the figure as of December/uni00A0 31, 2020. This was primarily due to the \u20ac2,535/uni00A0million increase in trade accounts payable, largely as a result of positive business development. In addition, current provisions rose by \u20ac1,110/uni00A0 million compared with the previous year, primarily from higher provisions for bonus payments and for rebates. Other liabilities increased by \u20ac239/uni00A0million.\n\nCurrent financial indebtedness was on a level with the prior yearend. This was attributable to the above-mentioned reclassification of three bonds and a loan in the aggregate amount of around \u20ac2.2/uni00A0billion from noncurrent to current financial indebtedness. The reduction in commercial paper at BASF/uni00A0SE (around \u20ac1/uni00A0billion) and the scheduled repayment of a eurobond (\u20ac1/uni00A0billion) and a loan (\u20ac150/uni00A0million) had an offsetting effect.\n\nTax liabilities rose by \u20ac173/uni00A0million compared with the previous year.\n\nLiabilities of disposal groups amounted to \u20ac61/uni00A0million.\n\nNet debt declined by \u20ac325/uni00A0 million compared with December/uni00A0 31, 2020, to \u20ac14,352/uni00A0million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the composition and development of individual asset items, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 200 onward\n\nFor more information on the development of the balance sheet, see the Ten-Year Summary on page 288\n\n## Net debt\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                   | December/uni00A031,  2021   | December/uni00A031,  2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Noncurrent financial indebtedness | 13,764                      | 15,819                      |\n| + Current financial indebtedness  | 3,420                       | 3,395                       |\n| Financial indebtedness            | 17,184                      | 19,214                      |\n| - Marketable securities           | 208                         | 207                         |\n| - Cash and cash equivalents       | 2,624                       | 4,330                       |\n| Net debt                          | 14,352                      | 14,677                      |\n\n## Off-balance sheet obligations\n\nOff-balance sheet obligations mainly relate to long-term purchase obligations for raw materials. We also concluded long-term supply agreements for green power in 2021. In addition, obligations exist in connection with initiated or planned investment projects.\n\n- For more information, see Note/uni00A025 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page/uni00A0263 and the forecast from page 145 onward\n\n## Financing policy and credit ratings\n\nOur financing policy aims to ensure our solvency at all times, limiting the risks associated with financing and optimizing our cost of capital. We preferably meet our external financing needs on the international capital markets.\n\nWe strive to maintain a solid A rating, which ensures unrestricted access to financial and capital markets. Our financing measures are aligned with our operational business planning as well as the company's strategic direction and also ensure the financial flexibility to take advantage of strategic options.\n\n## Maturities of financial indebtedness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Million \u20ac       |       |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| 2022            | 3,420 |\n| 2023            | 2,208 |\n| 2024            | 1,280 |\n| 2025            | 1,892 |\n| 2026            | 1,177 |\n| 2027 and beyond |       |\n\nBASF enjoys good credit ratings, especially compared with competitors in the chemical industry. Standard/uni00A0& Poor's most recently confirmed its rating for BASF of A/A-1/outlook stable on January/uni00A06, 2022. Moody's most recently confirmed BASF's A3/P-2/outlook stable rating on January/uni00A0 5, 2022. Fitch's rating of A/F1/outlook stable from June/uni00A011, 2021, also remained unchanged.\n\nWe have solid financing. Corporate bonds form the basis of our medium to long-term debt financing. These are issued in euros and other currencies with different maturities as part of our \u20ac20/uni00A0billion debt issuance program. The goal is to create a balanced maturity profile, diversify our financing and optimize our debt capital financing conditions.\n\nFor short-term financing, we use BASF/uni00A0 SE's global commercial paper program, which has an issuing volume of up to $12.5/uni00A0billion. As of December/uni00A031, 2021, commercial paper with a carrying amount of \u20ac248/uni00A0million was outstanding under this program. A firmly committed, syndicated credit line of \u20ac6/uni00A0 billion with a term until 2026 covers the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. It can also be used for general company purposes. The credit line, as well as a short-term credit line of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion that expired in the second quarter of 2021, were not used at any point in 2021. Our external financing is therefore largely independent of short-term fluctuations in the credit markets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Foreign currency risks are primarily hedged centrally using derivative financial instruments in the market.\n\nOur interest risk management generally pursues the goal of reducing interest expenses for the BASF/uni00A0 Group and limiting interest risks. Interest rate hedging transactions are therefore conducted with banks in order to turn selected liabilities to the capital market from fixed to variable interest rates or vice versa.\n\n- For more information on the financing tools and hedging instruments used, see Note/uni00A021 from page/uni00A0251 onward and Note/uni00A026 from page/uni00A0263 onward in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nCash flows from operating activities amounted to \u20ac7,245/uni00A0million, compared with \u20ac5,413/uni00A0million in the previous year. The considerable increase was primarily due to the improvement in net income, which had included high impairments in the previous year. Accordingly, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets was significantly below the prior-year figure in 2021, at \u20ac3,687/uni00A0million. An offsetting factor was cash tied up in net working capital, which rose by \u20ac1,166/uni00A0million to \u20ac1,566/uni00A0million in 2021. This mainly resulted from the significant increase in inventories by \u20ac3,304/uni00A0million due to higher business volumes and prices after a reduction in inventories had supported operating cash flows in the previous year.\n\nCash of \u20ac1,272/uni00A0million was tied up in receivables, \u20ac904/uni00A0million less than in the prior year. The improvement was due in particular to the reduction  in  precious  metal  trading  exposures.  Trade  accounts receivable rose by \u20ac1,799/uni00A0 million, \u20ac805/uni00A0 million more than in the previous  year.  By  contrast,  the  \u20ac3,010/uni00A0 million  rise  in  liabilities increased operating cash flows. This was largely attributable to the increase in trade accounts payable and current provisions. This effect was less pronounced in the previous year at \u20ac927/uni00A0million.\n\nMiscellaneous items led to cash tied up of \u20ac398/uni00A0million in 2021, after cash released of \u20ac122/uni00A0million in the previous year. This was due in particular to the elimination of equity-accounted income and the reclassification of income from divestitures, including the gain on the disposal of the shareholding in Solenis, to cash flows from investing activities.\n\nCash flows from investing activities totaled -\u20ac2,622/uni00A0 million in 2021, after -\u20ac1,904/uni00A0million in the previous year. Payments received for divestitures and the disposal of the shareholding in Solenis in 2021 were below the figure from the disposal of the construction chemicals business in the previous year. By contrast, payments made for acquisitions amounted to \u20ac600/uni00A0million in 2021, around half the prior-year figure. The \u20ac403/uni00A0million increase in payments made\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfor property, plant and equipment and intangible assets also contributed to the decrease in cash flows from investing activities.\n\nCash flows from financing activities amounted to -\u20ac6,457/uni00A0million. In addition to the payment of dividends in the amount of \u20ac3,312/uni00A0million  (2020:  \u20ac3,139/uni00A0 million),  financial  and  similar  liabilities  were reduced by \u20ac3,145/uni00A0million.\n\nFree cash flow , which remains after deducting payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from cash flows from operating activities, represents the financial resources remaining after investments. It amounted to \u20ac3,713/uni00A0million in 2021, after \u20ac2,284/uni00A0million in the previous year.",

        "page_content": "## Actual Development Compared With Outlook for 2021\n\n## Sales, earnings and ROCE forecast for the BASF Group\n\nWe increased sales to \u20ac78.6/uni00A0billion in 2021, considerably above our forecast at the beginning of the year of sales growth to between \u20ac61/uni00A0 billion  and  \u20ac64/uni00A0 billion.  Sales  in  the  Surface  Technologies, Chemi cals, Industrial Solutions, Agricultural Solutions and Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segments rose more strongly than initially expected. This was driven primarily by significantly higher prices, especially in the Surface Technologies and Chemicals segments. We increased sales volumes as expected. Currency and portfolio effects had an offsetting impact, in line with our assumptions.\n\nAt \u20ac7.8/uni00A0 billion, EBIT before special items likewise significantly exceeded the forecast range of between \u20ac4.1/uni00A0billion and \u20ac5.0/uni00A0billion. The Industrial Solutions, Nutrition/uni00A0& Care and Agricultural Solutions segments in particular did not develop as expected. Industrial Solutions increased EBIT before special items considerably, contrary to the forecast of a slight decline. EBIT before special items in the Agricultural Solutions and Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segments declined considerably; in both segments, we had expected a slight improvement in earnings.\n\nWe considerably increased ROCE in almost all segments. ROCE increased only slightly in the Agricultural Solutions segment, while the Nutrition & Care segment saw a considerable decline. Overall, the degree of improvement exceeded our expectations: ROCE for the BASF/uni00A0Group amounted to 13.5%, considerably above the range we had forecast of between 8.0% and 9.2%.\n\nWe revised the outlook provided in February/uni00A02021 in April, July and October 2021. In October 2021, we projected sales of between \u20ac76/uni00A0billion and \u20ac78/uni00A0billion. We expected EBIT before special items of \u20ac7.5/uni00A0 billion to \u20ac8.0/uni00A0 billion. For ROCE, we forecast a range of 13.2% to 14.1%.\n\n## Forecast/actual comparison\n\n|                        | Sales                                     | Sales                | EBIT before special items            | EBIT before special items   | ROCE          | ROCE        |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n|                        | 2021 forecast                             | 2021 actual          | 2021 forecast                        | 2021 actual                 | 2021 forecast | 2021 actual |\n| Chemicals              |                                           |                      |                                      |                             |               |             |\n| Materials              |                                           |                      |                                      |                             |               |             |\n| Industrial Solutions   |                                           |                      |                                      |                             |               |             |\n| Surface Technologies   |                                           |                      |                                      |                             |               |             |\n| Nutrition & Care       |                                           |                      |                                      |                             |               |             |\n| Agricultural Solutions |                                           |                      |                                      |                             |               |             |\n| Other                  |                                           |                      |                                      |                             | -             | -           |\n| BASF Group             | \u20ac61/uni00A0billion-  \u20ac64/uni00A0billion a | \u20ac78.6/uni00A0billion | \u20ac4.1 billion-  \u20ac5.0/uni00A0billion a | \u20ac7.8/uni00A0billion         | 8.0%-9.2% a   | 13.5%       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- At prior-year level: no change (+/-0.0%)\n- | Slight increase/decrease: 'slight' represents a change of 0.1%-5.0% for sales; 0.1%-10.0% for earnings; 0.1 to 1.0 percentage points for ROCE\n- | Considerable increase/decrease: 'considerable' represents a change of 5.1% or higher for sales; 10.1% or higher for earnings; more than 1.0 percentage points for ROCE\n- a We updated our outlook in April, July and October 2021. We most recently updated it in October 2021,  f orecasting sales of between \u20ac76/uni00A0billion and \u20ac78/uni00A0billion, EBIT before special items of between \u20ac7.5/uni00A0billion and \u20ac8.0/uni00A0billion, and a ROCE of between 13.2% and 14.1%.\n\n## Accelerator sales and CO2 emissions forecast for the BASF/uni00A0Group\n\nWe increased Accelerator sales to \u20ac24.1/uni00A0billion in 2021, considerably above the range forecast in February of between \u20ac18/uni00A0billion and \u20ac19/uni00A0billion. The range forecast in October - between \u20ac21.5/uni00A0billion and \u20ac22.5/uni00A0 billion - was likewise exceeded. This was due to the BASF/uni00A0 Group's extremely positive business performance, which was also reflected in Accelerator sales. The decline caused by the divestiture of the global pigments business and the resulting outflow of Accelerator products only had a slight offsetting effect overall.\n\nCO2 emissions amounted to 20.2/uni00A0million metric tons, slightly below the range we forecast in February of between 20.5/uni00A0million metric tons and 21.5/uni00A0million metric tons. BASF significantly increased production volumes in 2021 in response to stronger demand. To reduce the additional emissions resulting from this, we made procuring energy from renewable sources a focus. To this end, BASF  converted energy supply agreements, acquired renewable energy certificates and signed long-term supply agreements for green power. A project to reduce nitrous oxide emissions in Ludwigshafen, Germany, was successfully implemented. Divestitures such as the disposal of the global pigments business led to a slight decline in emissions. In addition, emissions were significantly reduced by the lower capacity utilization of the ammonia plant due to the sharp rise in natural gas prices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Capex forecast for the BASF/uni00A0Group\n\nIn 2021, we invested a total of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion in capital expenditures (capex), excluding additions from acquisitions, IT investments, restoration obligations and right-of-use assets arising from leases. The figure forecast in February 2021 was \u20ac3.6/uni00A0billion.\n\n## Sales, earnings and ROCE forecast for the segments\n\nWe considerably increased sales in the Chemicals segment in 2021, after only forecasting a slight increase in sales at the beginning of the year. Both divisions raised prices, significantly exceeding the price increases assumed in February as a result of extraordinary supply  bottlenecks  in  the  markets.  We  increased  volumes  as expected. The segment considerably increased EBIT before special items and ROCE, in line with the forecast.\n\nThe Materials segment recorded a considerable improvement in sales, EBIT before special items and ROCE as forecast.\n\nSales in the Industrial Solutions segment rose considerably in 2021, exceeding our expectations of a slight decline. This was largely driven by volume growth. Against our assumptions, this more than compensated for the negative effects from the divestiture of the global pigments business. The segment's volume growth also led to considerably higher EBIT before special items, contrary to our forecast of a slight decline. ROCE was significantly above the prior- year level, as expected.\n\nThe Surface  Technologies segment  achieved  significant  sales growth, exceeding our forecast from February, in which we had assumed only a slight  increase in sales. This primarily resulted from higher  precious  metal  prices,  which  rose  more  strongly  than expected. The significant recovery in EBIT before special items and ROCE materialized as expected.\n\nSales in the Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segment were considerably above the prior-year figure, exceeding our forecast of slight growth. This was mainly due to higher price levels, after we had assumed lower prices in February. We increased volumes in both divisions as expected. EBIT before special items declined significantly in 2021, falling short of our expectations of a slight increase. The decrease was attributable to lower earnings contributions from both divisions. This was mainly due to lower margins as a result of higher raw materials and energy prices as well as higher fixed costs, primarily from higher bonus provisions. ROCE also declined considerably in line with earnings development in the segment. Our forecast had assumed a considerable increase.\n\nSales in the Agricultural Solutions segment rose considerably, not just slightly as forecast. Higher sales volumes and prices exceeded negative currency effects to a greater extent than we had  anticipated. Contrary to our forecast of a slight increase, EBIT before special items was considerably below the prior-year level. The positive sales development was unable to compensate for an increase in fixed costs, mainly from higher bonus provisions, higher raw materials prices and logistics costs, and a low-margin product mix. Based on the development of earnings, we were only able to increase ROCE slightly, against our assumption of a considerable increase.\n\nWe significantly improved sales and EBIT before special items in Other as forecast.\n\nFor more information on our forecast for 2022, see page 148 onward\n\nFor more information on investments, see page 38 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

Both divisions contributed to the increase with considerable sales growth. The Petrochemicals division increased sales by \u20ac4,248/uni00A0 million to \u20ac9,674/uni00A0 million, while sales in the Intermediates division rose by \u20ac1,259/uni00A0million to \u20ac3,904/uni00A0million.\n\n## Factors influencing sales - Chemicals\n\n|            | Chemicals   | Petrochemicals   | Intermediates   |\n|------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Volumes    | 9.6%        | 10.5%            | 7.9%            |\n| Prices     | 61.2%       | 71.5%            | 40.2%           |\n| Portfolio  | -0.7%       | -1.0%            | 0.0%            |\n| Currencies | -1.9%       | -2.6%            | -0.4%           |\n| Sales      | 68.2%       | 78.3%            | 47.6%           |\n\nSales performance was mainly driven by significantly higher price levels. This was largely due to strong demand alongside low product availability, mainly caused by extreme weather conditions such as Winter Storm Uri in North America, supply chain disruptions, as well as significantly higher feedstock and energy costs. As a result, the Petrochemicals division increased prices in all business areas, especially for steam cracker products, styrene monomers and along the entire propylene value chain. The Intermediates division raised prices in the butanediol and derivatives business in particular, as well as in the acids and polyalcohols business.\n\nSales growth was supported by a significant increase in volumes due to strong demand. Volumes in the Petrochemicals division grew mainly in steam cracker products and styrene monomers.

The Monomers division achieved higher prices primarily in isocyanates and polyamides, while the Performance Materials division raised price levels mainly in polyurethane systems and engineering plastics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Segment data - Materials Million \u20ac\n\n|                                                                            | 2021   | 2020   | +/-    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sales to third parties                                                     | 15,214 | 10,736 | 41.7%  |\n| of which Performance Materials                                             | 7,292  | 5,635  | 29.4%  |\n| Monomers                                                                   | 7,922  | 5,101  | 55.3%  |\n| Intersegment transfers                                                     | 1,250  | 720    | 73.6%  |\n| Sales including transfers                                                  | 16,464 | 11,456 | 43.7%  |\n| Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items | 3,208  | 1,714  | 87.2%  |\n| Income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)       | 3,162  | 1,556  | 103.2% |\n| EBITDA margin                                                              | 20.8   | 14.5   | -      |\n| Depreciation and amortization a                                            | 817    | 1,665  | -50.9% |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)                                              | 2,345  | -109   | .      |\n| Special items                                                              | -73    | -944   | 92.3%  |\n| EBIT before special items                                                  | 2,418  | 835    | 189.6% |\n| Return on capital employed (ROCE)                                          | 22.8   | -1.1   | -      |\n| Assets                                                                     | 11,286 | 9,118  | 23.8%  |\n| Investments including acquisitions b                                       | 709    | 1,957  | -63.8% |\n| Research and development expenses                                          | 193    | 182    | 6.1%   |\n\n- a Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including impairments and reversals of impairments)\n- b Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nVolumes rose significantly as a result of strong demand and contributed to sales growth. The Performance Materials division recorded higher sales volumes in the transportation and consumer goods industries, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe. In the second half of 2021, volume development was however negatively impacted by the semiconductor shortage in the automotive market and the resulting production outages. Overall, sales volumes in the construction industry were slightly above the prior-year level. Higher volumes in Europe more than compensated for lower volumes in North America. The Monomers division increased volumes, especially of polyamide 6.6 following the slight recovery in automotive production in 2021 after the weak prior year due to the pandemic. Sales  volumes  of  methylene  diphenyl  diisocyanate  (MDI)  were also higher.\n\nPortfolio effects from the acquisition of the integrated polyamide business from Solvay, which closed as of January/uni00A031, 2020, had a slightly positive impact on sales.\n\nCurrency effects, primarily relating to the U.S. dollar, had a slightly negative impact on sales development in both divisions.",

The decline in earnings in the Nutrition/uni00A0& Health division resulted from lower margins, driven by higher prices for raw materials and energy, the lower availability of vitamin/uni00A0A, and higher fixed costs, primarily from higher bonus provisions. EBIT before special items in the Care Chemicals division decreased due mainly to higher fixed costs, largely as a result of higher bonus provisions.\n\nEBIT declined by \u20ac134/uni00A0 million year on year to \u20ac554/uni00A0 million. It included special income from the sale of the production site in Kankakee, Illinois, in the second quarter of 2021. In the previous year, EBIT included special charges, mainly for impairments and provisions, primarily for the optimization of production structures in the Nutrition/uni00A0& Health division.\n\nFor the outlook for 2022, see page 148 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Division sales by region\n\n(Location of customer)\n\n| Divisions                 | Europe   | North America   | Asia Pacific   | South America,  Africa, Middle East   | Total  (million/uni00A0\u20ac)   |\n|---------------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Care Chemicals            | 53%      | 18%             | 20%            | 9%                                    | 4,439                       |\n| Nutrition/uni00A0& Health | 37%      | 18%             | 35%            | 10%                                   | 2,003                       |\n\n## Division, products, applications\n\n|                           | Products                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Customer industries and applications                                                                             |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Care Chemicals            | Ingredients for skin and hair cleansing and care products, such as  emollients, cosmetic active ingredients, polymers and UV filters Ingredients for detergents and cleaners in household, institution or  industry, such as surfactants, enzymes, chelating agents, water-  soluble polymers, biocides and products for optical effects Chemical ingredients and processing additives, for example for crop  protection, excipients for chemical processes such as emulsion | Cosmetics, detergent and cleaner industry, agrochemical industry, technical  applications for various industries |\n| Nutrition/uni00A0& Health | Additives for the food and feed industries, such as vitamins,  carotenoids, sterols, enzymes, emulsifiers, omega-3 fatty acids  Industrial enzymes for bioethanol and food production, natural and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Food and feed industries, flavor and fragrance industry, pharmaceutical  industry and bioethanol industry        |\n\n## Production capacities of selected products in the regions a\n\n| Product               | Europe        | North America   | Asia Pacific   | South America,   Africa, Middle East   | Annual capacity   (metric tons)   |\n|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Anionic surfactants   | /uni25A0.alt1 | /uni25A0.alt1   | /uni25A0.alt1  | /uni25A0.alt1                          | 550,000                           |\n| Citral                | /uni25A0.alt1 |                 | /uni25A0.alt1  |                                        | 78,000                            |\n| Chelating agents      | /uni25A0.alt1 | /uni25A0.alt1   |                | /uni25A0.alt1                          | 170,000                           |\n| Methane sulfonic acid | /uni25A0.alt1 |                 |                |                                        | 30,000                            |\n| Nonionic surfactants  | /uni25A0.alt1 | /uni25A0.alt1   | /uni25A0.alt1  |                                        | 650,000                           |\n\n- a All capacities are included at 100%, including plants belonging to joint operations and joint ventures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This reflects the value of the exploration and production businesses contributed by Wintershall and DEA. BASF additionally holds preference shares for the contribution of Wintershall's  gas  transportation  business.  Including  preference  shares, BASF has a shareholding of 72.7% in Wintershall Dea.\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nThe price of a barrel of reference Brent crude oil averaged $71 in 2021 (2020: $42). Gas prices on European spot markets rose sharply and were at an all-time high at the end of 2021. The significant price increases in the second half of 2021 were driven by the very strong recovery in global macroeconomic demand.\n\n## Equity-accounted income of the oil and gas business\n\nWintershall Dea/uni00A0 AG contributed -\u20ac344/uni00A0million to net income from shareholdings in 2021 (2020: -\u20ac890/uni00A0million). This included impairments and reversals of impairments totaling -\u20ac581/uni00A0million, mainly in connection with the planned divestiture of assets in Argentina and due to adjusted price expectations. In the previous year, lower oil and gas price forecasts and changed reserve estimates led to impair ments of \u20ac791/uni00A0million.\n\nWintershall Dea conducts production, development 1 and exploration activities in the following countries:\n\n- - Egypt (production, development, exploration)\n- - Algeria (production)\n- - Argentina (production, development, exploration)\n- - Denmark (production, exploration)\n- 1 Development activities include projects before and after the FID (final investment decision)\n- 2 Scope 1 and 2 emissions from upstream activities operated and non-operated by Wintershall Dea at an equity basis\n- 3 100% volume of methane emissions of Wintershall Dea's operated assets divided by the volume of the own operated gas marketed\n- 4 Carbon capture and storage\n- - Germany (production, development, exploration)\n- - Libya (production)\n- - Mexico (production, development, exploration)\n- - Netherlands (production, development, exploration)\n- - Norway (production, development, exploration)\n- - Russia (production, development)\n- - United Arab Emirates (development)\n- - United Kingdom (production, development, exploration)\n\n## Wintershall Dea's activities in 2021\n\nWintershall Dea produced 231/uni00A0million BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) in 2021 (2020: 227/uni00A0million BOE), of which around 165/uni00A0million BOE of gas (2020: 162/uni00A0million BOE of gas). This corresponded to a daily production of 634/uni00A0thousand BOE (2020: 623/uni00A0thousand BOE).\n\nSeveral development projects were successfully completed in 2021, including the Norwegian projects \u00c6rfugl Phase/uni00A02, Gr\u00e5sel, and the field development of Solveig. The Achim Development joint venture operated by Gazprom in Russia, in which Wintershall Dea holds a 25.01% interest, started production in the first quarter of 2021. In Egypt, production at the Raven field started at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Norwegian Njord and Nova projects continued and are  expected to come on stream in 2022. The start of production for the Dvalin project in Norway was postponed to the second half of 2022. At the beginning of 2022, Wintershall Dea reached an agreement on the sale of its 50% interest in the unconventional oil blocks it operates in Argentina and decided to terminate its operations in Brazil.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWintershall Dea drilled 12/uni00A0 exploration wells in 2021. Of these, around 58% were successful.\n\nWintershall Dea is also active in gas transportation. This includes interests  in  GASCADE  Gastransport  GmbH  and  OPAL  Gas transport GmbH/uni00A0 &/uni00A0 Co./uni00A0 KG held by WIGA Transport BeteiligungsGmbH/uni00A0& Co./uni00A0KG, and the interest in Nord Stream/uni00A0AG held directly by  Winters hall/uni00A0Dea. Wintershall Dea is one of five financial investors for the Nord Stream/uni00A0 2 pipeline project. It is not a  shareholder of Nord/uni00A0 Stream/uni00A0 2/uni00A0 AG. The laying of Nord Stream/uni00A02 was successfully completed,  the  pipelines  have  been  filled  with  gas  and  Nord Stream/uni00A02/uni00A0AG has applied to the relevant authorities for  certification to operate the pipeline.\n\nAs part of its climate strategy, which was communicated in November 2020, Wintershall Dea aims to achieve net zero emissions 2 from upstream activities by 2030 and reduce methane intensity 3 to 0.1% by 2025. Wintershall Dea is involved in the Greensand CCS project 4 in the Danish North Sea, which aims to store up to 8/uni00A0million metric tons of CO2 per year.\n\nAs planned, in 2021 Wintershall Dea completed the integration that began with the merger and was able to realize the intended synergies. The IPO targeted for 2021 was postponed due to the market environment.",

This was primarily due to considerably higher sales in the Chemicals and Materials segments. The Surface Technologies segment, Other and the Industrial Solutions and Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segments also posted considerable sales growth, while the Agricultural Solutions segment saw a slight increase in sales.\n\nSales  growth  was  driven  by  higher  prices  and  volumes  in  all segments and in Other. Prices rose especially for steam cracker products in the Chemicals segment, for isocyanates in the Materials segment, and as a result of higher precious metal prices in the Surface Technologies segment. Sales volumes increased, especially in  the  Materials,  Surface  Technologies,  Industrial  Solutions  and Chemi  cals segments. Volume development was however negatively impacted by raw materials shortages, the semiconductor deficit in the automotive market and the associated production and supply chain disruptions. Sales were reduced by negative currency effects,\n\nmainly in the Surface Technologies segment. Sales performance was also weighed down by portfolio effects, particularly in the Industrial  Solutions segment following the divestiture of the global pigments   business.\n\n## North America\n\nSales at companies located in North America rose by 33.4% to \u20ac21,935 million in 2021. In local currency terms, they were 38.5% above the prior-year figure. Sales growth was mainly driven by considerably higher sales in the Surface Technologies and Chemicals segments. The Materials segment, Other and the Industrial Solutions segment also achieved considerably higher sales. Sales rose slightly in the Agricultural Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments.\n\nSales growth was mainly due to significantly higher price levels, especially in the Surface Technologies segment due to a significant increase in precious metal prices, and in the Chemicals segment, particularly for propylene and butadiene. Higher volumes supported sales performance in all segments. Volume development was however negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions, the semiconductor shortage in the automotive market and the resulting production and supply chain disruptions. Negative currency effects had an offsetting  effect. Sales were reduced by portfolio effects, mainly driven by the divestiture of the global pigments business in the Industrial Solutions segment.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nSales at companies headquartered in the Asia Pacific region were 38.5% above the 2020 figure, at \u20ac20,632 million. In local currency terms, sales likewise rose by 38.5%. The increase in sales was\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprimarily driven by growth in Greater China, where sales rose by 42.5% in euros to \u20ac12,018 million. All segments improved sales in the  region compared with the prior year, but especially the Surface Technologies, Materials and Chemicals segments.\n\nThe sales performance was primarily the result of higher prices, particularly in the Surface Technologies, Chemicals and Materials segments.  Higher  volumes  in  all  segments  contributed  to  the increase in sales. Raw material shortages, the semiconductor deficit in the automotive market and the associated production and supply chain disruptions also hampered sales performance in Asia Pacific. Overall, portfolio measures had a positive impact on sales development, especially in Greater China and in the Surface Technologies segment following the formation of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd.\n\n## South America, Africa, Middle East\n\nSales at companies located in South America, Africa, Middle East rose by 23.5% to \u20ac4,437 million. In local currency terms, they were 31.0% above the prior-year level. Sales growth was primarily attribut able to considerably higher sales in the Agricultural Solutions, Surface Technologies, Chemicals and Materials segments. The Indus trial Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments also recorded higher sales.\n\nThe sales increase was mainly driven by higher prices, especially in the Surface Technologies, Agricultural Solutions and Chemicals segments.  All  segments  significantly  increased  volumes  despite supply chain disruptions caused by raw materials shortages. Negative currency effects had an offsetting impact in all segments.",

Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementary delegated acts, the Nonfinancial Statement includes, for the first time, the share of the Group's taxonomyeligible s ales, investments and operating expenses for the 2021 business year relating to the environmental objectives of 'climate change mitigation' and 'adaptation to climate change.' BASF activities that are not currently  covered by the E.U. taxonomy, and as such, are not relevant from a taxonomy perspective are generally reported as taxonomy-noneligible in accordance with the delegated acts. These include large parts of BASF's activities that may nevertheless be in line with the E.U.'s environmental objectives.\n\nTo determine taxonomy eligibility, we first identified the activities relevant to BASF. The entire portfolio of products manufactured by BASF as well as production plants and investment projects were then reviewed to determine whether they belong to one of the following activities in the manufacturing sector that had been identified as relevant:\n\n- - Manufacture of hydrogen\n- - Manufacture of carbon black\n- - Manufacture of soda ash\n- - Manufacture of chlorine\n- - Manufacture of organic basic chemicals\n- - Manufacture of anhydrous ammonia\n- - Manufacture of nitric acid\n- - Manufacture of plastics in primary form\n\nWe additionally assessed the following enabling activities in the E.U. taxonomy to take into account solutions that contribute to climate change mitigation at our customers: 'manufacture of batteries' and 'manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings.' To avoid double counting, assignment to an enabling activitiy is only made if a  taxonomy-eligible  product  or  project  had  not  already  been included under another activity. BASF also contributes solutions used to produce technologies for renewable energy or low-carbon mobility. Since the E.U. taxonomy focuses on the manufacture of technologies  and  thus  excludes  precursors,  we  have  classified these as taxonomy-non-eligible.\n\nIn addition to our core business, the production of chemical products, we have identified further BASF activities that can be allocated to the following activities presented in the E.U. taxonomy:\n\n- - Afforestation\n- - Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\n- - Production of heat/cool from bioenergy\n- - Production of heat/cool using waste heat\n- - Close to market research, development and innovation\n\nThese activities made no material contribution to our overall taxonomy eligibility and were generally classified as taxonomy-noneligible. 1\n\nBuildings constructed and operated by BASF, traffic facilities and central water supply and wastewater management systems, i.e., the infrastructure that supports our core activities, may also fall under the E.U. taxonomy's description of activities in the areas 'Water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation,' 'Transport,' and 'Construction and real estate activities.' In assessing taxonomy eligibility, we focused in 2021 on activities in the manufacturing sector and closely related activities in the energy and research and development sectors. We generally classified potential contributions  from  infrastructure- related  activities  as  taxonomy-noneligible.\n\nWe assessed the taxonomy eligibility of our sales based on sales revenue  as  defined  and  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements of the BASF/uni00A0 Group. Taxonomy-eligible sales revenue accounted for 11% of total sales revenue in 2021. The largest contributions were from the activities 'manufacture of plastics in primary form' and 'manufacture of organic basic chemicals.' Taxonomyeligible investments (including acquisitions and excluding goodwill in accordance with the E.U. taxonomy) accounted for 29% of the total\n\n- 1 The production of heat/cool using waste heat was also partially covered by other activities.\n- 2 The criteria for the activity 'close to market research, development and innovation' (for example, a technology readiness level of at least six) were used to determine taxonomy-eligible research and development costs.\n\ninvestments  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. Investments in the 'manufacture of organic basic chemicals' and in the  'manufacture  of  batteries'  made  the  greatest  contribution. Operating expenses include non-capitalized costs that relate to research and development, 2 and maintenance and repair. They are not reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements in this form. All of the investments and operating expenses of a production facility with a taxonomy-eligible activity are counted as taxonomyeligible. Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses accounted for 11% of total operating expenses. The largest contributions were from the activities 'manufacture of organic basic chemicals' and 'manufacture of plastics in primary form.'\n\nBASF entered into several partnerships to transform energy supply in 2021 (see page 128). The resulting investments are not included in the analysis of taxonomy eligibility, as investments in joint ventures and associated companies do not have to be reported under the taxonomy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on sales revenue, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 221 onward\n\nFor more information on investments, see Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 236 onward\n\n## Sales, investments and operating expenses in 2021 Million \u20ac\n\n|                    | Total   | Taxonomy-  eligible   |   % | Taxonomy- non- eligible   |   % |\n|--------------------|---------|-----------------------|-----|---------------------------|-----|\n| Sales              | 78,598  | 8,881                 |  11 | 69,717                    |  89 |\n| Investments        | 4,627   | 1,340                 |  29 | 3,287                     |  71 |\n| Operating expenses | 4,424   | 504                   |  11 | 3,920                     |  89 |",

That is why the three pillars of sustainability are firmly anchored in our corporate purpose, our strategy, our targets and our operating business. They are at the core of what we do, a driver for growth and an element of our risk management. We pursue a holistic approach that covers the entire value chain.\n\nWe contribute to a sustainable development and to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in many ways (see page 36). For instance, our innovations, products and technologies help to use natural resources more efficiently, meet the demand for food, enable climate-smart mobility, reduce emissions and  waste,  and  increase  the  capabilities  of  renewable  energy. Alongside these positive contributions, our business activities also have negative impacts. For example, we create CO2 emissions, use water and procure raw materials from suppliers, which may involve a potential risk of human rights violations. This is why we are constantly working to broaden our positive contributions to key sustainability topics (see page 45) along our value chains and reduce the negative impacts.\n\nWe  are  committed  to  doing  business  in  a responsible,  safe, resource-efficient and respectful way. Our actions are guided by our corporate values and our global Code of Conduct. We comply with and in some cases exceed the applicable laws and regulations with voluntary commitments. We stipulate binding rules for our employees with standards and guidelines that apply throughout the Group. In doing so, we consider, respect and promote internationally recognized principles such as the 10 principles of the U.N. Global Compact and the Core Labor Standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO).\n\nWe want to ensure that we act in line with the applicable laws and uphold  our  responsibility  to  the  environment  and  society  with our comprehensive management and monitoring systems . Our Responsible Care Management System does this for environmental\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprotection, health and safety (see page 117). We meet our responsibilities with respect to international labor and social standards chiefly through three elements: the Compliance Program, close dialog with our stakeholders and the guideline on compliance with international labor norms, which applies Group-wide.\n\nOur business partners are also expected to comply with prevailing laws and regulations and to align their actions with internationally recognized principles. We have established appropriate management  and  control  systems,  for  example,  for  working  with  our suppliers (see page 109).\n\nWe seek dialog with our stakeholders to discuss critical issues and, if necessary, develop solutions together. Through our societal engagement, we want to create a positive impact, particularly in the  communities  surrounding  our  sites  and  help  solve  global challenges.\n\nWe are involved in numerous sustainability initiatives to drive forward sustainability in general and, specifically, as this relates to our value chains. These include the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) as well as networks with\n\nthematic focus like the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) or the Global Battery Alliance (GBA). In addition, we realize a wide range of projects - often together with partners - for example, to improve sustainability in the supply chain or to promote circularity in the economy.\n\nFor more information on how we value people and treat them with respect, see page 97 onward\n\nFor more information on responsible procurement, see page 109 onward\n\nFor more information on safe and efficient production, see page 117 onward\n\nFor more information on sustainable solutions, see page 141 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to continue to attract talented people to our company in the future, we work continuously on BASF's attractiveness as an employer. Our employees play an important role here as ambassadors for BASF.\n\n## Number of employees\n\nAs of December/uni00A0 31, 2021, the number of employees increased to 111,047/uni00A0 employees compared with 110,302/uni00A0 employees as of December/uni00A031, 2020. The rise was primarily due to staff increases in  Asia  Pacific,  especially  in  connection  with  the  formation  of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., as well as for our new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China. The divestiture of the pigments business, which affected around 2,500/uni00A0 employees, had an off setting impact. We employed 3,028/uni00A0 apprentices 1 (2020: 3,120). 2,329/uni00A0 employ ees were on temporary contracts (of which 47.6% were women).\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nBASF can rely on the engagement of its employees. This is shown by a passion for the job, a dedication to top performance and a strong commitment to BASF. Global employee surveys and pulse checks are established feedback tools in the BASF/uni00A0Group and are used to actively involve employees in shaping their working environment. The results are communicated to employees, the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board and stakeholders. We have performed regular global employee surveys since 2008. We aim to keep the high level of employee engagement determined by these  surveys and increase it even further as far as possible. As part of the BASF strategy, we therefore set ourselves the following goal in 2018: More than 80% of our employees feel that at BASF, they\n\ncan thrive and perform at their best. We regularly calculate the employee engagement level as an index score based on five questions on set topics in our employee surveys. The most recent survey from 2020 revealed an engagement index of 82% (2019: 79%). Our aim is to keep this score above 80%. We support our leaders with a range of follow-up measures to decentrally address individual action areas and in this way, help to further strengthen employee engagement together with their employees.\n\nPulse checks were carried out to identify and address employees' specific needs in 2021. In North and South America, for example, surveys  were  conducted  on  the  inclusion  of  diversity.  These revealed a desire to further  embed inclusive behavior in the working environment, among other things. Employees in Germany and Europe were surveyed about their current work situation, flexible working, stresses caused by the coronavirus pandemic and team sentiment. Among other things, the results showed that employees feel safe working at our sites and that employees who have been working flexibly since the start of the pandemic are coping well with it. Regular global employee surveys remain a focus, and we plan to conduct the next survey in spring 2022.\n\n## What we expect from our leaders\n\nOur leaders and their teams should contribute to BASF's success. This is why we promote high-quality leadership and measure its impact. We understand impactful leadership as leaders that serve as role models by having a positive influence on the engagement and development of their employees, and developing and implementing  business  strategies  in  line  with  our  corporate  values. These expectations are part of the standard global nomination criteria for leadership positions. Our leadership culture is based on BASF's corporate values: creative, open, responsible and entrepreneurial - CORE.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur specific expectations of leaders' conduct are derived from these: The  CORE  Leadership  Values serve  as  the  guiding principles for all leaders and set out BASF's expectations of leadership behavior. They are aligned with BASF's strategic goals and reflect our company's leadership vision (see also page 31).\n\nWe offer our leaders a wide variety of learning and development opportunities for each phase of their career as well as various formats that enable them to learn from one another and external experts. Global, regional and local offerings are optimally coordinated.  We  aim  to  develop  leaders  who  lead  their  teams  with optimism, empathy and trust, and in this way, create a competitive advantage for BASF.\n\nIn order to anchor the CORE Leadership Values in day-to-day life, an in-depth training course - CORE Leadership Upskilling - was offered in 2021. The virtual training comprised a series of modules that  encouraged  self-reflection  and  provided  opportunities  for global dialog. The training modules were initially completed by all senior executives worldwide. Work in small, mixed groups aimed to deepen participants' understanding of the CORE Leadership Values, enable in-depth discussion of these and expand global networks. Since the fall of 2021, additional leadership levels have undergone training and activities modeled on CORE Leadership Upskilling.\n\nRegular feedback plays an important role in the development of leaders. We have therefore adapted our global feedback tool to enable leaders to, in the future, even better reflect on how these values are anchored in their leadership behavior.\n\nSince 2020, various existing leadership development tools have been converted to virtual formats to optimally support our leaders including during the challenging times of the coronavirus pandemic.",

We want to reflect this diversity among our employees,  too,  because  it  enables  them  to  better  meet  our customers' needs. For us, diversity means, among other things, having people from different backgrounds working at our company who can draw on their individual perspectives and skills to grow our business. By valuing and promoting employee diversity, we boost  our  teams'  performance  and  power  of  innovation,  and increase creativity, motivation and employees' identification with the   company.\n\nPromoting and valuing diversity across all hierarchical levels is an integral part of our strategy and is also embedded in our corporate values. BASF strives to foster a working environment based on mutual respect, trust and appreciation.  We expect inclusive  conduct from all employees and our leaders. By this, we mean creating an environment in which different aspects of diversity and individual strengths are valued.\n\nOur leaders play an important role in promoting diversity and creating an inclusive work environment. We support them with various offerings, for example as part of leadership development. A toolbox with a wide range of content inspires a change of perspective and a podcast series from leaders shows the importance of appreciative, fair and inclusive leadership.\n\nIntegrating different perspectives is very important to BASF. There are a number of Employee Resource Groups around the world dedicated to different aspects of diversity. In addition, we want to create a greater awareness of diversity in our organization with various activities. BASF supports the German Diversity Charter and has participated in German Diversity Day and European Diversity Month with various virtual initiatives and offerings. At our Ludwigshafen site in Germany, we campaigned against racism and discrimination as part of the International Weeks Against Racism.\n\nBASF is one of approximately 150/uni00A0 companies that support the United Nations Global LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex) Standards of Conduct for business and has done so since 2018. Employees again promoted openness, acceptance and tolerance with many activities to support the LGBTI movement at various sites around the world in 2021.\n\nDiversity also relates to the company's demographic profile, which varies widely by region within the BASF/uni00A0Group. Our aim is to create a suitable framework to help maintain the employability of our personnel at all stages of life and ensure the availability of qualified employees over the long term.\n\n## BASF/uni00A0Group employee age structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also promote diversity in the selection and development of our leaders. We have set a global target to promote female leadership and aim to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions to 30% by 2030. We have made important progress toward this and continuously review our target. In the BASF/uni00A0Group, the global proportion of female leaders with disciplinary responsibility was 25.6% at the end of 2021 (2020: 24.3%).\n\n## 2030 target\n\nProportion of women in leadership positions with disciplinary responsibility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30%\n\nIn order to continuously monitor our progress toward this target, we have developed a global dashboard, which is used to regularly review the implementation status. The systematic advancement of women is also an integral part of our process for selecting senior executives.\n\nAs a signatory to the United Nations' Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs), we are committed to promoting gender equality. We are also involved in other external initiatives to promote inclusion of diversity at work, such as the Chefsache initiative and the European Round  Table.  Employees  from  all  regions  took  International Women's Day/uni00A02021 as an opportunity to reflect on the current situation of women at BASF, celebrate successes and campaign for greater equality.\n\n## Leaders and professionals in the BASF/uni00A0Group\n\n|                     | December/uni00A031, 2021   | Of which women (%)   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|\n| (Senior) executives | 9,006 25.6                 | a                    |\n| Professionals b     | 32.5                       | 40,030               |\n\n- a Employees with disciplinary leadership responsibilities\n- b Specialists without disciplinary leadership responsibilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on diversity in the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see page 167 onward\n\nFor more information on diversity and inclusion, see basf.com/diversity\n\n<!-- image -->",

Having an attractive and compelling total offer package for employees is becoming increasingly important given the strong global competition for the best qualified employees and leaders. This is why we are constantly working on measures to increase BASF's attractiveness in the global labor markets.\n\nWe are increasingly using digital platforms such as our countryspecific career websites as well as global and regional social networks to reach potential candidates. This enables us to appropriately address different target groups.\n\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic, we primarily used digital solutions for our talent search activities in 2021 and participated in a few in-person events. To also provide the best possible information on BASF as an employer virtually, we are continuously developing our digital presence. For example, we are represented at digital trade fairs and conferences, conduct digital excursions for students from various universities of sites in Germany, and organize expert lectures for future talent. This virtual contact enables a demand-oriented, flexible and location-independent approach. As a result, we were able to continue to attract and recruit talented employees.\n\nIn addition, we consistently take part in specific career events to directly reach and attract talent from various disciplines, especially female candidates. We focus in particular on our female employees as role models with various initiatives such as podcasts, career fairs and networking events aimed specifically at women, or on our social media channels.\n\nIn 2021, we established a digital onboarding process at some sites for new employees and their managers in the period up to the first day of work and beyond. The aim is to ensure a successful first day at work and to build an early bond between the new colleagues and their future team at BASF, for example by sending video messages and information about the division and team. We want to continue to drive forward global implementation in 2022.\n\nTo combat the shortage of skilled workers in production and technical areas, due among other factors to demographic-related declines in Ludwigshafen, Germany, we have strengthened our social media presence, for example, to alert qualified specialists to new career prospects at BASF. In addition, we cooperate with local radio stations and the German employment agency to target skilled workers at informational events.\n\nWe once again achieved high scores in a number of employer rankings in 2021. For example, in a study conducted by Universum, young  scientists  ranked  BASF  as  the  second  most  attractive employer in Germany (2020: fifth). In North America, DiversityInc named BASF as one of the top 50/uni00A0companies for diversity in recruiting for the ninth consecutive year. In Asia, Top Employer recognized BASF China as one of the best employers for the twelfth time in succession. In South America, LinkedIn ranked BASF second in its list of top companies in Brazil.\n\nThe  BASF/uni00A0 Group  hired  10,293  new  employees  in  2021.  The percentage of employees who resigned during their first three years of employment - the early turnover rate - was 1.5% worldwide in 2021. This turnover rate was 0.6% in Europe, 2.4% in North America, 3.4% in Asia Pacific and 2.5% in South America, Africa, Middle East. Our early turnover rate is therefore at a desirable low level.\n\n## BASF Group new hires in 2021\n\n|                                    | 2021   |   Of which women (%) |\n|------------------------------------|--------|----------------------|\n| Europe                             | 4,045  |                 30.4 |\n| North America                      | 2,551  |                 29.3 |\n| Asia Pacific                       | 2,797  |                 31   |\n| South America, Africa, Middle East | 900    |                 48.4 |\n| Total                              | 10,293 |                 31.9 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the BASF/uni00A0Group was training 3,028/uni00A0people in 12/uni00A0countries and around 50 occupations. We spent a total of around \u20ac119/uni00A0million on vocational training in 2021.\n\nFor more information on careers at BASF, see basf.com/careers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Learning and development\n\nLearning and development are essential success factors for a strong company culture. The skills and competencies of our employees are critical for profitable growth and lasting success. For this reason, we want to further modernize our learning culture and step up our efforts to promote continuous, self-directed learning and learning from others. Employee development at BASF is guided by the belief that talent is in everyone. This means that development opportunities and support are open to all employees.\n\nIn our understanding, there is more to development than a promotion or a job change - it encompasses the development of personal experience and abilities. In regular development meetings, which are held as part of our annual employee dialogs, employees outline ideas for their individual development together with their leaders and determine specific measures for further training and development, which focus on personal and professional competencies. Our learning  activities  follow  the  '70-20-10'  philosophy:  We  apply  the elements 'learning from experience' (70%), 'learning from others' (20%) and 'learning through courses and media' (10%). Our learning and development offerings cover a range of learning goals: Starting a career, expanding knowledge, personal growth and leadership development.\n\nDigital learning formats play an important role in our development offerings. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, training for leaders and employees was updated to meet the challenges of the digital transformation and modern working life with appropriate learning formats and content. For example, platforms such as the Digital Campus, Digitalization/uni00A0& Me and the Ways of Working portal were enhanced and refined to support employees in all aspects of virtual collaboration and in building their digital skills.

That is why our Future of Work/uni00A0@ BASF initiative  addresses the question of how our teams can find the right balance  bet ween on-site and remote working to continue to perform at their best in the future. Connectedness and close dialog remain our  number one priorities - both are key to team spirit, creativity and innovation. The wide range of jobs, tasks and local conditions make different working models necessary. To reflect this, our  local teams are developing tailored solutions within global guidelines that  meet  individual  requirements.  Workshop  concepts  and training  support the process.\n\nOne example is the Flex Work/uni00A0@ LU project at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany. The focus is on the shift toward greater flexibility as well as practical solutions on how to maintain and strengthen connectedness in an increasingly hybrid working environment from new office concepts to IT solutions and tips for teamwork. The ideas are tested together with pilot units. Successful concepts are made available to all units at the site in the form of a toolbox.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compensation and benefits\n\nWe want to attract and retain engaged and qualified employees, and motivate them to achieve top performance with a total offer package that includes market-oriented compensation, individual development opportunities and a good working environment so that they contribute to the company's long-term success. Our employees' compensation is based on global compensation principles according to position, market and performance. As a rule, compensation comprises fixed and variable components as well as benefits that often exceed legal requirements. In many countries, these benefits include company pension benefits, supplementary health insurance and share programs. We regularly review our compensation systems at the global and local levels.\n\nWe want our employees to contribute to the company's long-term success. This is why the compensation granted to the vast majority of our employees includes variable compensation components, with which they participate in the success of the BASF/uni00A0Group as a whole and are recognized for their individual performance. The same principles basically apply for all employees worldwide. The amount of the variable component is determined by economic success as well as the employee's individual performance. We use the BASF/uni00A0Group's return on capital employed (ROCE) to measure economic success for the purposes of variable compensation . This links variable compensation  to  our  ROCE  target. 1 Individual  performance  is assessed as part of a globally consistent performance management process. In numerous Group companies, our 'plus' share program ensures  employees'  long-term  participation  in  the  company's success through incentive shares. In 2021, for example, around 23,600/uni00A0employees worldwide (2020: around 27,600) participated in the 'plus' share program.\n\nSince 2020, BASF has offered senior executives the opportunity to participate in a long-term incentive (LTI) program 2 in the form of a performance share plan. The LTI program has a term of four years\n\n- 1 In calculating ROCE, adjustments are made for negative and positive special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures (for example, integration costs in connection with acquisitions and gains or losses from the divestiture of businesses) when these exceed a corridor of +/-1% of the average cost of capital basis. An adjustment of the ROCE (in the first 12 months after closing) therefore only occurs in cases of exceptionally high special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures.\n- 2 The LTI program referred to here is aimed at management levels 2 to 4 as well as individual employees who have attained senior executive status by virtue of special expertise. For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see the Compensation Report at basf.com/compensationreport\n\ndevelopment of our employees' digital skills will remain crucial going forward. The portfolio includes offerings for self-directed learning, as well as individual consulting and support for teams and leaders around the digital transformation. Employees and leaders can also hold joint workshops in an avatar-based 3D working and learning environment. In addition, the many academies in the divisions and service units also offer training on specific professional content.\n\nWe  enable  our  employees  to  take  responsibility  for  their  own professional development within the company with digital and novel offerings. To support multidisciplinary teams in the development of products, services or business models, workshops on design thinking  empower  participants  to  find  creative  and  innovative solutions to complex problems. By providing interactive spaces, the concept also lends itself to hybrid working methods. This fosters an agile learning and working culture, which will ultimately also help us to master the digital transformation.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the digital transformation, we support our leaders in questions about shaping the working world of the future . For example, the #liveitleadit program provides insights into various areas of the organization and the opportunity to discuss topics such as hybrid working or living a failure culture.",

To take part in this program, par ticipants must hold BASF shares, the amount of which is based on their individual fixed compensation. In 2021, around 91% of the people eligible to participate in the LTI around the world did so, holding between 30% and 70% of their fixed annual compensation in BASF shares.\n\nThe share price-based compensation program (BASF Option Program, BOP), which had existed since 1999, was offered for the last time in 2020. Around 87% of the people eligible to participate in the program around the world did so, investing up to 30% of their actual variable compensation (for the 2019 business year) in BASF shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on share-price based compensation programs and BASF's share programs, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 280 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see the Compensation Report at basf.com/compensationreport\n\n## Personnel expenses\n\nThe BASF/uni00A0Group's expenses for wages and salaries, social security contributions and assistance, as well as for pensions in 2021 totaled \u20ac11,097/uni00A0million. In 2020, these expenses amounted to \u20ac10,576/uni00A0million and  included personnel expenses from the disposal group for the construction chemicals business in the amount of \u20ac291/uni00A0million until the date of the divestiture. The rise in personnel expenses in 2021 was mainly due to higher bonus provisions. Particularly the lower average number of employees had an offsetting impact.\n\n## BASF/uni00A0Group personnel expenses\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                        | 2021   | 2020   | +/-   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Wages and salaries                                     | 8,847  | 8,416  | +5.1% |\n| Social security contributions and assistance  expenses | 1,519  | 1,424  | +6.7% |\n| Pension expenses                                       | 732    | 736    | -0.5% |\n| Total personnel expenses                               | 11,097 | 10,576 | +4.9% |\n\n## Balancing personal and professional life\n\nOur identity as an employer includes our belief in supporting our employees in balancing their personal and professional lives. We want to strengthen their identification with the company and our position in the global competition for qualified personnel. To achieve this, we have a wide range of offerings aimed at employees in different phases of life that accommodate the growing demand for flexibility in when and where they work. These include flexible working hours, part-time employment, remote working, and time off options that provide the necessary flexibility to care for children or family members. We are constantly working to expand these  options and increasingly support the effective use of digital solutions here.\n\nOur flexible tools proved helpful during the coronavirus pandemic. They help our employees to master the increased challenges around work and personal life during the pandemic and will continue to provide flexibility. To integrate the positive experiences from the surge in remote working into our working culture, we have developed global guiding principles and a framework for the future of work (see box on page 101).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegional initiatives specifically address the needs of our employees at a local level. For example, flexible co-working spaces in the Rhine-Neckar region in Germany were tested in pilot projects and a framework for potential future uses was developed.\n\nOur Work-Life Management employee center in Ludwigshafen, Germany, (LuMit) offers a number of services under one roof: childcare, fitness and health, and social counseling and coaching offered by BASF/uni00A0 Stiftung. Services were adapted so they could continue during the coronavirus pandemic based on the current coronavirus laws and local restrictions. We also provide employee assistance programs at other sites in Germany and around the world to help employees overcome difficult life situations and maintain and restore their employability. Social counseling and coaching also enabled employees and their families to receive extensive support during the coronavirus pandemic, for example by expanding telephone services.\n\n## Dialog with employee representatives\n\nTrust-based cooperation with employee representatives is an important component of our corporate culture. Our open and continual dialog lays the foundation for balancing the interests of the company and its employees, even in challenging situations. In the case of organizational changes or if restructuring leads to staff downsizing, for example, or in the case of codetermination-relevant topics, we involve employee representatives at an early stage to develop socially responsible implementation measures. In 2021, this happened in connection with the planned organizational realignment of research, for example. Our actions are aligned with the respective legal regulations and the agreements reached, as well as opera tional conditions. The organizational protective measures taken during the coronavirus pandemic to date are backed by our employee representatives.",

In China, we work together with trade unions that have been organized locally within the framework of legal possibilities.\n\nFor more information, see basf.com/employeerepresentation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## International labor and social standards\n\nWe act responsibly toward our employees. Part of this is our voluntary commitment to respecting international labor and social standards, which we have embedded in our global Code of Conduct. This encompasses internationally recognized labor norms as stipulated in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy of the International Labour Organization (ILO). BASF is committed  to  complying  with  these  standards  worldwide.  We mainly approach our adherence to international labor and social standards using three elements: the Compliance Program (including compliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as with employee representatives or international organizations) and the BASF guideline on compliance with international labor norms, which applies Group-wide. This guideline makes concrete the topics in our global Code of Conduct under 'Human rights, labor and social standards' as these relate to our employees.\n\nIt forms the basis for our global, risk-based management process: We regularly monitor changes to the national law of all the countries in which BASF operates and evaluate our adherence to international labor and social standards. If the national law contains no or lower requirements, action plans are drawn up to successively close these gaps in a reasonable time frame. If conflicts with national law or practices arise, we strive to act in accordance with our values and internationally recognized principles without violating the law of the country concerned. As part of the management process, we\n\nregularly follow up on and document the results of the comparison between national law and our guideline, as well as measures to implement the guideline. This is part of our central due diligence system. An additional component of our corporate due diligence is our training concept, which was enhanced and refined in 2021. It includes target group-specific training and e-learning modules as well as a global platform for internal dialog.\n\nWe monitor our voluntary commitment to international labor and social standards as part of our management process. As before, individual elements of the guideline are also reviewed as part of internal  control  processes  such  as  Responsible  Care  audits  at BASF/uni00A0 Group companies. In addition to these quality assurance measures, compliance with international labor and social standards is an integral part of the standard questionnaire in the compliance management audits conducted by BASF's Corporate Audit department.\n\n- For more information on global standards, see page 31\n\nFor more information on our responsibility for human rights, see page 104\n\nFor more information on compliance, see page 171 onward\n\nFor more information on standards in our supply chain, see page 109 onward\n\n- For more information on labor and social standards, see basf.com/labor\\_social\\_standards\n\n<!-- image -->",

For many years now, we have engaged in constructive dialog on human rights with other companies, nongovernmental organizations, inter national organizations and multi-stakeholder initiatives to better understand different perspectives and address conflicting goals. BASF is a founding member of the U.N. Global Compact and a member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights (GBI), a group of globally operating companies from various sectors. The initiative aims to ensure implementation of the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Human rights due diligence as a Group-wide task\n- /uni25AA Systematic and extensive anchoring of human rights topics in company processes and culture\n\nWe see human rights due diligence as an important, all-encompassing task that we can only perform by working together as a team throughout the entire organization. That is why we have embedded our responsibility for human rights into our Code of Conduct and set this out in our human rights position. We uphold our standards worldwide, including where they exceed local legal require ments. All employees and leaders are responsible for ensuring that we act in accordance with our Code of Conduct and our human rights  position.\n\nWe rely on a systematic, integrated, risk-based approach and established monitoring and management systems . BASF is also active in initiatives such as Together for Sustainability (TfS) and Responsible Care \u00ae , which promote sustainability in the supply chain. Our measures and criteria for monitoring and observing human\n\nrights are integrated into supplier assessment processes and our global monitoring systems for environmental protection, safety and security, health protection and product stewardship. They are also part of the evaluation of investment, acquisition and divestiture projects, assessments along the entire product life cycle, and systems to monitor labor and social standards. In addition, aspects of human rights topics are part of the global quali fication requirements for our security personnel and are incorporated into agreements with contractors.\n\nOur compliance unit is responsible for steering human rights topics and coordinates the work of the cross-unit Human Rights Expert Working Group, which we established in 2020. In it, employees from specialist units - procurement, legal, HR, environmental protection, health and safety, sustainability strategy, site security, supply chain, communications and government relations - and the operating divisions work closely together. The expert working group provides support and advice in challenging and critical situations, on the development of internal processes, and on the creation of information and training offerings, among other things. This is how we ensure that we approach our human rights responsibility holistically and that we can continually improve our performance.\n\nIn 2020, we conducted a comprehensive review of our human rights  management  system  and  the  related  processes.  This showed  that  we  have  achieved  important  milestones  regarding our due diligence obligations. However, the analysis, which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors, also identified potential for improvement, for example with regard to awareness of human rights topics within our organization and relating to the integration of these topics in our guidelines and processes.\n\nWe therefore launched a global, internal campaign in April/uni00A02021 to raise awareness on the topic of human rights. Externally, we were involved in the U.N.'s International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour through two initiatives and together with other partners, and committed to specific joint measures in the fight against child labor. Together with other DAX-listed companies, we also participated in the study 'Moving with responsibility toward success:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npractical  implementation  of  human  rights  due  diligence  in 10/uni00A0 companies' commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic  Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ).\n\nWe strengthened awareness of our due diligence obligations in procurement by including additional information on human rights topics in training. In addition, the human rights risk assessment is more systematically incorporated into strategy development in our procurement segments (see page 109).\n\nWe also further improved our grievance mechanisms and introduced  a  standardized  global  external  and  internal  hotline  and reporting system in 2021. For example, we expanded the number of languages available. A new website provides information about the hotline and the grievance procedure, and now also offers the option of contacting the company anonymously online in addition to local telephone numbers. Employees can also contact specialists directly via an internal online platform or the corresponding app. The processing status of a submitted report can be tracked anonymously. Moreover, submitted cases will be able to be recorded and evaluated more systematically in the future (see page 171 onward). In 2021, 206/uni00A0human rights-related complaints were received by phone as well as by post and e-mail. All complaints were reviewed and forwarded to the relevant departments for in-depth investigation. If justified, appropriate measures were taken.\n\nWe see assuming our human rights responsibilities as a continuous process. That is why we continuously review our policies and processes and update them whenever necessary. We are currently examining further development measures in various working groups against the backdrop of new regulations such as the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG) and the forthcoming E.U. legislation on due diligence in the supply chain.\n\nWe established a Human Rights Advisory Council in 2020 to systematically  integrate  external  expertise.  Its  members  include independent international human rights experts. The trust-based dialog on human rights topics helps us to better understand different",

At the same time, the renowned external experts show us where we have potential for improvement and help us to build on our strengths in how we handle human rights. The meetings, which are chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer, are also attended by employees from the sustainability strategy and compliance units. Other repre sen tatives, for example, from the operating divisions or procurement, are invited depending on the focus topics. In this way, the Human Rights  Advisory Council provides an external perspective on establishing and improving our processes, and contributes this in discussions with the leadership team.\n\nWe maintained our dialog with the Human Rights Advisory Council throughout 2021, both with the body as a whole and in small groups, and with individual experts. The topics discussed included responsible supply chain management, for example in challenging supplier relationships or in high-risk regions. Our contribution to the responsible use of our solutions and products was also discussed.\n\nIn 2021, we stepped up our commitment to action areas with increased risk potential , such as battery materials (see box on the right). Where conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, their ores and gold) are used, we pay attention to the implementation of the relevant E.U. regulation in our supply and value chains. We also set store on certified sustainable supply chains and fair working conditions in the procurement of raw materials such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and castor oil. We maintain dialog with national and international NGOs and are involved in numerous networks and partnerships (see page/uni00A0113 onward). These include the Cobalt for Development initiative in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Responsible Lithium Partnership in Chile, the Global Battery Alliance and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).\n\nAs an international company, we are a part of society in the countries in which we operate and have business relationships with partners around the world. We are confronted by the fact that there are states that do not honor their obligation to protect human rights. People are particularly at risk in such countries and companies' ability to act is often limited. We are committed to our values -\n\nincluding and especially there - and contribute to the respect of human rights.\n\nWe have trustful working relationships with our partners (customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, contractors), expect them to comply with internationally recognized human rights standards and to demand the same of their partners further along the value chain. We support  our  partners  in  their  efforts  to  meet  their  respective responsibilities.\n\nWe can only meet our goal of eradicating human rights abuses along our value chains if we work together. We have defined our expectations in a binding Supplier Code of Conduct . We are in close contact with our business partners, especially in higher-risk areas and regions, and monitor the implementation of required standards  and  measures  for  improvement.  We  use  recognized assessments and audits to verify this.\n\n## Good to know\n\n## Battery Minerals Task Force\n\nIn 2021, BASF established a Battery Minerals Task Force to meet the specific challenges associated with the growing demand for battery materials. It bundles the expertise of the Catalysts division and various functional units. The initiative was formed to address the risks and opportunities of our global raw material supply chains for battery materials from a sustainability viewpoint and steer the resulting activities. The aim is to ensure the responsible procurement of battery materials. The task force is also responsible for the ongoing development of our internal guidelines to ensure their continuous improvement and adaptation to new regulatory requirements, as well as to take account of developments in our business areas.\n\nFor more information on supplier management, see page 109 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on mineral raw materials, see page 115 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe report on our global targets, monitoring systems and measures to integrate human rights topics into our business activities in publications such as this report and online.\n\n- For more information on standards in our supply chain, see page 109 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on raw materials, see page 112 onward\n\nFor more information on our production standards, see page 119 onward\n\nFor more information on systems for monitoring labor and social standards, see page 103 onward\n\nFor more information on corporate governance and compliance, see page 161 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See basf.com/humanrights for more information on the human rights position and a comprehensive report on the implementation of due diligence in human rights in accordance with the requirements of the National Action Plan developed by the German government, and in accordance with the U.N./uni00A0Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n\nFor more information on the Human Rights Advisory Council, see basf.com/human-rights-council",

Global Compact (UNGC) since its establishment in 2000. As a recognized LEAD company , we contribute to the implementation of the Agenda 2030 and the associated goals. For example, we support the UNGC action platforms, including the Sustainable Finance platform in the form of the CFO Taskforce for the SDGs, and the Decent Work in Global Supply Chains action platform, in which company representatives and experts discuss how respecting human and labor rights is crucial to achieving the SDGs. With the six-month SDG Ambition program, the UNGC and the German Global Compact Network (DGCN) support participating companies in aligning their sustainability targets more closely with the SDGs and deriving specific measures from them. BASF is also active in 13 local Global Compact networks.\n\nIn 2021, we again discussed relevant sustainability topics with the Stakeholder Advisory Council . Focus topics included climate protection, the energy transformation and food security. Topics discussed by the Human Rights Advisory Council, which is chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer, included particular challenges in the battery materials value chain.\n\nWe promote digital dialog on sustainability topics. In November 2021, we held the second hackathon as part of the Climathon initiative in North and South America, where employees developed digital solutions for sustainability topics.\n\n- For more information on stakeholder dialog, see basf.com/en/stakeholder-dialog\n- For more information on our guidelines for responsible lobbying, see basf.com/guidelines\\_political\\_communication\n\nFor more information on the Industry Associations Review, see basf.com/corporategovernance\n\n## Societal Engagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n203, 413\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA BASF a responsible neighbor at sites worldwide\n- /uni25AA New business models improve local living conditions\n\nThrough our societal engagement, we want to address the needs of the communities surrounding our production sites worldwide, help achieve the SDGs, and have a positive long-term impact on the environment and society. This is why societal engagement is a cornerstone of our corporate social responsibility. It encompasses the focus areas of health, skills and resources.\n\nWe work with partners worldwide to promote public health , for example, to combat malaria. Through our New Nets project in cooperation with The Global Fund, Unitaid and other financial partners, approximately 25 million of our Interceptor \u00ae G2 mosquito nets had been distributed in African countries as of December 2021. These were specially developed to counter insecticide resistance in the fight against malaria and contain two different insecticides. The project goal is to distribute a total of around 35 million nets by the end of 2022.\n\nAt the U.N. Food Systems Summit 2021, BASF signed the Zero Hunger Private Sector Pledge and announced that it would invest $11 million in initiatives in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, such as for seed production, malaria prevention and food  fortification\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nas well as smallholder projects. The projects aim to help achieve SDG 2 by 2030 (Zero hunger). Forty-three companies signed the pledge, which is implemented by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and other international organizations.\n\nAs a responsible neighbor and a partner in the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region in Germany, our societal engagement strategy strengthens  the  participation  and  integration  of  disadvantaged groups, and promotes research and discovery.\n\nWith  Wissensfabrik  -  Unternehmen  f\u00fcr  Deutschland  e.V.,  we promote  a  network  of  around  130  companies  and  corporate foundations that sponsor educational institutions and start-ups to support children, young people, students and young entrepreneurs. The focus is on school projects that provide hands-on experience with STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the project's initiatives (such as IT2School - Gemeinsam IT entdecken and KiTec - Kinder entdecken Technik) were also offered in digital formats, allowing these educational programs to continue even as school operations were restricted. In the new City4Future project launched in early 2022, schoolchildren explore topics related to energy, climate change and sustainability through play and can develop ideas for the urban living space of the future.\n\nIn South America, BASF initiated the Connect to Transform open call and has so far supported 48 social and environmental projects, such as the Gera\u00e7\u00e3o Futura Institute's M\u00e3o na Massa project near our local site in the S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo region. The project trains women as bakers to promote their financial and personal autonomy.\n\nWe aim to create long-term value for BASF and society with new business  models  and  cross-sector  partnerships.  Our Starting Ventures  program helps people from low-income areas to improve their economic opportunities and their quality of life. The program also provides access to new markets and partners, and contributes to reaching the SDGs. A new internal application round for Starting Ventures projects was launched in October 2021.

This pyrolysis oil is used as feedstock in the  production of high-quality chemical products. In cooperation with nonprofit organizations, this will enable local waste collectors and their families to earn a regular income.\n\n## BASF Group expenses for societal engagement activities\u00b9\n\n## ~\u20ac30 million\n\nIn  the  area  of international  development  cooperation ,  we support the independent charitable BASF Stiftung with donations for its projects in cooperation with various organizations. The 2021 year-end donation campaign in favor of BASF Stiftung supported the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, which celebrated its 75th anniversary. Together with the Indian organization ChildLine and other partners, UNICEF is working to provide psychosocial care for children in India who have had difficulty accessing important services as a result of the pandemic. BASF doubled the donations made by employees of participating German Group companies to a total of around \u20ac600,000.\n\nBASF also made donations to support those affected by natural disasters in 2021. In July, BASF donated \u20ac1 million to flood relief in Germany,  which  hit  the  states  of  North  Rhine-Westphalia  and Rhineland-Palatinate particularly hard. The donation went to the German Red Cross, which was active in these crisis regions. In August, BASF doubled the amount donated by employees at its\n\nGerman sites (\u20ac702,668 in total) to around \u20ac1.4 million. BASF Stiftung distributed the donations to affected private households and charitable institutions. In September, BASF donated $500,000 to disaster relief following Hurricane Ida and for long-term recovery efforts in Louisiana. Local nonprofit organizations used $300,000 of this amount for emergency relief and reconstruction. In addition, $200,000 went to supporting BASF employees who were directly impacted by the effects of the hurricane.\n\n- For more information on Starting Ventures, see basf.com/en/starting-ventures\n\nFor more information on societal engagement at our sites, see ludwigshafen.basf.de\n\nFor more information on our societal engagement around the world, see basf.com/en/engagement\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, we continued to use our expertise in research, production, procurement and logistics to support people affected by the pandemic around the world.\n\nIn  April  2021,  BASF  opened  the first  accredited  corporate corona virus vaccination center in Germany at its Ludwigs hafen site.  More  than  22,000  primary  vaccinations  and  more  than 21,000/uni00A0 secondary  vaccinations  were  administered  there  from April to  August and more than 10,000 booster vaccinations were administered there in December to BASF employees, contractors and site partners. The coronavirus vaccination center was established and operated by an interdisciplinary team from various BASF units,  coordinated by Corporate Health Management.\n\nA global working group in our Pharma Solutions business unit has supported pharmaceutical companies in their research on vaccines and therapies to combat COVID-19 since March/uni00A02020. The task force reviews patent applications, clinical trials and scientific publications to identify potential collaborations with companies. BASF is currently supporting the global development of more than 80 therapies with its ingredients and expertise.\n\nBASF products were used to cool coronavirus vaccines . For instance,  Elastopir \u00a9 insulation panels were produced in cooperation with a partner in Malaysia and used to equip refrigerated warehouses in Asia. In cooperation with various partners in Germany, Neopor \u00ae and Styropor \u00ae , BASF's expandable polystyrenes (EPS), were used to produce boxes to transport COVID-19 vaccines due to their good insulating and shock-absorbing properties.\n\nIn 2021, BASF also provided in-kind support around the world to overcome the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. For example, BASF donated molecular sieves to the Indian government to facilitate the production of medical oxygen. Medical equipment, including ventilators, was also donated, and acute care units were set up in Mumbai together with partners. We donated medical equipment to Malaysian hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.  In  South  America,  BASF  launched  a  food  drive  and donated food packages to communities around BASF sites. The food  was  distributed  there  to  those  in  need  with  the  help  of employees who volunteered their time.\n\nFor more information on the Helping Hands aid campaign, see basf.com/en/helping-hands\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our partnerships with suppliers are based on mutual value creation, as well as a reliable supply of raw materials, technical goods and services at competitive prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF sources a wide range of raw materials, precursors, technical goods and services. Our suppliers are an important part of our value chain. Our objective is to secure competitive advantages  through  our  professional  procurement  structures, to establish stable and reliable supply chains, and at the same time, meet high ethical and environmental standards.

Our sustainabilityoriented supply chain management is an integral part of our risk management. We have defined our standards and processes in a global guideline. We are continually refining and optimizing this to respond to changes in the regulatory environment and new requirements resulting, for example, from new laws and initiatives at  national and international level. Procurement management systems such as guidelines  and  targets  are  set  centrally  and  are  binding  for  all employees with procurement responsibility worldwide.\n\nOur risk-based approach aims to identify and evaluate sustainability matters in our value chains as best possible to improve sustain ability together with our suppliers. We regularly review and document progress based on the risk level. Employees with procurement responsibility  receive  ongoing  training  in  sustainability-oriented supplier  management  and  responsible  procurement.  In  2021, 250/uni00A0BASF employees received such training.\n\nOur  expectations  of  our  suppliers  are  laid  down  in  the  global Sup plier Code of Conduct. This creates clarity around the standards to  be  met.  We  count  on  reliable  supplier  relationships  and support our suppliers in implementing our requirements. In 2021, we also launched the Supplier CO2 Management Program. With\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this section: Supplier Management Raw Materials\n\nthis  program, we want to systematically gather data on upstream Scope/uni00A0 3 emissions to identify medium-term measures for optimization (see page/uni00A0 130). We make our suppliers' contribution to sustainable  development transparent for us and for our  stakeholders.\n\n- For more information on suppliers, see basf.com/suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global targets\n\nWe actively promote sustainability in the supply chain and have set ourselves ambitious targets for this: By 2025, we aim to have conducted  sustainability  evaluations  for  90%  of  the  BASF  Group's relevant  spend 2 and will develop action plans where improvement is necessary. In addition, we aim to have 80% of suppliers improve their  sustainability  performance  upon  re-evaluation  by  2025.  In 2021, 85% of the relevant spend had been evaluated. Of the suppliers re-evaluated in 2021, 74% had improved. Both global targets are embedded in the target agreements of persons responsible for procurement.\n\n## Worldwide procurement\n\nOur more than 70,000 suppliers make an important contribution to our value creation. We work in long-term partnership with companies from different industries around the world. They supply us with raw materials, precursors, investment goods and consumables, perform a range of services and are innovation partners.",

Of this, around 90% was procured locally. 1 There were no substantial changes to our supplier structure.\n\n## What we expect from our suppliers\n\nTogether with our suppliers, we want to improve sustainability in the supply chain. Consequently, we expect our suppliers to comply with the applicable laws in full and to adhere to internationally recognized environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards. We also expect our suppliers to make an effort to enforce these standards at their suppliers. In addition, we ask our suppliers to acknowledge, support and abide by our Supplier Code of Conduct - or to demonstrate and ensure their commitment to the principles specified in the Code of Conduct, for example in their own code of conduct.\n\nOur global Supplier Code of Conduct is founded on interna tionally recognized guidelines, such as the principles of the United Nations' Global  Compact,  the  U.N.  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and Human Rights, the International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions and the topic areas of the Responsible Care initiative. Topics covered by the Code of Conduct include compliance with human rights, the exclusion of child and forced labor, safeguarding labor and social standards, antidiscrimination and anticorruption policies, and protecting the environment. The Code of Conduct is available in the most relevant languages for our suppliers and integrated into\n\nelectronic ordering systems and purchasing conditions across the Group. We revised our Supplier Code of Conduct in 2021 and added our expectations around the procurement of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, their ores and gold). Around 5,900/uni00A0 new suppliers committed to the Code of Conduct in 2021.\n\nBASF conducts audits and assessments to ensure that suppliers comply with the applicable laws, rules and standards. BASF  reserves the right to discontinue business relationships for non-adherence to international principles. The same applies to failure to correct violations, or for displaying patterns of non-compliance with these standards. Our Code of Conduct expressly points out that potential violations of laws, rules or standards can be reported - including anonymously - to our compliance hotlines. Each case is documented and investigated, and appropriate measures are taken as necessary.\n\n## Selection and evaluation of our suppliers\n\nNew suppliers are selected and existing suppliers are evaluated not only on the basis of economic criteria, but also ESG standards. As such, selection, evaluation and auditing is an important part of our sustainable supply chain management. Processes and responsibilities are defined in a global guideline. Due to the large number of suppliers, they are evaluated based on risk . We take into account the materiality of the supply relationship and country and industryspecific risks. We also use observations from our employees in procurement and information from internal and external databases, such as TfS assessments.\n\nWe have suppliers with a high potential sustainability risk evaluated by third parties, either through sustainability evaluations or on-site audits. The list of suppliers to be assessed is updated every year. Sustainability evaluations and on-site audits are mainly conducted according to the TfS framework. A total of 86 raw material supplier sites were audited on sustainability standards on our behalf in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Together for Sustainability (TfS)\n\nBASF is a founding member of Together for Sustainability (TfS). The initiative was established in 2011 to improve sustainability in the supply chain. The focus is on standardizing and simplifying supplier audits and evaluations globally. This increases transparency and creates synergies: Suppliers only have to complete an assessment process once. The results are then made available to all TfS members and are mutually recognized - saving time and money for both parties. Suppliers are evaluated by independent experts either in on-site audits or online assessments. The latter are conducted by EcoVadis, a ratings agency specialized in sustainability analyses.\n\nA new program on Scope 3 emissions was launched in 2021. The aim is to develop a methodology for the chemical industry to calculate upstream greenhouse gas emissions in particular. TfS members can use this data to implement and manage emissions reduction programs.\n\nAt the end of 2021, TfS had 34 members with a combined procurement spend of around \u20ac267 billion. A total of 284 audits and 5,817 online assessments were performed. As a TfS member, BASF itself is assessed and in 2021 was ranked among the top 1% companies worldwide in the sustainable procurement category.\n\nFor more information on Together for Sustainability, see tfs-initiative.com\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "We received sustainability evaluations for 701/uni00A0 suppliers. We also take into account other certification systems and external audits, such  as  from  the  Roundtable  on  Sustainable  Palm  Oil,  when assessing our suppliers. Depending on business requirements, we additionally conduct our own Responsible Care audits at selected suppliers (see page 117).\n\n## Audit results\n\nWe carefully analyze the results of our assessments and document them in a central database. The on-site supplier audits conducted over the past few years have identified some need for adjustment with respect to environmental, social and corporate governance standards, for example in waste management or deviations in occupational health and safety measures and standards under labor law. Follow-up audits in 2021 identified improvements, for example, a reduction in health and safety risks following the implementation of appropriate measures and compliance with labor law requirements. In 2021, none of our audits identified any instances of child labor or dangerous work and overtime performed by persons under 18.\n\nWe maintained close dialog with our South African platinum supplier Sibanye-Stillwater 1 in 2021 on the results of the audit from 2020, the implementation  of  the  resulting  action  plan,  and  other  relevant topics. This includes working with all stakeholders, including local authorities, to take a unified approach to community development. Almost all the needs for adjustment identified by the audit had been implemented by the end of 2021. BASF and Sibanye-Stillwater continue to discuss the progress made four times a year and also use this as a platform for dialog on other sustainability topics. Sibanye-Stillwater is a member and supporter of the International Platinum Group Metals Association (IPA) sustainability initiative that was co-founded by BASF. The initiative's measures include conducting comprehensive sustainability audits and sharing factors for success. BASF continued its regular dialog with local stakeholder\n\ngroups in 2021. It also facilitated direct dialog between SibanyeStillwater and nongovernmental organizations active in this area.\n\nWe discuss sustainability matters with our supplier Nornickel and other aspects relevant to our cooperation on a monthly basis. These include current events and the findings from the mining-specific TfS audits. In 2021, TfS audits were carried out at Nornickel's site in Polar, Russia. Nornickel seeks to join various industry initiatives that provide third-party verification of mining and responsible procurement standards, such as the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) or the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA). In addition, topics relevant to stakeholders were discussed in meetings with interest groups. The dialogs continue in various forms.\n\n## Supplier development\n\nWe use TfS evaluations to pursue a risk-based approach with  clearly defined, BASF-specific follow-up processes. If we identify deviations from  standards,  we  ask  suppliers  to  develop  and  implement corrective measures within a reasonable time frame. We support them in their efforts, for example by training employees from 31/uni00A0suppliers in China on ESG topics in 2021 as part of a partnership with the East China University of Science and Technology. In South America, around 190/uni00A0suppliers took part in a diversity talk on gender equality in the supply chain, and around 340/uni00A0suppliers attended a webinar on ethical principles, legislation and human rights in the supply chain.\n\nAs part of TfS, training was also developed for suppliers undergoing a sustainability evaluation for the first time and for suppliers that already have a sustainability rating but have potential for improvement in ESG performance. In 2021, more than 1,800/uni00A0participants attended online TfS training on this topic in different languages. TfS is also developing a global learning platform for buyers and suppliers, which will provide various (online) training opportunities on specific sustainability topics. It is scheduled for launch in 2022.\n\n- 1 In 2012, an extended strike at a platinum mine in Marikana, South Africa, culminated in a violent confrontation between mine workers and armed South African police. Employees of the former mine operator, Lonmin, were among the fatalities. Ownership of the Marikana mine was transferred to Sibanye-Stillwater in 2019. For more information on the supplier relationship with the Sibanye-Stillwater mine, see basf.com/en/marikana\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe review our suppliers' progress according to a defined timeframe based on the sustainability risk identified, or after five years at the latest. In the case of ongoing, serious violations of the standards defined in our Supplier Code of Conduct or international principles, we reserve the right to impose commercial sanctions. These can go as far as termination of the business relationship. In 2021, this happened in three cases.",

Using resources as efficiently and responsibly as possible and the concept of the circular economy are firmly embedded in our strategy and our actions, for example, by our Verbund structure and the increased use of renewable and recycled feedstocks. We expect our suppliers to source and produce raw materials responsibly.\n\n## At a glance\n\n35,000 different raw materials\n\npurchased\n\n## 1.3/uni00A0million metric tons\n\nrenewable raw materials purchased\n\n- /uni25AA BASF's Verbund concept enables the efficient use of resources\n- /uni25AA Recycled and renewable raw materials are gaining in importance\n- /uni25AA Numerous projects to improve supply chain sustainability\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur  strategy  covers  the  entire  value  chain  -  from  responsible procurement and the efficient use and recycling of raw materials in our processes to developing resource-saving solutions for our customers. We want to decouple growth from resource consumption with process and product innovations to accelerate the shift toward closed-loop value creation systems. Alongside economic, environmental and social criteria, we also consider aspects such as product safety and supply security when selecting suppliers and raw materials.\n\nOur expectations of our suppliers are laid down in our Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 109). We take a closer look at suppliers in critical supply chains, for example mineral raw materials, renewable resources such as palm kernel oil, a number of pigments and highly toxic substances. Upstream stages of the value chain are assessed for serious sustainability risks and, if necessary, suitable remedial measures are identified. In addition, we develop and test approaches to make the supply of raw materials more sustainable in joint initiatives with suppliers and other partners. Examples include our cooperative ventures and investments to recycle batteries (see page 30) and our joint activities on certified sustainable supply chains for  renewable raw materials such as palm, palm kernel and castor oil.\n\nBASF's Verbund concept is key to making the use of raw materials in our own processes as efficient as possible: Intelligently linking and steering our plants and processes creates efficient value chains. By-products from one facility are used as feedstocks elsewhere. This saves raw materials and energy (see page 128). At the same time, the Verbund offers many opportunities to use renewable and recycled raw materials. We want to better leverage this potential going forward. For example, we are driving forward chemical recycling of mixed plastic waste and used tires in our ChemCycling TM project (see page 115).\n\nResource efficiency and stewardship are also becoming increasingly important topics for our customers. That is why we are constantly working to reduce the resources consumed in the manufacturing of our products, for example through more efficient processes, innovative technologies and the use of renewable and recycled raw materials. This enables us to offer our customers solutions that make a greater contribution to sustainability, like a smaller carbon footprint and better biodegradability. Our products also improve our customers' resource efficiency and sustainability in many areas. For example, BASF additives increase the service life and mechanical\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecyclability of plastics, which saves fossil resources and avoids CO2 emissions.\n\n- For more information on our supplier management, see page 109 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the circular economy, see page 44\n\n## Fossil and petrochemical resources\n\nBASF's most important raw materials (based on volume) include gas and crude oil-based petrochemical products such as naphtha and benzene. We mainly use liquid gas and natural gas to generate energy and steam, and to produce key basic chemicals such as ammonia or acetylene. Naphtha is mainly fed into our steam cracker, where it is split into products such as ethylene and propylene - both important feedstocks for numerous value chains. We use aromatics such as benzene or toluene to manufacture engineering plastics, among other products. Thanks to a high degree of forward and backward integration, we can produce many feedstocks for our value chains efficiently while conserving resources within the BASF Verbund. This increases supply security and reduces dependence on external supply sources to just a few key raw materials. We source these from different suppliers to minimize supply risks.\n\nAs part of our efforts to improve sustainability, we are continuously investigating whether fossil and petrochemical resources can be replaced with non-fossil alternatives . We carefully consider economic, environmental and social aspects, as well as other important criteria like supply security and product safety. Our aim is to increase the share of renewable and recycled feedstocks in our value chains. This brings with it challenges and compromises in the supply of both energy  and  resources  for  carbon-based  organic  chemistry.  For example, the use of renewable energy can involve additional costs, which can have an impact on competitiveness. Another area of conflict arises, for example, when the increased consumption of renewable raw materials leads to greater land use. We raise awareness of these trade-offs through close dialog with our stakeholders. We are also involved in sustainability initiatives to develop and implement solutions in cooperation with partners.",

        "page_content": "## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The mass balance approach\n\nMany BASF value chains start in syngas plants or steam crackers, where fossil resources, mostly natural gas and naphtha, are converted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide or important basic chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. These are used to create thousands of products in the BASF Verbund. Alongside fossil resources, bio-based and recycled raw materials such as biomethane, bio-naphtha or pyrolysis oil can be used as feedstocks in our plants. Due to the simultaneous processing of fossil, bio-based and recycled feedstocks, the raw materials cannot be directly assigned to resulting derivatives. The share of bio-based or recycled raw materials can however be allocated  to derivatives using the mass balance approach, which is audited by a third party, and certification (such as the REDcert 2 standard for the chemical industry). It is similar in principle to green power, which has been established for many years: Energy from renewable sources is fed into the grid and then charged to individual customers.\n\nMass balance products are identical in quality to conventionally produced products but have a better sustainability balance due to the use of bio-based or recycled raw materials. This method has already been applied to over 700 BASF products (2020: ~200 products), for example, engineering plastics such as polyamide, superabsorbents, dispersions and intermediates. We share our expertise in numerous stakeholder platforms, such as the European Commission's  Circular  Plastics  Alliance,  to  harmonize  and  standardize different allocation methods and certification schemes for mass balance products.\n\nFor more information, see basf.com/massbalance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Renewable resources\n\nIn addition to fossil resources, we employ renewable raw materials, mainly based on vegetable oils, fats, grains, sugar and wood. In 2021, we purchased around 1.3/uni00A0 million metric tons of renewable raw materials. For instance, we use renewable resources to produce ingredients for the detergent and cleaner industry, or to source natural active ingredients for the cosmetics industry. We also use renewable  feedstocks  such  as  biomethane  and  bio-naphtha  in  our Verbund as an alternative to fossil resources. The mass balance approach allows us to allocate the amount of renewable resources used to a wide variety of end products (see box at left). Examples include the Acronal \u00ae Eco and Joncryl \u00ae MB biomass balance binders for solvent-free paints and coatings, the HySorb \u00ae Biomass Balanced superabsorbent, various biomass balance versions from the Trilon \u00ae , Sokalan \u00ae and Protectol \u00ae product lines for the detergent and cleaner industry,  and  the  biomass  balance  versions  of  our  Styropor \u00ae , Neopor \u00ae and Styrodur \u00ae insulation materials.\n\nAs  for  fossil  raw  materials,  we  also  consider  how  renewable resources impact sustainability topics along the value chain. Alongside positive effects like saving greenhouse gas emissions, these can also have negative effects on areas such as biodiversity, land use or working conditions, depending on the raw material. This is why we carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of using renewable resources, for example using Eco-Efficiency Analyses. We also take recognized certification standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil into account in our decisions.\n\nWe want to minimize raw material-specific risks and increase sustainability in our supply chains with measures, projects and targeted involvement in initiatives. Our activities here concentrate on value chains that are relevant quantitatively or that do not yet have certification standards. We are also working on product innovations and on enhancing our production processes to improve the profitability and competitiveness of renewable resources. For example, we are developing innovative processes such as biocatalysis and fermentation for the production of vitamins and enzymes; and we are",

        "page_content": "driving forward white biotechnology for the production of chemical components from renewable resources.\n\nPalm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives are some of our most important renewable raw materials. We mainly use these raw materials  to  produce  ingredients  for  the  cosmetics,  detergent, cleaner and food industries. We aim to ensure that palm-based raw materials come from certified sustainable sources. To this end, we have endorsed the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) since 2004 and are engaged in other national and international initiatives, such as the German Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil, the Polish coalition Polska  Koalicja ds. Zr\u00f3wnowazonego  Oleju Palmowego and the High Carbon Stock Approach organization. Based on our Group-wide Supplier Code of Conduct (see page/uni00A0109), we have outlined our expectations of suppliers in the palm-based value chain in an additional sourcing policy (BASF Palm Sourcing Policy). This addresses aspects such as forest and peat conservation, respect of human and labor rights, smallholder inclusion, and certification  and  traceability  standards.  The  annual  BASF  Palm Progress Report reports on our measures and progress toward more sustainability and transparency in the value chain.\n\nWe purchased 242,946/uni00A0metric tons of palm oil and palm kernel oil in 2021 (2020: 227,213/uni00A0metric tons). We again met our own voluntary commitment to source only RSPO-certified palm oil and palm kernel oil. This avoided more than 330,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions compared with the procurement of conventional palm oil and palm kernel oil. By 2025, we aim to extend our voluntary commitment to sustainable procurement to the main intermediate products 1 based on palm oil and palm kernel oil. We were able to trace 96% of our global palm footprint to oil mill level as of the end of 2021 (2020: 95% 2 ). In addition, we continued to drive forward the RSPO supply chain certification of our sites for cosmetic ingredients. At the end of 2021, 26/uni00A0 production sites worldwide were certified by the RSPO (2020: 25). In line with raised awareness for sustainability, we  continue to see growing demand for certified palm-based products from our customers. We are expanding our range of certified\n\n- 1 Fractions and primary oleochemical derivatives as well as vegetable oil esters\n- 2 The figure for 2020 was adjusted from 96% to 95% due to a data correction.\n\nsustainable products in accordance with the RSPO's mass balance supply chain model. This helps our customers meet their obligations to customers, consumers and stakeholders.\n\nWe source most of our palm-based raw materials from Malaysia and Indonesia. Smallholders account for around one-third of the total volumes produced there. We have worked together with The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, the RSPO and Solidaridad in Indonesia since 2019 to expand our supplier base for RSPO-certified palm oil products  while  strengthening  smallholder  structures  and  sustainable production  methods  at  local  level.  The  project  in  the  province of Lampung supports around 1,000 independent smallholders in improving their livelihoods and the sustainable production of palm oil and palm kernel oil. The focus is on efficient and sustainable farming practices and health and safety standards. The goal is for at least one-third of program participants to become certified according to the RSPO Smallholder Standard in three years.\n\nAlso important for BASF, albeit at a much smaller scale, is castor oil . We use castor oil to manufacture products such as plastics and ingredients for paints and coatings, as well as products for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. With the aim of establishing a certified sustainable supply chain for castor oil, we launched the Sustainable Castor Initiative - Pragati in 2016 together with the companies Arkema and Jayant Agro and the NGO Solidaridad. The initiative is intended to improve the economic situation of castor bean farmers in India and, at the same time, raise awareness of sustainable farming methods. Around 80% of the world's castor beans are produced in India, mainly by smallholders. As part of Pragati, smallholder farmers receive training on topics such as cultivation methods, efficient water use, health and the safe use of crop protection  products  based  on  a  specially  developed  sustainability code, SuCCESS. Since the project was initiated, more than 5,800/uni00A0 smallholders and over 13,300/uni00A0 hectares of land have been certified for sustainable castor cultivation. Yields from this land were 35% higher than average amounts for the region published by the local government for the 2020/2021 harvest cycle. In addition to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuCCESS, the Sustainable Castor Association (SCA), which was launched in 2019 by the founders of the Pragati initiative, has also developed a sustainability code for the wider supply chain. This will allow castor beans obtained from the program to be further processed into certified castor oil and derivatives and to be introduced into the downstream supply chain. We were able to source the first certified sustainable castor oil from the program in 2021 following the successful audit of our supply chain by an independent certification body. In the coming years, we want to increase the share of this oil in our total demand.\n\nOur bioactives for cosmetics are based on plants. Through sustainable sourcing practices, we aim to preserve ecosystems and enable sustainable management for those who depend on them. To this end, we have set up various programs that unite economic, ecological and social aspects in holistic approaches. One example is our rambutan program in Vietnam's Dong Nai province. We have been collaborating since 2014 with two local small plantations which supply us with sustainably produced, organically certified raw materials. Upcycling the rambutan tree's shells, leaves and seeds, previously disposed of as waste, creates new income streams for farmers and expands our portfolio of natural active ingredients. The partnership focuses in particular on responsible farming practices and social inclusion, including gender equality, safe working conditions and fair incomes.\n\nAnother example of sustainable supply chains and responsible innovation is our Castaline\u2122 product, derived from the leaves of chestnut trees. These are harvested in late summer by forest owners in France. The chestnut forests are organically certified and are mainly used for the cultivation of chestnuts. By upcycling the leaves as a by-product of chestnut extraction, we generate additional income opportunities for forest owners and provide our customers with a product of completely natural origin. We are pursuing other similar",

We want to increase the use of recycled feedstocks with our Circular Economy Program: From 2025 onward, we aim to process around 250,000/uni00A0metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials every year worldwide, replacing fossil raw materials (see page 44).\n\nA focal point of our activities here is chemically recycling plastic waste. This technology complements mechanical recycling and can help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is disposed of in landfill or thermally recovered. Chemical recycling breaks down plastics into their building blocks or converts them into basic chemicals. Different methods are used to achieve this.\n\nIn  our  ChemCycling TM project,  our  technology  partners  use  the pyrolysis process to extract pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste or used tires, which were not previously recycled. We can feed this pyrolysis oil into our Verbund as an alternative to fossil raw materials and use it to make new products. These have exactly the same properties as products manufactured from fossil feedstocks. We use a certified mass balance approach to allocate the percentage of recycled content to the end product (see page 113). In 2021, we were able to further expand our portfolio of these Ccycled TM products. It now comprises around 50 products that our customers use, for example to manufacture transport cases for medicine, high-performance plastics for the automotive industry, packaging materials and functional textiles. We also signed a memorandum of understanding in 2021 with our technology partner Quantafuel and Remondis, a global leader in waste and water management. Its\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmetals from scrap of cell manufacturers and battery material producers that do not meet product specifications.\n\nFor more information on the circular economy, see page 44\n\n## Mineral raw materials\n\nWe procure a number of mineral raw materials, which we use to produce automotive and process catalysts or battery materials, among other products. We are continually improving our products and processes to minimize the use of primary mineral raw materials. At the same time, we are driving forward the recycling of mineral raw materials, for example, by recovering platinum metals from automotive  and  process  catalysts  and  using  these  as  secondary resources (see 'Recycled feedstocks').\n\nSourcing mineral raw materials responsibly is important to BASF. We implemented measures to meet the requirements of the E.U.  Conflict Minerals Regulation by the January/uni00A01, 2021 deadline. This defines supply chain due diligence for tin, tantalum, tungsten, their ores and gold (3TG) imported into the E.U. from conflict-affected and highrisk areas (CAHRAs). To supplement our Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 109), we introduced a Group-wide Supply Chain Policy for Conflict Minerals in 2021. It contains expectations for our suppliers from CAHRAs and outlines voluntary  commitments.\n\nIn addition to responsible procurement of the 3TG minerals, BASF is committed to responsible and sustainable global supply chains for other mineral raw materials as well. These include cobalt , a key component in the production of battery materials for electric vehicles, among other applications. Our cobalt supply chain is organized according to special sustainability criteria. Our goal is to not purchase cobalt from artisanal mines and to exclude this in supply chains as long as responsible artisanal production cannot be verified.\n\nTogether with BMW, Samsung SDI, Samsung Electronics, Volkswagen and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), we have been involved in the cross-industry Cobalt for Development initiative since 2018. It aims to improve working and living\n\nsubject matter is the assessment of a joint investment in a pyrolysis plant for plastic waste.\n\nWe have also made further progress with the chemical recycling of used mattresses made of flexible polyurethane. It is based on a wet chemical process developed by BASF. After initial successful trials, our teams continued developing the process in 2021. Precursors recovered from old mattresses can now be used to produce new mattress-sized blocks of flexible polyurethane foam. The new process is currently being optimized and tested on a larger scale.\n\nWe have many years of experience and a high degree of specialization in recycling precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. They are used in automotive catalysts as well as in process and chemical catalysts. We primarily use the precious metals recovered in this way as feedstocks in catalyst production. With the expansion of our refinery plant in Seneca, South Carolina, and the acquisition of assets from Zodiac Enterprises in Caldwell, Texas, we are further expanding our leading position in platinum group metal recycling.\n\nThe growing demand for electromobility is also increasing the need for lithium-ion battery recycling . As a leading producer of battery materials with future local production capacities in the three main markets - Asia, Europe and North America - BASF has in-depth expertise in battery chemistry and process technology. We are utilizing these competencies to address battery recycling as an additional growth market in cooperation with partners along the value chain (see page 30). In this way, we want to ensure that valuable metals remain in the production cycle for as long as possible. This conserves resources while enabling production of cathode active materials in Europe with a significantly lower carbon footprint compared with the industrial standard. At the Schwarzheide site in Germany, where a cathode active materials plant is already under construction, we will also build a prototype plant for battery recycling by 2023. The prototype plant will allow for the development of new operating  procedures  and  optimization  of  technology  to  deliver superior recovery rates of lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese from end-of-life lithium-ion batteries. The plant will also recycle",

To achieve this, the initiative offers programs such as training on important environmental, social and governance aspects of responsible mining practices. Since October 2020, 14 mining cooperatives in Kolwezi have participated in training on topics such as occupational safety and environmental management. Cobalt for Development also works closely with local NGOs and the Good Shepherd International Foundation to create additional income opportunities for families and improve access to education. The joint activities are beginning to show results according to an evaluation of the initiative: Participants of the program since its launch have seen an increase in average income and savings. Since construction of the new public primary and secondary schools in Kisote, the majority of children have enrolled in school. Overall, several thousand members of the participating communities are already benefiting. In 2021, the initiative also made an action pledge to eliminate child labor as part of a global campaign by the International Labor Organization (ILO). Three mining cooperatives around Kolwezi are receiving assistance to implement  occupational  safety  measures  and  a  zero-tolerance policy against child labor.\n\nWe signed a long-term supply agreement with Nornickel for nickel and cobalt from a metal refinery in Finland. The agreement ensures locally sourced and secure supply of raw materials for battery material production in Europe. In cooperation with Eramet, we are also assessing the development of a state-of-the-art hydrometallurgical refining complex in Indonesia, which is expected to secure access to more sustainably sourced nickel and cobalt as of the mid-2020s.\n\nWe are also involved in various international initiatives to strengthen sustainability and innovation in the value chain for batteries. These include the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), which we co-founded in 2017. It promotes dialog between business, government and civil society and develops standards and tools to create a socially responsible, ecological and economically sustainable, and innovative value chain for batteries. For instance, BASF is working with the GBA on the GBA Battery Passport. In the future, this 'digital twin' will contain information on the sustainability of a battery to increase transparency in the value chain. The GBA, as well, made an action\n\npledge with the ILO campaign against child labor, also focusing on the Democratic Republic of Congo. BASF is also an active member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative.\n\nFurthermore, together with Daimler, Fairphone, and Volkswagen, we launched the Responsible Lithium Partnership in 2021. It advocates for the responsible use of natural resources in Chile's Salar de Atacama, home to the world's largest lithium reserves and a significant portion of global production. As a first step, the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) was commissioned to organize a local multi-stakeholder platform on the opportunities and risks of lithium mining and other economic activities such as copper mining and tourism. The goal of the platform is to reach a common understanding on the status quo and to jointly develop a vision for the future of the Salar de Atacama watershed. In addition, potential risks are to be mitigated and opportunities promoted through the development and implementation of joint action plans.\n\nAnother mineral raw material that BASF processes is mica . We use both raw mica and effect pigments derived from mica, mainly in the production of coatings. BASF is conscious of its social responsibility with regard to mica sourcing and applies high standards which, among other things, exclude child labor. Suppliers are asked to source mica in accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. As a member of the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI), we advocate for the eradication of child labor and unacceptable working conditions, specifically in India's mica supply chain. The initiative focuses on labor standards, strengthening local communities and legal frameworks. According to an RMI study, activities in the relevant regions of India have already led to improved income and living conditions. These include improved access to clean drinking water through the installation of pumps and filtration systems and improved access to health care through doctors' visits in villages and enrollment in  public health insurance plans.\n\nFor more information on the Cobalt for Development project, see basf.com/cobalt-initiative and\n\ncobalt4development.com/\n\nFor more information on the Global Battery Alliance, see globalbattery.org For more information on the Responsible Mica Initiative, see responsible-mica-initiative.com\n\n<!-- image -->",

We analyze accidents and incidents as well as their causes and consequences in detail at a global level to learn from these. Hazard assessments and the risk minimization measures derived from them are an important prevention tool. We also promote regular dialog across  different  sites  to  strengthen  risk  awareness  among  our employees and contractors, to learn from examples of good practice and in this way, continually develop our safety culture.\n\nLeaders are important role models for employees, which is why environmental protection, health, safety and security are discussed with newly appointed senior executives. Senior executives with a particular responsibility for such topics, for example, in production, also receive specific further training to be able to meet their responsibilities. Due to the restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the seminars for senior executives were held virtually in 2021. Other events and initiatives in 2021 also focused on the high relevance of safety topics and dialog among our leaders. These included regular town halls for senior executives, the Lead with Safety initiative in North America and the Visible Leadership in EHS @ CP initiative in the Petrochemicals division.\n\nNumerous digital solutions and applications are used in BASF's production plants to further increase safety, security, planning capability and availability. For example, we had introduced augmented reality solutions at around 340/uni00A0 plants worldwide as of the end of 2021. We plan to implement these at more than 80 other plants by the end of 2022. At many sites, our employees already use mobile\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nend devices and special apps for day-to-day tasks such as safety inspections, which continuously improves the efficiency and quality of our processes.

We have set ourselves the goal of reducing process safety incidents to a rate of no more than 0.1 per 200,000/uni00A0 working hours by 2025. In 2021, we recorded 0.3/uni00A0process safety incidents per 200,000/uni00A0working hours worldwide (2020: 0.3). We investigate every incident in detail, even under the constraints of the coronavirus pandemic, analyze causes and use the findings to derive suitable measures. We share the findings in our global network in the interest of continuous improvement.\n\nAround the world, we promote the reduction of process safety incidents and improve risk awareness with a culture of dealing openly with mistakes and initiatives to foster dialog around safety risks. To reduce process safety incidents, we focus in particular on technical measures and on a leadership culture that places even greater emphasis on process safety, such as in the PM Global Safety Relay Race initiative in the Performance Materials division. Avoiding and detecting all leaks was again a key priority in 2021 with the Zero Loss of Containment Mindset initiative in North America and the Zero Leakage initiative in South America.\n\nIn addition, we are continually refining and expanding our training methods and offerings to increase risk awareness .

Consequently, a number of criteria crucial to the HPI could not be fully met or measures could not be performed as usual in the reporting year. These included activities that required physical participation such as emergency drills, examinations or first aider training.\n\nIn 2021, 36 work-related illnesses among BASF employees worldwide  were  documented  as  recognized  occupational  diseases (2020 :  26).  The  main  recognized  occupational  diseases  are occupational asthma, hearing loss, skin diseases, musculoskeletal disorders and cancer.\n\nIn 2021, we continued the measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic developed and successfully implemented at our sites in 2020, adapted to the local infection situation in each case. By sharing  information  in  our  BASF  medical  network  and  working closely together with the authorities, employee representatives and our partners at BASF sites, we were able to make and implement sound and timely decisions according to the situation. Our actions focused on the health of all of our employees, contractors and third parties.  Measures  included  providing  information  to  and  raising awareness among employees, tracing and breaking infection chains, and vaccination services. For example, we set up our own coronavirus  vaccination  center  at  our  largest  site  in  Ludwigshafen, Germany. More than 22,000 primary vaccinations and more than 21,000 secondary vaccinations were administered there from April to August 2021, and more than 10,000 booster vaccinations were administered in December to BASF employees, contractors and site partners. Another focus in 2021 was on influenza prevention. BASF employees could be vaccinated against the seasonal flu at many sites around the world, an offer that was very well received. At the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, for example, around 6,800/uni00A0employees participated in the influenza vaccination campaign.\n\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic, the Global Health Campaign 2021 was again devoted to the personal health of our employees. The  program  included  a  wide  range  of  in-person  and  virtual\n\nseminars and interactive events on regeneration under the banner of 'Recharge yourself.' Focus topics were physical activity, nutrition and relaxation. Over 444/uni00A0sites worldwide took part, offering events such as workshops, courses, lectures or exercises.\n\nIn October 2021, BASF/uni00A0 SE's Corporate Health Management unit received the European Responsible Care \u00ae Award from the European Chemical  Industry  Council  (CEFIC)  in  the  category  'Supporting health in COVID-19 times' for its wide-ranging activities and innovative  approaches  to  fight  the  coronavirus  pandemic  -  bundled under the motto of 'Protect yourself and others.'\n\n- For more information on occupational medicine, health campaigns and the HPI, see basf.com/health\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Emergency response, corporate and cyber security\n\nWe create working conditions and an environment in which our employees can work safely. The focus of our emergency and crisis management is therefore on the safety of our employees, plants and sites as well as our communities. We are well prepared at global, regional and local level for exceptional situations such as major incidents or pandemics thanks to our extensive regulations and measures for emergency preparedness, emergency response and crisis management. All incidents are carefully followed up on to identify potential for improvement, which is integrated into existing concepts as needed. Unusual incidents are recorded and reported centrally  in  accordance  with  a  standard  Group-wide  procedure (e-Rapid Incident Report). This enables us to identify risks at an early stage and, if necessary, initiate appropriate relief and communication measures.\n\nIncidents are initially handled by the local crisis organization or local emergency response team. We have implemented precautionary organizational measures with clearly defined responsibilities and procedures at all sites for this purpose. The responsible persons receive regular training. Depending on the situation, we also involve business  partners  and  our  sites'  communities,  such  as  local\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nauthorities or neighboring companies. Additional teams may be called  in  depending  on  the  extent  of  the  damage  and  how it develops.\n\nFor example, the Global Crisis Management Support Team (GCMS), led by a member of the Board of Executive Directors, was activated in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. It provides the strategic direction for crisis management and is supported by issuespecific and specialist working groups.\n\nSafety and emergency drills are also conducted regularly at site and Group level. The number of employees and partners involved varies depending on the type of exercise.\n\nWe are actively involved in external networks, which quickly provide information and assistance in emergencies. These include the International Chemical and Environmental (ICE) initiative and the German Transport Accident Information and Emergency Response System (TUIS), in which BASF plays a coordinating role. In 2021, we provided assistance to public emergency response agencies and other companies in 138 cases (2020: 112). This included information on chemicals and their proper disposal, on-site operational support for transportation accidents involving hazardous goods, or information on human biomonitoring. We apply the experience we have gathered to improve our own processes and set up similar systems in other countries.\n\nThe corporate security requirements for site security are set out in a global guideline. Local implementation by our sites and subsidiaries is regularly audited and continuously improved. Respect for human rights is a mandatory element of our requirements. Aspects of human rights relevant to site security are a component of the global code of conduct and qualification requirements for our internal and external security personnel. We analyze the potential safety and security risks associated with investment projects and strategic plans, and define appropriate safety and security concepts. Our",

We updated our travel recommendations in line with the coronavirus pandemic. After any major incident, we can use a standardized global travel system to locate and contact employees in the affected regions.\n\nWe protect our employees, sites, plants and company know-how against third-party interference. This includes addressing in depth the  issue  of cybersecurity  and  information  security .  BASF applies the 'security by design' principle to critically review and optimize IT applications from a cybersecurity perspective as early as the design phase. We are continually improving our ability to prevent, detect and react to security incidents with various measures and training programs. Our global cybersecurity team monitors and protects our IT systems against hacker attacks. We cooperate with experts and partners in a global network to ensure that we can protect ourselves against cyberattacks as far as possible. Our IT security  management  system  is  certified  according  to  DIN  EN ISO / IEC 27001:2017. It also supports, in particular, our critical infrastructures in meeting additional compliance requirements such as DIN EN ISO/IEC 27019:2020, IT security catalog and corresponding industry-specific standards (B3S).\n\nAround the world, we work to sensitize our employees about protecting information and know-how. We further strengthened our employees' awareness of risks in 2021 with mandatory, regular online training for all employees and complementary offerings such as seminars, case studies and interactive training. These increasingly addressed aspects of working practices that have changed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, such as cybersecurity when working from home.\n\nOur worldwide network of information protection officers comprises around 650/uni00A0 employees. They support the implementation of our uniform requirements and hold events and seminars on secure behaviors. Around 100,000/uni00A0 employees had been trained on the basics of cybersecurity and information protection in 2021. Our standardized Group-wide recommendations for the protection of information and knowledge were expanded to include additional guidance  for  employees  and  updated  in  line  with  current developments.\n\n- For more information on emergency response, see basf.com/emergency\\_response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Automation Security Roadmap\n\nThe advance of digitalization increases the risk of cyberattacks on IT systems such as online stores or servers. At the same time, automation technology (operational technology) is increasingly being used in production plants, buildings, laboratories and in logistics, which is also connected to the internet via various protection levels. An interdisciplinary team with experts from information and automation technology developed the Automation Security Roadmap to reduce risk in these areas. It serves as a guide for facilities to protect themselves against cyberattacks. Part of the concept is training Officers for Automation Security (OAS). BASF now has over 300 OASs. They provide advice and support on cybersecurity in automation technology at all BASF sites worldwide - for example, on risk analysis, protecting sensitive data and access control.",

We continuously work to ensure that our products pose no risk to people or the environment when they are used responsibly and in the manner intended. We aim to comply with all relevant national and international laws and regulations.\n\n## Strategy\n\nWe are committed to continuously minimizing the negative effects of our products on the environment, health and safety and to the ongoing optimization of our products. This commitment to product safety is enshrined in our Responsible Care \u00ae charter and the initiatives of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). Our products should not pose any risk to humans or the environment when used responsibly and in the manner intended. We aim to comply with all relevant national and international laws and regulations.  Our global  requirements define  rules,  processes  and responsibilities, for example, to ensure uniformly high product safety standards worldwide. Our sites and subsidiaries are responsible for implementing  and  complying  with  internal  guidelines  and  legal requirements. The Environmental Protection, Health/uni00A0& Safety unit in the  Corporate  Center  conducts  regular  audits  to  monitor  this. BASF's global network of experts shares information, insights and best practices around product safety on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe maintain and evaluate environmental, health and safety data for all of our substances and products in a global database . This information is continuously updated. The database forms the basis for substance and product assessments and for our safety data sheets, which we make available to our customers in around 40/uni00A0languages. These include information on the physical/chemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties of products, potential hazards, first\n\naid measures, measures to be taken in the case of accidental release,  and  disposal.  Our  global  emergency  hotline  network enables us to provide information around the clock. In order to help users to quickly find out about our products and the risks associated with them, we use the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) to  classify and label our products around the world, provided this is legally permissible in the country concerned. We take into account any national or regional modifications within the GHS framework, such as the E.U.'s CLP Regulation.\n\nWe train our employees, customers and logistics partners worldwide on the proper handling and optimal use of selected products with particular hazard potential. Furthermore, in associations and together with other manufacturers, BASF is pushing for the establishment of voluntary global commitments to prevent the misuse of chemicals.\n\n## Global chemicals regulations\n\nMost of the products we manufacture are subject to statutory chemicals regulations. We want to ensure compliance with these. We are bound by the relevant regional and national chemicals regulations, which continue to grow in number worldwide. Examples include REACH in the E.U., TSCA in the United States and KKDIK in Turkey. BASF Group companies work closely together with a global network of experts to ensure that BASF complies with the applicable regulations.\n\n## Environmental and toxicological testing\n\nBefore launching products on the market, we subject them to a variety of environmental and toxicological tests using state-of-theart knowledge and technology. If we employ animal studies, we adhere  to  the  specifications  laid  down  by  the  German  Animal Welfare Act as well as the requirements of the Association for Assessment  and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care - the highest standard for laboratory animals in the world. We develop\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand are  continuously optimizing alternative methods to experimentally assess the  safety and tolerance of our products without animal studies. Our aim is to replace, reduce and refine animal studies to minimize the  impact on them. We made great progress toward this goal in 2021. For example, an animal-free toxicological testing  strategy  jointly   developed  by  BASF  and  Givaudan  was approved by the OECD - the first of its kind worldwide. The strategy comprises three individual alternative methods. By combining these methods, it is possible to test more precisely than in animal studies whether a substance causes allergic skin reactions.\n\n## Management of nano- and biotechnology\n\nNanotechnology and biotechnology offer solutions for key societal challenges - such as environmental and climate protection or health and nutrition. For example, nanomaterials can improve battery performance and biocatalytic methods can improve process resource efficiency. We want to harness the potential of both technologies. Using them safely and responsibly is our top priority. Safe handling of nanomaterials is stipulated in our Nanotechnology Code of Conduct, for instance. We produce a range of products with the help of biotechnological methods, including natural fragrances and flavors, enzymes, vitamins or seeds for agriculture. This provides us with extensive experience in their safe use in research, development and production. We are guided by the code of conduct set out by EuropaBio, the European biotechnology association, and want to adhere to all relevant standards and legal regulations governing production and marketing in our use of biotechnology.",

Regulatory approval is only granted when extensive documentation can be provided showing that our products are safe for people,  animals and the environment when used in the manner intended.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA High regulatory requirements and safety standards for crop protection products and seeds\n- /uni25AA Wide range of training on the safe and proper handling of our products\n\nPotential risks are assessed and minimized throughout the research, development and registration process, and on an ongoing basis following market registration. We regularly perform a large number of scientific studies and tests to ensure that, as far as possible, our registration dossiers address all questions on potential environmental and health effects.\n\nWe adapt our portfolio to the specific requirements of regional markets as crops, soils, climate conditions, plant diseases and farming practices vary around the world. Consequently, product approvals differ from country to country.\n\n## Crop protection\n\nBASF adheres to the International Code of Conduct issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the distribution of crop protection products. These are only marketed once they have been approved by the relevant authorities. We no longer sell WHO Class 1A or 1B products (high acute oral and dermal toxicity). Depending on availability, we offer our customers alternatives.\n\nAll of BASF's crop protection products can be used safely under local farming conditions if the information and directions on the label are followed. Customers can contact us directly if they have any questions, complaints or issues, for example, by calling the telephone number printed on product labels, using the contact forms on our websites or by approaching our sales employees directly. We record all products incidents relating to health or the environment that come to our attention in a global database. If necessary, we take appropriate measures on the basis of this information, such as updating the instructions for use on the product label to minimize preventable incidents in the future. We communicate changes to instructions for use and general recommendations on the safe use of our products through channels such as our Farmer Field School initiatives in Asia and in training programs such as the On Target Application Academy in the United States.\n\nOne of the ways we meet our commitment to product stewardship is by offering a wide range of courses and training on the safe storage and safe use of our products. In India, for example, BASF launched  the  Suraksha  Hamesha  program.  Suraksha  Hamesha means 'safety all the time.' The program creates a platform for educating farmers and agricultural workers about the nine steps of responsible use of crop protection products and personal protection. Through Suraksha Hamesha, BASF has engaged with over 162,600 agricultural workers and around 33,200 users across India since 2016. BASF also involves government agencies and the central government's farm extension teams in these meetings to support and promote farm safety.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also work closely together with associations such as CropLife International and CropLife Europe to promote the safe and proper use of crop protection products. For example, we support stewardship initiatives of both associations and various programs on the proper disposal and recycling of product containers. Technological innovations developed together with industry partners such as the easyconnect closed transfer system in Europe or the Wisdom system in South America also help to make using crop protection products easier and safer.\n\n## Seeds\n\nBASF is a member of Excellence Through Stewardship, a global industry initiative for seeds. This initiative promotes the adoption of quality management systems for seeds and product stewardship programs covering the entire life cycle. It also has independent ETS-certified auditors verify members' compliance with its guidelines. In 2021, BASF successfully passed ETS audits in the areas of laboratory operations, contained biotech plants, general stewardship, incident response management and product handling at our Ghent and Astene sites in Belgium.\n\n- For more information on our Agricultural Solutions segment, see page 88 onward\n\nFor more information on biodiversity, see page 138 onward\n\nFor more information on risks from litigation and claims, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 262",

This is why we depend on global standards, an effective organization and reliable logistics partners. Our goal is to minimize risks along the entire transportation chain - from loading and transportation to unloading. The transportation of dangerous goods is subject to mandatory national and international dangerous goods regulations as well as our global guidelines. The sites and subsidiaries are responsible for implementing transportation safety regulations  and  guidelines.  Compliance  is  regularly  monitored  by  the Environmental Protection, Health/uni00A0 & Safety unit in the Corporate Center using globally standardized transportation safety reviews.\n\nExternal logistics partners are evaluated based risk either through assessments or on-site audits. BASF's global network of experts ensures that information, insights and best practices are shared on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Preventive safety measures\n\nNational and international dangerous goods regulations are based on an assessment of transportation risks and set out rules and measures for safely transporting dangerous goods. We use various tools to minimize transportation risks. For example, for every dangerous good to be transported, we check in each case whether the packaging is suitable for the type of transport. We conduct digital dangerous goods checks before shipping orders are released. In addition, vehicles are subjected to a thorough dangerous goods check prior to loading and rejected if there are any issues.\n\nAbove and beyond this, we use our global requirement to specifically assess the safety and environmental risks of transporting and handling raw materials and sales products with high hazard potential. This is based on the Guidance on Safety Risk Assessment for  Chemical  Transport  Operations  published  by  the  European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC).\n\nWe stipulate worldwide requirements for our logistics service providers and assess them in terms of safety and quality. Our experts use our own evaluation and monitoring tools as well as internationally approved schemes such as the ship inspection reports issued by the Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) and the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF).\n\n- 1 Data is collected based on the International Council of Chemical Association's (ICCA) guidance for reporting performance and includes road, rail and container shipping incidents.\n- 2 Hazardous goods are classified in accordance with national and international hazardous goods regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transportation incidents\n\nTo evaluate transportation safety, we systematically record transporta tion incidents according to defined criteria. We use the number of transportation incidents 1 as a reporting indicator. In 2021, we recorded 21 transportation incidents worldwide (2020: 19).\n\nA particular focus is incidents involving goods spillages that could lead to significant environmental impacts. These include dangerous goods leaks of BASF products in excess of 200 kilograms on public traffic routes, provided BASF arranged the transport. We recorded three incidents in 2021 with spillage of more than 200/uni00A0kilograms of dangerous goods 2 (2020: 2). None of these transportation incidents had a significant impact on the environment (2020: 0).\n\nFor more information on transportation safety, see basf.com/distribution\\_safety\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are committed to the Paris Climate Agreement. Our inno va tive products enable a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in many areas. At the same time, we are working to significantly  reduce our own carbon footprint with our carbon   management.\n\n## At a glance\n\n## 20.2 million metric  tons\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions in 2021\n\n## 2.4/uni00A0TWh\n\nRenewable\n\nenergy\n\n- /uni25AA Even more ambitious emission reduction targets\n- /uni25AA New Net Zero Accelerator unit bundles and accelerates projects to achieve targets\n- /uni25AA Corporate and product carbon footprints create transparency\n- /uni25AA Supplier CO2 Management Program\n\n## Strategy\n\nClimate protection is very important to us and is an important part of our corporate strategy. We significantly raised our climate protection targets in 2021: As a leading chemical company, we want to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions 1 from our production sites and our energy purchases by 25% by 2030 compared with 2018 despite targeted growth and the construction of a large Verbund site in southern China. 2 By 2050, we aim to achieve net zero emissions from our production sites and our energy purchases.\n\n## Schematic overview: development of the BASF Group's greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\nMillion metric tons of CO2 equivalents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have bundled our global activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our carbon management (see 'Global targets and measures'). We only consider external offsetting measures as a temporary stop-gap if our activities do not make the desired contribution to reducing emissions. By 2025, we plan to invest up to \u20ac1/uni00A0billion to achieve our climate protection targets. Additional investments of up to \u20ac3/uni00A0billion are to follow by 2030.\n\nOur new  organizational  structure aims  to  drive  forward  our climate protection targets and carbon management activities with even greater focus and speed: The Corporate Strategy/uni00A0& Sustainability unit in the Corporate Center will continue to develop targets and track global target achievement, while the Net Zero Accelerator unit, which was launched at the beginning of 2022, will focus on accelerating the implementation of existing and new cross -company projects  to  reduce  emissions.  The  emphasis  is  on  low-carbon production technologies (see page/uni00A0132), the circular economy (see page 44) and renewable energies (see page 128). Both units report directly to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors. This\n\nensures that climate protection-relevant aspects are integrated into strategic decision-making processes as well as into core business activities (see page 46). In parallel, our operating divisions are working on division-specific projects to reduce emissions,  supported by the global service units.\n\nWe consistently align our actions with our climate protection targets, based on a comprehensive analysis of our emissions. Group-wide CO2 emissions are anchored in the BASF/uni00A0 Group's steering and compensation systems as a most important nonfinancial key performance indicator, giving them even more weight. Investments and acquisitions are assessed with regard to their impact on our climate protection targets.\n\nWe are gradually integrating our suppliers into the management of greenhouse gas emissions along the value chain. To this end, we launched our Supplier CO2 Management Program in 2021 (see page 130).\n\n- 1 The goal includes greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e).\n- 2 In March 2021, we replaced our previous target of CO2-neutral growth until 2030 (baseline 2018: 21.9/uni00A0million metric tons of CO2e) with a new, more ambitious climate protection target to reduce absolute CO2 emissions by 25% compared with 2018 (new target: 16.4/uni00A0million metric tons of CO2e).\n\n<!-- image -->",

More than 60%  of  our  annual  research  and  development  spending 1 goes toward developing these products, optimizing our processes, and toward research projects to make our processes more energy and resource-efficient and to prevent greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe continuously analyze potential risks to our business operations arising in connection with the topics of energy and climate  protection and derive appropriate measures. We support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Since the 2019 reporting year, BASF's annual report has included an overview showing the sections and subsections in which TCFD-relevant information can be found (see page 19). We also participate in the program established by the international nonprofit organization CDP for reporting on data relevant to climate protection and have done so since 2004. BASF achieved a score of A- in CDP's 2021 climate change questionnaire, again attaining Leadership status. Companies on the Leadership level are distinguished by factors such as the completeness and transparency of their  reporting.  They  also  pursue  comprehensive  approaches  in managing the opportunities and risks associated with climate change as well as strategies to achieve company-wide emission reduction goals.\n\nWe report on greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as well as the sector-specific standard for the chemical industry.\n\nClimate protection is a shared task.

This corresponds to a reduction of around 60% compared with 1990. Our long-term goal is net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (Scope/uni00A01 and 2).\n\n## 2030 and 2050 targets\n\n## -25%\n\nReduction in our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 2018 a (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n## Net zero\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 a (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n- a BASF operations excluding sale of energy to third parties, including offsetting\n\nThe BASF/uni00A0Group's emissions reported under these targets in 2021 amounted to 20.2/uni00A0 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2020: 20.8/uni00A0million metric tons of CO2 equivalents). We were able to reduce emissions by around 3% year on year despite significantly higher production volumes due to the increased use of renewable energy and measures to improve energy efficiency and optimize processes. Lower ammonia production due to the high price of natural gas also reduced emissions.\n\nTo achieve our ambitious climate protection goals, we have adopted comprehensive  carbon  management.  This  has five  levers  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions : Using renewable energies for both electricity and steam production (gray-to-green and powerto- steam levers), developing and applying new carbon-free and low-carbon production processes (new technologies lever, see page/uni00A0 132), using alternative raw materials (bio-based feedstocks\n\n## Energy supply of the BASF/uni00A0Group 2021\n\n## Electricity supply a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a Adjusted method for recognizing import/export of electricity and steam\n- b Conversion factor: 0.75 MWh per metric ton of steam\n\nlever),  and  ongoing  measures  to  further  increase  energy  and resource efficiency in our production (continuous opex lever).\n\n- For more information on climate protection, see page 27\n\nA projection of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 can be found in the forecast from page 148 onward\n\n## Energy supply\n\nOur total energy consumption, comprising fuel demand in our own central power and steam generation plants, primary energy requirements in our process plants, and net power and steam imports, was 58.8/uni00A0million MWh in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFossil fuels and residual fuels used in the BASF Group's central power and steam generation plants\n\nNatural gas\n\n30.9 million MWh\n\n80.3%\n\nHeating oil\n\n0.1 million MWh\n\n0.2%\n\nCoal\n\n0.8 million MWh\n\n2.1%\n\nSubstitute fuels\n\n6.7 million MWh\n\n17.4%\n\n38.5 million MWh\n\nTotal:\n\nTo generate our own steam and power , we mainly use natural gas (80.3%) and substitute fuels (17.4%).

We cover more than 58% of our electricity demand with our own gas and steam turbines in highly efficient combined heat and power plants. To achieve the highest possible energy yield with the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions, we con tinu ously invest in our combined heat and power plants. One example is our gas and steam turbine power plant at the Schwarzheide site in Germany, which is undergoing a \u20ac73/uni00A0million modernization. Once it is started up in 2022, it will produce 10% more electricity and the CO2 emissions factor of the power generated will be around 10% lower thanks to higher fuel efficiency.",

In 2021, internally generated power in the BASF/uni00A0Group had a carbon footprint of around 0.24/uni00A0 metric tons of CO2 per MWh of electricity and was below the national grid factor at most BASF/uni00A0Group locations.\n\nAnother important component of carbon-optimized energy supply at our sites is the Verbund system . It helps us realize synergies and manage  value  chains  in  a  resource-efficient  way.  For  example, waste heat from one plant's production process is used as energy in other plants. The Verbund saved us around 21.4/uni00A0 million MWh in 2021, which translates to 4.3/uni00A0million metric tons less CO2 released into the environment. With combined power and steam generation as well as our optimized Energy Verbund, we were thus able to avoid a total of 7.3/uni00A0million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2021. That is why we will continue to invest in the creation and optimization of Verbund structures and drive forward the consolidation of production at highly efficient sites.\n\nA central component of reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of our carbon management is gradually shifting our energy supply to renewable sources . This applies to both our electricity and steam supply and our production processes, where we will increasingly replace fossil fuels with energy from renewable sources. The electrification of our processes will significantly increase the BASF/uni00A0 Group's green power demand over the coming years (see page/uni00A027).\n\nTo ensure access to energy from renewable sources, we are pursuing a make and buy approach . Firstly, BASF is investing in its own renewable power assets, particularly offshore wind farms. Secondly, BASF will purchase green power on the market through long-term supply agreements with plant operators, green power agreements or renewable energy certificates, depending on the region and market regulations. A key purchasing criterion is the 'additionality' of the energy purchased. This means that power is primarily generated by new wind and solar farms.\n\nIn 2021, we entered into pioneering cooperative agreements to transform our energy supply. For instance, we currently hold a 49.5% share in Vattenfall's Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ) offshore wind farm. Pending approval of the relevant merger control authorities, we plan to sell shares in HKZ to Allianz Capital Partners in the first quarter of 2022. This will reduce our interest to 24.3%. The  originally agreed power purchase volumes remain unaffected by the transaction on the basis of a long-term fixed-price power purchasing agreement. Once fully operational, expected in 2023, HKZ will have a total capacity of 1.5/uni00A0gigawatts. We will use part of the electricity generated  there  at  the  Verbund  site  in  Antwerp  and  at  other European production sites. Under a letter of intent, together with RWE we are developing a project concept for an offshore wind farm in the German North Sea with a capacity of 2/uni00A0gigawatts. Provided the regulatory framework is adapted by the authorities, this wind farm could supply the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, with green electricity before 2030. Together with enviaM, we are also planning to build and operate a solar park with a total installed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncapacity of 24/uni00A0megawatts peak (MWp) to supply the Schwarzheide site in Germany.\n\nIn addition to these cooperative ventures, in 2021 we concluded further long-term supply agreements for green power. In Europe, these include a power purchase agreement for wind energy with the Engie group (volume: up to 20.7/uni00A0TWh / term: 25/uni00A0years) and an offshore  wind  power  purchase  agreement  with  \u00d8rsted  (installed capacity: 186/uni00A0MW / term: 25/uni00A0years). We will procure energy for our new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, from a wind and solar park with a capacity of 400/uni00A0megawatts. Further long-term supply agreements for wind and solar power were concluded in the United States for the Freeport and Pasadena sites (both in Texas).\n\nIn addition, we have converted existing agreements to green power and have acquired renewable energy certificates in a number of regions. The aim is to gradually replace these temporary measures with our own power assets or long-term supply agreements.\n\nIn total, over 88/uni00A0sites worldwide (2020: 19) were already partially or fully powered by emission-free electricity at the end of 2021. The carbon  footprint  of  purchased  electricity  in  2021  was  around 0.21/uni00A0metric tons of CO2/MWh (market-based approach),  significantly lower than in the previous year (0.41/uni00A0metric tons CO2/MWh).",

        "page_content": "## Specific greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency\n\nEnergy use and greenhouse gas emissions are closely linked to capacity utilization and production volumes at our plants. Specific greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 amounted to 0.564/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 equivalents per metric ton of sales product, 1 a decrease of 11.7% compared with the previous year (2020: 0.639/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 equivalents per metric ton of sales product). This was mainly due to higher demand compared with the previous year and consequently, better and more stable capacity utilization at our plants. In addition, the increased use of renewable energy had a positive impact on specific greenhouse gas emissions. Since 1990, we have been able to lower our overall greenhouse gas emissions from BASF operations by 49.7% and even reduce specific emissions by 75.4%.\n\nAs part of our carbon management, we aim to make our plants and processes even more efficient and resource saving. An important component of this is the introduction and ongoing maintenance of certified energy management systems according to DIN/uni00A0EN/uni00A0ISO 50001 at all relevant production sites. 2 These help us to identify and implement further potential for improvement in energy efficiency. This not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions and saves valuable energy resources but also increases our competitiveness. In 2021, 76 production sites worldwide had certified energy management systems, representing 90% of our primary energy demand.\n\nA global working group provides ongoing support to the sites and Group companies in implementing and maintaining certified energy management systems. All energy efficiency measures are recorded in a global database, analyzed and made available to BASF sites as best practices.\n\n- 1 Sales product volumes include sales between BASF/uni00A0Group companies; merchandise is not taken into account.\n- 2 Relevant sites are selected based on the amount of primary energy used and local energy prices.\n- 3 Calculated in accordance with internationally recognized rules, including the use of values from general databases and industry averages.\n\n## Certified energy management systems (ISO/uni00A050001) at BASF/uni00A0Group sites worldwide, in terms of primary energy demand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are currently pursuing more than 250 technical and organizational measures to reduce energy consumption and increase competitiveness. Our employees are an important source of  optimization ideas in this regard. For instance, suggestions for  improvement submitted  by  our  employees  in  2021  enabled  us  to  avoid  around 12,000/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 at the Ludwigshafen site in  Germany alone.\n\nWe further improved energy and resource consumption in production with numerous projects around the world in 2021. At the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, for example, a multi-stage evaporation system set up at one plant saves over 60,000/uni00A0metric tons of steam per  year.  At  another  plant,  additional  heat  integration  made  it possible to supply other users with higher-pressure steam, reducing fuel consumption on the power plant side. At the Shanghai-Caojing site  in  China,  a  modernized  control  concept  reduced  the  fuel demand of a heat recovery unit, and at another plant, steam  demand was reduced by additional heat integration using a cooler. At the Geismar Verbund site in Louisiana, steam demand was reduced by the use of optimized condensate separators. In total, these measures save more than 23,000/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 annually. We also achieved additional savings in steam, electricity and fuel through process improvements at many other sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Carbon footprint, product carbon footprint and climate protection  products\n\nBASF has published a comprehensive corporate carbon footprint every year since 2008. This reports on all emissions along the value chain - from raw materials extraction to production and disposal.\n\nThe Scope/uni00A0 3 greenhouse gas emissions arising before and after BASF's activities in the value chain (in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol's definition) were determined as around 101/uni00A0million metric tons of CO2 equivalents for 2021 (2020: 92/uni00A0million metric tons of CO2 equivalents). 3 We are continually working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our business activities - in our own production and, together with our partners, along the value chain.\n\nBASF  was  able  to  reduce  emissions  in  the  Scope/uni00A0 3  category 'customers' by 2/uni00A0million metric tons in 2021, primarily through the use of new blowing agents in polyurethane (PU) foams. Until now, the main blowing agents used were hydrofluorocarbons. These are used in the production of PU insulation materials to create foams with excellent insulation properties. The use of these hydrofluorocarbons in PU products will be prohibited in the European Union from  2023  due  to  their  high  climate  impact.  We  are  therefore gradually replacing them with hydrofluoroolefins, which have a much lower climate impact (measured by global warming potential, GWP). BASF began rolling out PU spray foams based on this new generation of blowing agents on the European market back in 2017. By the end of 2021, we will have almost completely converted our  European PU spray foam production and will continue to systematically drive this forward in other regions as well.\n\nOur climate protection products offer our customers solutions to avoid greenhouse gas emissions over their entire life cycle compared with reference products.

We currently use industrial averages and values from commercial databases as the basis for calculating these upstream emissions.\n\nIn 2021, we introduced a global Supplier CO2 Management Program to create transparency and better steer and, in the long term, reduce upstream emissions. In a first step, we ask our suppliers to provide PCFs for our raw materials. We support them by sharing our knowledge of evaluation and calculation methods. In this way, we are also contributing to the standardization of PCF calculation. In a second step, we want to work with our suppliers on solutions to reduce product-related emissions and establish the PCF as a criterion for our purchasing decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our emissions reporting, see basf.com/corporate\\_carbon\\_footprint For more information on Product Carbon Footprints, see basf.com/pcf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Product Carbon Footprint\n\nWe use an in-house digital solution to calculate the carbon footprint of our products (PCF). In 2021, this was recognized by organizations such as the German chemical industry association (VCI) with the Responsible Care Award for digitalization. The methodology follows general standards for life  cycle analysis such as ISO 14044 and ISO 14067, as well as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Product Standard, and has been certified by T\u00dcV Rheinland.\n\nWe  used  the  new  method  to  calculate  PCFs  for  around 45,000/uni00A0sales products in 2021. The transparency this creates enables us to target our CO2 reduction measures to those areas where our customers can later achieve the greatest value added from lower carbon emissions in the value chain. In 2021, we were able to offer the first products with a certified reduced carbon footprint through the use of renewable  energy.\n\nWe  also  started  to  make  the  automated  PCF  calculation approach available to interested industry players by way of partnerships. In a first step, IT companies will be able to translate BASF's methodology and in-house solution into a marketable software through licensing agreements.",

BASF is  developing a process - methane pyrolysis - that significantly reduces carbon emissions in the production of hydrogen. Find out more about what drives project manager Dieter Flick and which groundbreaking technologies are still being researched in the online report at report.basf.com.\n\n## In focus:\n\n## Innovative Processes for Climate-Smart Chemistry\n\nMost of our production processes are already highly optimized. This makes it increasingly difficult to implement further improvements to reduce CO2. Completely new technologies are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the long term and on a large scale. Different teams are working on this in our Carbon Management R&D Program.\n\nOur focus here is on the production of basic chemicals such as hydrogen. The element is needed as a reaction partner in many processes. The processes currently used to produce hydrogen, such as steam reforming, produce high levels of CO2 emissions. That is why BASF is open to different technologies and is driving forward two alternative processes for climate-smart hydrogen production: water electrolysis and methane pyrolysis. In water electrolysis , water is split directly into its two components, hydrogen and oxygen. If the required energy comes from renewable sources, the process is carbon-free. We intend to use the hydrogen generated by water electrolysis primarily as a material in the BASF Verbund and also, to a limited extent, for hydrogen model region projects in Germany's Rhine-Neckar region. We are currently working with Siemens Energy on initial concepts for the construction of a PEM (proton exchange membrane) water electrolyzer with a capacity of 50 megawatts at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany. We are also exploring various options for project funding.\n\nIn  parallel,  we  are  developing methane  pyrolysis technology together with partners from academia and industry in a project sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. In this innovative process, (bio)methane is split directly into hydrogen and solid carbon. The process requires around 80% less electricity than water electrolysis and is virtually carbon-free if renewable energy is used. Following extensive groundwork, we started up a test plant for methane pyrolysis at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany in 2021.\n\nIt will provide insights into the heating concept, as well as the use of new types of materials.\n\nAnother focus area is alternative heating concepts for our steam cracker furnaces (see page 72). We use these plants to split petroleum into olefins and aromatics. This requires temperatures of around 850 degrees Celsius, which are normally achieved by burning fossil fuels - which emits high levels of CO2. A fundamentally new heating concept based on electric resistance heating ( eFurnace) and the use of renewable energy could eliminate up to 90% of processrelated emissions in the future. To develop and pilot the concept, we signed a cooperation agreement with SABIC and Linde in 2021 and jointly applied for funding to build a demonstration plant.\n\nIn addition to new, low-carbon production processes, we are also investigating the use of innovative carbon storage methods . At the Antwerp site in Belgium, BASF plans to invest in one of the largest carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects under the North Sea together with its Antwerp@C consortium partners. The project can potentially avoid more than one million metric tons of CO2 emissions per year from the production of basic chemicals. A final investment decision is targeted for 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our plants are operated safely and efficiently. We use resources responsibly and are continually reducing the environmental impact of our plants and processes with our Operational Excellence Program.\n\n## At a glance\n\n## 26,358/uni00A0metric tons\n\nAir pollutants from BASF operations\n\n47.0%\n\nShare of our waste recycled or thermally recovered\n\n- /uni25AA Improvements based on continuous monitoring of emissions to air and waste streams\n- /uni25AA Circular concepts an important part of our activities\n- /uni25AA Systematic management of contaminated sites\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of our plants and the responsible management of resources and waste are core components of our Responsible Care Management system. We have defined our global standards for emissions to air, waste and contaminated sites in Group-wide guidelines, the implementation of which is the responsibility of the sites and subsidiaries. The Environmental Protection, Health/uni00A0 & Safety unit in the Corporate Center conducts regular audits to monitor compliance with legal requirements and internal\n\nguidelines. BASF's global network of experts regularly shares information, insights and best practices to further reduce our emissions to air, manage waste and responsibly handle contaminated sites.\n\nContinuous documentation and monitoring of emissions to air, waste streams and contaminated sites as well as the implementation of measures for improvement are an integral part of our environmental management. In addition to greenhouse gases (see page 126 onward), we also measure and analyze emissions of air pol lutants to avoid potentially harmful substances as best possible.\n\nOur waste management is based on the systematic tracking of material flows and follows a clear hierarchy: We aim to avoid waste as far as possible, for example, by continuously optimizing our processes or developing new production methods. BASF's Verbund structure with its networked plants and value chains is key here. We use it to efficiently manage our material flows. The by-products of one plant serve as feedstock for other plants and processes elsewhere in the BASF/uni00A0Verbund, avoiding waste and enabling us to use raw materials as efficiently as possible.\n\nIf these cannot be used within BASF's Verbund structures, we assess whether they can be recycled or thermally recovered. Nonrecyclable materials are disposed of safely, appropriately and in an environmentally responsible manner. If we use external waste disposal companies, we conduct regular audits to ensure that waste is disposed of properly. In this way, we also contribute to preventive soil protection and keep today's waste from becoming tomorrow's contamination. If soil and groundwater contamination occurs at  active or former sites, appropriate remediation measures are  reviewed and implemented.\n\nIn addition to optimizing our own processes, we are committed to reducing the impact on air and soil and minimizing our disposal volumes and material consumption along our value chains . We expect our suppliers to comply with internationally recognized environmental standards. This is assessed as part of our sustainable\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsupply chain management. We support our suppliers in developing and implementing measures for improvement, for example in waste management (see page 111). We offer our customers a wide range of products that can reduce air pollutants or waste - from industrial process catalysts, fuel additives and catalysts for the automotive sector to additives and track-and-trace technologies to extend the useful life of plastics or improve mechanical recycling of plastic waste.\n\nWe are increasingly aligning our actions with the circular economy principle . For example, we are increasingly using recycled and waste-based raw materials in our production, recycling operating supplies,  and  expanding  our  capacities  for  recovering  precious metals from spent automotive and industrial catalysts. We are also developing product-specific recycling technologies, often together with partners along our value chains. For instance, we are driving forward the chemical recycling of mixed plastic waste and disposed foam mattresses and are working on new concepts for recycling battery materials. We are also involved in cross-industry networks and initiatives to avoid waste and strengthen the circular economy. These include the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (see box on page/uni00A0134) and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Emissions of ozone-depleting substances as defined by the Montreal Protocol totaled 17/uni00A0metric tons in 2021 (2020: 14/uni00A0metric tons). We significantly reduced these emissions compared with 2002 (229/uni00A0metric tons) by successively shifting to alternative coolants.

For instance, we use catalysts to reduce nitrogen oxides or feed waste gases back into the production process. One example is the nitrous oxide generated in the production of adipic acid at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany: 99% of this by-product is already decomposed or used in the BASF/uni00A0Verbund. In the future, it will even be 99.9%. This will  be  made  possible  by  an  automation  project  implemented in 2021 to optimally control processes based on important plant parameters and using predictive model calculations. The aim is to avoid around 550/uni00A0metric tons of nitrous oxide emissions annually, corresponding to around 145,000/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 equivalents.\n\nBASF generated 2.47/uni00A0million metric tons of waste in 2021 (2020: 2.21/uni00A0million metric tons). Of this, 53.0% was disposed of. Hazardous waste accounted for 73.9% of the total disposed waste (2020: 69.6%). Based on the concept of the circular economy, we are continuously examining options for material or thermal recycling for all waste (see 'Strategy'). In this way, we were able to find new uses for 47.0% of our waste in 2021. We continuously identify and evaluate the safest and most environmentally sound disposal routes for non-recyclable waste. In 2021, most of our hazardous waste was incinerated (77.7%), where possible with energy recovery. 7.6% of hazardous waste was disposed of in landfill. This is mainly contaminated construction waste that cannot be reused or recycled due to legal requirements.\n\n## Waste generation in the BASF/uni00A0Group\n\nMillion metric tons\n\n|                                                  |   Hazardous   waste a |   Hazardous   waste a |   Nonhazardous  waste a |   Nonhazardous  waste a |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                  |               2021    |               2020    |                 2021    |                 2020    |\n| Recycled                                         |                  0.14 |                  0.13 |                    0.37 |                    0.31 |\n| Thermally recovered                              |                  0.52 |                  0.43 |                    0.13 |                    0.09 |\n| Waste recovered                                  |                  0.66 |                  0.56 |                    0.5  |                    0.4  |\n| Through incineration   (without energy recovery) |                  0.75 |                  0.64 |                    0.1  |                    0.1  |\n| In surface landfills                             |                  0.12 |                  0.13 |                    0.22 |                    0.23 |\n| Other b                                          |                  0.1  |                  0.1  |                    0.02 |                    0.05 |\n| Waste disposed of                                |                  0.97 |                  0.87 |                    0.34 |                    0.38 |\n| Total waste generation                           |                  1.63 |                  1.43 |                    0.84 |                    0.78 |\n\n- a Waste is classified as hazardous or nonhazardous waste according to local regulations.\n- b Physical/chemical and biological treatment, underground disposal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contaminated sites\n\nWe have global standards for managing contaminated sites.

There are four main focus areas: developing infrastructure for waste collection, promoting innovative recycling methods, education and engagement of various stakeholders, and cleanup of areas heavily impacted by plastic waste. The initiative aims to invest up to $1.5/uni00A0billion by 2023.

It is used as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent, and to make our products. Our goods are transported via waterways. At the same time, water is a scarce commodity in more and more regions. That is why we promote the responsible use of this resource with sustainable water management.\n\n## At a glance\n\n## 1,695/uni00A0million Cubic meters\n\ntotal water abstraction\n\n78.5% of water demand covered\n\nby reuse\n\n- /uni25AA Responsible use a core part of our strategy\n- /uni25AA Global water target 53.5% achieved\n- /uni25AA Demand and utilization continuously optimized\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe responsible use of water as a resource is a core element of our Responsible Care Management System and an important part of our commitment to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is also reflected in our position paper on water protection , which we published in 2021.\n\nOur global standards and requirements for water are defined in Group-wide guidelines. Among other things, these stipulate that water protection concepts must be implemented at all production sites.  The  guidelines  also  cover  aspects  such  as  process  and transportation safety (see pages 120 and 125) in order to prevent production and transportation-related product spillages into water\n\nbodies as far as possible. Our sites and subsidiaries are responsible for implementing and complying with internal guidelines and legal requirements. The Environmental Protection, Health/uni00A0& Safety unit in the  Corporate  Center  conducts  regular  audits  to  monitor  this. BASF's global network of experts shares information, insights and best practices around the responsible use of water on an ongoing basis.\n\nIntroducing and implementing sustainable water management has been a cornerstone of our strategy for many years now. Our focus here is on our Verbund sites and on production sites in water stress areas. 1 The aim is to protect water as a resource, to use it as efficiently as possible through recirculation, and to continuously reduce wastewater and emissions. We consider the quantitative, qualitative and social aspects of water use.\n\nWe pursue our goal by applying the European Water Stewardship standard, which rests on four principles: sustainable water abstraction, maintaining good water quality, preserving conservation areas, and ensuring continuous improvement processes.\n\nWe advocate the responsible use of water as a resource along the entire value chain. We audit supplier compliance with environmental  standards  in  our  regular  supplier  assessments  (see page/uni00A0110). Where improvement is necessary, we support suppliers in developing and implementing appropriate measures, such as the correct handling of wastewater. In addition, we are involved in a wide range of initiatives to promote sustainability in the supply chain (see page/uni00A0113). For example, efficient water use is a core part of the Pragati project to improve sustainability in castor bean farming, the source of the castor oil we use.\n\nWe offer our customers solutions that help purify water and use it more efficiently while minimizing pollution. These include highperformance plastics to produce ultrafiltration membranes, seeds with higher drought and heat tolerance, or water-saving thin-film processes for metal pretreatment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe work with numerous partners along the value chain and from civil society to protect water as a resource. For instance, BASF is a member of the Alliance for Water Stewardship, a global multistakeholder organization that promotes the responsible use of water. We are co-founders of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) and are also involved in other global networks such as the World Plastics Council or Operation Clean Sweep to effectively reduce and prevent plastic waste, especially in water bodies.\n\nWe report transparently and comprehensively on water. For instance, we again provided detailed answers to the 2021 water survey from the nonprofit organization CDP . BASF again achieved leadership status with an A- rating in the final assessment. CDP evaluates how transparently companies report on their water management activities and how they reduce risks such as water scarcity. The assessment also considers the extent to which product developments can also contribute to sustainable water management at the customers of the evaluated companies.\n\n- For more information on our position paper on water protection, see basf.com/water\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the CDP water survey, see basf.com/en/cdp",

        "page_content": "## Global target and measures\n\nOur goal is to introduce sustainable water management at our Verbund sites and at all production sites in water stress areas by  2030,  covering  89%  of  BASF's  total  water  abstraction.  We achieved 53.5% of our target in 2021 (2020: 46.2%). 1 Sustainable water management was introduced at seven additional sites in 2021 (2020: 6).\n\nAs part of sustainable water management, our sites regularly assess the water situation in the catchment area . This raises awareness of potential risks and impacts for the population such as water scarcity. Based on the assessments conducted until the end of 2021, we did not identify any activities with a significant impact on water availability and quality at any site.\n\n## 2030 target\n\nIntroduction of sustainable water management at our production sites in water stress areas and at our Verbund  sites\n\nAnother important part of our sustainable water management is the continuous analysis and implementation of measures for improvement . For instance, we use wastewater from municipal wastewater treatment plants to reduce our demand for freshwater at our sites in Tarragona, Spain (since 2013) and Freeport, Texas (since 2019). At the Pontecchio site in Italy, we partially use rainwater, which reduced our demand for river and groundwater by 22,200/uni00A0cubic meters in 2021. In Belgium, our Verbund site in Antwerp is a member of the Lerend Netwerk Water network of the Belgian chemical association Essenscia together with other chemical and pharmaceutical companies. The aim is to facilitate dialog on the responsible use of water and to develop action plans for water conservation and circular water use. At the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, we have continually optimized cooling water needs over the past few years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water in the BASF/uni00A0Group 2021\n\nMillion cubic meters per year\n\n## Abstraction / supply\n\n## 1,695\n\nOf which in water stress areas: 1%\n\nSurface water / freshwater\n\n1,308\n\nGroundwater\n\nDrinking water\n\nWater from raw materials\n\nBrackish water / seawater\n\nReusable wastewater from third parties\n\n3\n\n259\n\n100\n\n20\n\n5\n\n87%\n\n13%\n\nwith various technical improvements. One example is the ethylene oxide plant, where a change in the pipeline route implemented in 2020 reduces the river water used for cooling purposes by around 4.7/uni00A0million cubic meters compared with the reference period (June 2019 to June 2020). Since then, the cooling system has operated without pumps. This also saves around 360,000 kilowatt hours of electricity compared with the reference period.\n\nDepending on the local situation, we also implement measures for improvement at our sites' catchment areas together with other stakeholders. One example is the Incentivo ao Produtor de \u00c1gua program that we launched at the Guaratinguet\u00e1 site in Brazil in 2011 together with local authorities, the Espa\u00e7o ECO Foundation and other partners. Measures such as better soil management or the reforestation of riverbank woodlands have since significantly reduced surface runoff and soil erosion in the Ribeir\u00e3o Guaratinguet\u00e1 catchment area.\n\n- 1 Our water target also continues to take into account the sites that we identified as water stress sites in accordance with Pfister et al. (2009) prior to 2019.\n\n## Water balance\n\nOur water abstraction totaled 1,695/uni00A0million cubic meters in 2021 (2020: 1,728). This demand was covered for the most part by freshwater such as rivers and lakes (84% of water abstraction). At some sites, we use alternative sources such as treated municipal wastewater, brackish water or seawater. A small part of the water we use reaches our sites as part of raw materials and steam, or is released in our production processes. We abstract most of the water we need for cooling and production ourselves. In 2021, 5% of our total water demand was covered by third parties (2020: 5%).\n\nWe predominantly use water for cooling purposes (87% of water abstraction), after which we discharge it back to our supply sources with no product contact. We reduce our demand for cooling water by recirculating as much of it as possible. To do this, we use recooling plants that allow water to be reused several times.

Most of the water used for production purposes is discharged back to water bodies after being treated in our own or third-party plants. Overall, 78.5% of the water we use in cooling or production is reused  several times.\n\nThe BASF/uni00A0Group's water consumption describes the amount of water that is not discharged to a water body, meaning that it is no longer available to other users. Consumption is mainly attributable to the evaporation of water in recirculating cooling systems. A smaller amount is from the water contained in our products. Water consumption in 2021 amounted to around 72/uni00A0million cubic meters (2020: 63/uni00A0million cubic meters).\n\nIn  2021,  around  25%  of  our  production  sites  were  located  in water stress areas (2020: 25%). These sites accounted for 1% of BASF's total water abstraction (2020: 1%). 1 In water stress areas, we  mainly source water from third parties (81%) and largely cover our demand with freshwater. Water consumption in water stress areas  accounted for 16% of BASF's total water consumption in 2021 (2020: 11%) and was primarily attributable to evaporation in cooling processes. Wastewater in water stress areas accounted for less than 1% of BASF's total wastewater. The share of wastewater from cooling processes in water stress areas is lower than for the BASF/uni00A0 Group as a whole. Cooling water is rarely used for oncethrough cooling here. Instead, it is generally recirculated to reduce water demand. Production wastewater in water stress areas is primarily treated at third-party facilities.\n\nThe supply, treatment, transportation and recooling of water is asso  ciated with a considerable energy demand. We are constantly working to optimize our energy consumption and the amount of water we use, and to adapt to the needs of our business and the environment.\n\n## Emissions to water\n\nA total of 1,503/uni00A0million cubic meters of water were discharged from BASF production sites in 2021 (2020: 1,429), including 177/uni00A0million cubic meters of wastewater from production.\n\nOur wastewater is subject to strict controls and we carefully assess the impact of wastewater discharge in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. Both internal audits and the responsible local authorities regularly assess whether the analyses and safety precautions at our sites comply with internal guidelines and legal requirements.\n\nEmissions of nitrogen to water amounted to 3,000/uni00A0metric tons in 2021 (2020: 2,900). Around 12,500 metric tons of organic substances were emitted in wastewater (2020: 11,500). Our wastewater contained 17/uni00A0metric tons of heavy metals (2020: 22). Phosphorus emissions amounted to 340/uni00A0metric tons (2020: 270).\n\nOur approach is to reduce wastewater volumes and contaminant loads at the source in our production processes and to reuse wastewater and material flows internally as far as possible. To treat wastewater, we use both central measures in wastewater treatment plants  and  the  selective  pretreatment  of  individual  wastewater streams before these are sent to the wastewater treatment plant. We use different methods depending on the type and degree of contamination - including biological processes, chemical oxidation, membrane technologies, precipitation or adsorption.\n\nIn order to avoid unanticipated emissions and the pollution of surface or groundwater, we have water protection concepts for our production sites in place. This is mandatory for all production plants as part of our Responsible Care Management System. The wastewater protection plans involve evaluating wastewater in terms of risk and drawing up suitable monitoring approaches. We use audits to check that these measures are being implemented and complied with.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Low flora  and  fauna  diversity  weakens  ecosystems'  ability  to withstand changes such as climate change. As a chemical company, we depend on ecosystem services like the availability of renewable resources and high air, water and soil quality, while also influencing them. Protecting biodiversity is a key element of our commitment to sustainability.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Strategic alignment of our biodiversity measures based on impact  assessments\n- /uni25AA Commitment to preserving biodiversity along the entire value chain with strategic partnerships\n\n## Strategy\n\nBASF sees the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - including Life below water (SDG/uni00A0 14) and Life on land (SDG/uni00A0 15) - as important orientation and reference frameworks. Our measures help to preserve biodiversity and meet our responsibility to maintaining the wellbeing of the environment and society. Our corporate sustainability goals on climate protection, product portfolio, circular economy, water management and responsible procurement also help to protect biodiversity.\n\nWe align our biodiversity measures with the impact of our business activities along the value chain. Our focus here is on three impact areas: supply chains, sites and production, and product impact. We analyzed these in an internal workshop according to the five drivers of biodiversity loss as defined by the Intergovernmental SciencePolicy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. These are\n\nland-use change, climate change, invasive species, overexploitation and pollution. Our analysis showed that our impacts along the value chain mainly relate to the drivers of climate change, land-use change and pollution. We counteract the climate change driver of biodiversity loss - and in this way, help to preserve biodiversity - with our climate protection measures, which play an integral role in all our impact areas (see page 126).\n\nWe use various methods to measure our sustainability performance that  implicitly  and  explicitly  consider  relevant  risks  and opportunities  for  biodiversity.  These  include  the  Eco-Efficiency Analysis,  SEEbalance \u00ae ,  Sustainable  Solution  Steering,  Value  to Society,  AgBalance \u00ae and the corresponding biodiversity calculator. Under Value to Society, we assess land use along value chains, among other things. Newly developed assessment methods help us to understand further influences on biodiversity. On the basis of this understanding, we seek dialog with partners and enter into strategic partnerships, through which we drive forward measures to protect biodiversity around the world.\n\n## Responsibility to our supply chains\n\nSome of the business activities of our raw material suppliers involve land uses that can influence biodiversity (biodiversity loss driver: land-use change). We have laid down our expectations of our suppliers with regard to environmental, labor and social standards in the supply chain in the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 109).\n\nBASF procures a variety of renewable raw materials. In the procurement of palm and palm kernel oil in particular, there is an elevated risk that forest areas are cleared to create farmland. To improve sustainability in procurement, we established the BASF Palm Commitment in 2011, which was updated in 2015 and is implemented with our Palm Sourcing Policy. Third-party certification with standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standard enables us to take biodiversity criteria into account when purchasing raw materials (see page 113). We are also committed to the environmental sustainability of other supply chains through our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nown initiatives, such as our rambutan program . This was launched in 2014 in close collaboration with partners in Vietnam to source botanical ingredients for cosmetic products from certified organic rambutan gardens. In cooperation with local farmers and NGOs, BASF's program promotes the preservation of biodiverse habitats, as well as good agricultural practices, gender equity and fair working conditions.\n\nOur position on forest protection sets out our commitment to preserving biodiversity in areas of High Conservation Value such as High Carbon Stock forest areas and peatlands in the procurement of renewable raw materials. BASF participated in the 'Forests' assessment conducted by the international organization CDP for the second time in 2021 and achieved a score of A-, again giving it Leadership status. CPD is a nonprofit organization that evaluates companies' management of the environmental risks and opportunities relating to forests, among other things. The assessment is conducted based on detailed insights into the palm value chain and activities that impact ecosystems and natural habitats.\n\n## Responsibility to our sites and production\n\nPreservation  of  biodiversity  is  taken  into  consideration  in  the manage ment of our sites. We operate our facilities in a responsible manner and minimize negative effects on the environment (biodiversity loss driver: pollution) by keeping air, water and soil  emissions as low as possible and reducing and avoiding waste (see page 133 for more information).\n\nOur site management measures consider our impact on the biodiversity loss driver of land-use change. For example, given the rele vance of conservation areas to preserving diversity, we check how close our production sites are to internationally recognized conservation  areas.  In  2021,  we  included  this  indicator  in  our environmental database. This allows us to raise awareness of biodiversity at local level and draw attention to potential impacts of our sites on these areas. Four percent of our production sites are adjacent to a Ramsar site and 1% are adjacent to a category/uni00A0I, II or",

In  addition,  we  systematically  consider  sustainability aspects when deciding whether to invest in the construction of new sites or expand existing ones. Aspects assessed include the potential impacts on forests and biodiversity.\n\nWe are implementing local measures to protect biodiversity at a number of sites. In Clermont, France, for example, grassed areas were converted into biodiversity-friendly spaces, nesting boxes for swallows and other bird species were installed, and their population sizes were measured and documented. In addition, training was held to raise employees' awareness of biodiversity.\n\nWe also take biodiversity conservation into account in our production . We are committed to complying with the provisions of international environmental agreements such as the Nagoya Protocol. The supplementary agreement to the U.N.'s Convention on Biological Diversity regulates access to genetic resources and access and benefit sharing. It sets out obligations (for example, compensation payments) for the users of genetic resources such as plant-based raw materials. We use internal control mechanisms to monitor compliance with standards.\n\n## Management of our product impact\n\nBASF offers products and solutions for a wide range of industries. We want to ensure that our products meet our customers' standards in quality and, through appropriate use, pose no risk to  humans, animals or the environment. Our commitment to the objectives set forth by the Responsible Care \u00ae charter of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) obligates us to  continuously minimize the negative effects of our products on the environment, health and safety and\n\nto optimize our products on an ongoing basis. It is important to consider the potential impacts of product use on biodiversity, for example, with regard to the biodiversity loss driver of pollution.\n\nFor example, we evaluate our products and solutions in crop protection and seeds throughout the entire research, development and registration process. After they have been approved for the market, we continue assessing them regularly for potential risks and impact to the ecosystems in which they are used. We have initiated various projects and offer training to prevent misuse of our products (see page 124).\n\nAll types of land development , such as agriculture and forestry, play a role in changing biodiversity (biodiversity loss driver: land-use change). Activities such as tillage, drainage, fertilization and the use of crop protection products can affect flora and fauna, for example, by influencing food sources. Minimizing these impacts while ensuring the necessary productivity is one of the biggest challenges farmers are facing. Our Agricultural Solutions segment focuses on four areas to help farmers to find the right balance: climate-smart farming, sustainable solutions, digital farming and smart stewardship (see page 90). In this context, we work with farmers to create balanced agricultural systems which enable productive and efficient farming of high-quality food products and at the same time promote biodiversity in the field. For example, we advise them on soil cultivation and look for suitable ways to improve biodiversity in farmlands. Our many years of experience in sustainability measurement and evaluation in agriculture are particularly useful here.\n\nOur AgBalance \u00ae method and the biodiversity calculator, which has  been  available  since  2020,  enable  a  scientifically  sound assessment of the impact of agricultural practices on  biodiversity. Based on these assessments, we issue recommendations for measures such as planting flower strips or establishing nesting places to benefit pollinators like wild bees and farmland birds. Our modern seed solutions also enable better yield on existing farmlands and thus help protect natural habitats.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiative to preserve the habitat of the monarch butterfly\n\nThe  Alas  para  el  Campo  cooperation  between  the  German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), BASF and partners from politics, academia, distributors and local communities was launched in Mexico in 2019. The aim is to restore the natural habitat of the monarch butterfly along its migration route. This also protects other pollinators. The focus of the initiative is on introducing  sustainable  farming  measures,  good  agricultural practices and ecosystem conservation strategies, for the protection  of  pollinators  and  other  beneficial  insects.  This  enables farmers in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean to restore natural habitats to promote biodiversity while laying the foundation for sustainable yields and prosperity in their communities.\n\nBASF started the global registration for a new, more  environmentally friendly insecticide active ingredient in 2021. The active ingredient, Axalion TM , enables farmers to control a wide range of piercing and sucking pests that are harmful to crops. At the same time, it is  highly compatible with beneficial insects such as pollinators. This supports",

Industrialized livestock production also requires large areas of agricultural land for growing feed, which has implications for the share of forest areas and biodiversity. BASF offers a range of feed additives such as enzymes, vitamins, glycinates and organic acids that improve nutrient utilization from feed. Better feed conversion and more sustainable livestock production mean that less land is needed, preserving natural ecosystems.\n\n## Strategic partnerships to promote biodiversity\n\nEngaging in ongoing dialog with a variety of stakeholders is important to BASF. That is why we seek out partnerships with relevant interest groups and organizations worldwide to raise awareness of biodiversity and drive forward the action needed to preserve natural habitats. This enables us to firstly share the knowledge gained from our biodiversity activities and secondly learn from others to improve our own practices.\n\nWe cooperate with a number of organizations including the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, the Sustainable Palm Oil Forum, the Brazilian Coalition on Climate, Forests and Agriculture and the High Carbon Stock Approach Steering Group. The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is working to provide a framework for reporting on nature-related risks and related activities. In 2021, BASF joined the newly established TNFD Forum, a consultative network, to support this development. Our involvement in organizations such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and the Alliance for Water Stewardship (see page 135) help to preserve biodiversity in bodies of water.\n\nTogether with international partners and based on dialog with stakeholders in the food value chain, we are driving forward measures to promote  sustainable  agriculture . In  the  United  States,  for\n\nexample, BASF is a member of the Honey Bee Health Coalition, which aims to achieve healthy honey bee populations and support healthy populations of native and managed pollinators in productive agricultural systems and thriving ecosystems. BASF France is part of  the  Entreprises  pour  l'environnement  (EpE)  network,  which launched the Act4nature campaign with the main objective of protecting and enhancing biodiversity.\n\nSince 2013, we have also been working with different farmers and experts from the BASF FarmNetwork Sustainability , an association of farms in Europe, to integrate more connected biodiversity areas into agricultural production. Based on the insights gained from working together, an advisory board of experts from agriculture,  nature  conservation  and  environmental  protection developed a biodiversity checklist and published it in 2021. This summarizes 10 ecologically effective and practicable measures to promote biodiversity. Since 2021, BASF has supported farmers participating in its #wirzahlenBiodiversit\u00e4t ('We pay biodiversity') program financially and with professional advice. Our initiatives to preserve  biodiversity  help  farmers  to  achieve  the  right  balance between economic and environmental factors and help them make an important societal contribution to the preservation of  ecosystems.\n\n- For more information on our responsible management of resources, see page 44\n\nFor more information on product stewardship, see pages 123 and 124\n\n- For more information on our commitment to biodiversity, see basf.com/biodiversity For more information on our position on forest protection, see basf.com/forestprotection\n\n<!-- image -->",

We ensure that the business units follow standard processes to evaluate and take into account relevant sustainability criteria  when  they  develop  and  implement  strategies,  research projects and innovation processes.\n\nAccelerator products make a substantial sustainability contribution in the value chain. These include catalysts that reduce emissions to the environment, biodegradable mulch films for agricultural applications, and high-performance insulation materials for higher energy savings and reduced material use in building construction.\n\nBased on our corporate strategy, we have set ourselves a global target: We aim to make sustainability an even greater part of our innovation power and achieve \u20ac22 billion in Accelerator sales by 2025. We met this target already in 2021. Consequently, we will update our product portfolio steering target over the course of 2022.\n\nA significant steering tool for the product portfolio, based on the sustainability performance of our products, is the Sustainable Solution Steering method. It considers our products' applications in various markets and customer industries. Transparently classifying our products on the basis of their contribution to sustainability\n\n## Classification of assessed portfolio according to the Sustainable Solution Steering method\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nenables us to systematically improve them. We review the categorization of the portfolio at least every four years. This includes analyzing the portfolio in workshops.\n\nIf, during reassessment of our portfolio, we identify products with significant sustainability concerns, we classify these as ' challenged.' We  develop  and  systematically  implement  action  plans  for  all products in this category. These include research projects and reformulations to optimize products, or even replacing the product with an alternative. To systematically align our portfolio with con-\n\ntributions to sustainability, in 2018 we started phasing out all Challenged  products within five years of their initial classification at the latest. We strive to offer products that make a greater contribution to sustainability in their area of application to live up to our own commitments and meet our customers' demands. That is why an adapted version of our Sustainable Solution Steering method is used in areas such as our research and development pipeline, and in merger and acquisition projects.

This refers to the BASF/uni00A0Group's sales from products in its strategic portfolio to third parties in the business  year  concerned.  By  the  end  of  2021,  sustainability ana lyses and assessments had been conducted for more than 56,000/uni00A0 specific product applications (2020: >57,000), accounting for \u20ac71/uni00A0billion in sales (2020: \u20ac54.1/uni00A0billion).\n\nIn  2021,  we  generated  sales  of  \u20ac24.1/uni00A0 billion  with  Accelerator products (2020: \u20ac16.7/uni00A0billion) - already reaching our target for 2025. Accelerator products account for 33.9% of the assessed relevant portfolio. Sales of Accelerator products rose by 44.3% compared with the previous year. This is primarily attributable to the positive development  of  Accelerator  sales  in  the  Surface  Technologies and Chemicals segments. Performer products account for 54.9%, Transitioner products for 11.1% and Challenged products for 0.1% of the solutions assessed.\n\nNew market requirements arise as a result of the continuous development of new product solutions in the industry or changing  regulatory frameworks. This has an effect on the comparative  assessment, which is why we regularly reassess our product  portfolio.\n\n- For more information on Sustainable Solution Steering, see basf.com/en/sustainable-solution-steering\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Circular economy\n\nCircularity is a particular focus in the continued development of our product portfolio. This enables us to help our customers achieve their sustainability goals while improving the resource and carbon footprint of our products.\n\nBy 2030, we aim to generate sales of \u20ac17/uni00A0billion with solutions for the circular economy. These include products based on renewable or recycled raw materials that close material cycles ('close the loop') or increase the resource efficiency or life of materials ('extend the loop').\n\nIn addition, we want to increasingly use alternative raw materials in the manufacturing of our products. These include bio-based raw materials such as bionaphtha and biogas, and renewable raw materials such as RSPO-certified palm oil, which we have been using for many years as a substitute for fossil resources. To expand our  supply base for alternative raw materials and at the same time, contribute to the circular economy, we are also developing new, waste-based sources of raw materials. To achieve this, we develop innovative technologies, usually in cooperation with partners, for example for the chemical recycling of plastic waste or disposed mattresses made of polyurethane. We aim to process 250,000/uni00A0metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials in our production plants annually from 2025.\n\nOne of the steps we have taken to achieve our goals is establishing a company-wide Circular Economy Program. As part of this program, BASF teams are currently developing new approaches to the three main action areas in more than 35/uni00A0initiatives: alternative raw material pathways, innovative material cycles and new business models for the circular economy - which also include digital and service-based concepts.\n\n- For more information on the circular economy, see page 44\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on raw materials, see page 112 onward\n\n## Product Carbon Footprint\n\nIn line with increasingly ambitious climate protection targets, CO2 transparency is becoming more and more important for us and our customers. We have published a comprehensive corporate carbon footprint along our value chain every year since 2008. In addition, we already calculated carbon footprints for individual products in the past. To further increase transparency, we developed a digital solution to determine product-specific greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 and have since calculated the carbon footprints of around 45,000 sales products. These Product Carbon Footprints include all greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  raw  material  extraction  to  the finished BASF product leaving the factory gates ('cradle-to-gate').\n\n- 1 The definition of the relevant portfolio and further information can be found in the Sustainable Solution Steering manual at basf.com/en/sustainable-solution-steering\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe data helps us to target our CO2 reduction measures to those areas where our customers can later achieve the greatest value added from lower carbon emissions in the value chain.\n\nTo determine the carbon footprint of our purchased raw materials (upstream Scope/uni00A0 3 emissions), we have until now worked with industry averages and values from external databases. To obtain a more accurate data base and reduce emissions in the supply chain, we launched our Supplier CO2 Management Program in 2021. The aim of the program is to, in a first step, determine the carbon footprints of raw materials as accurately as possible. We support our suppliers here by sharing our knowledge of valuation and calculation methods, for example. In the second step, we then want to work with our suppliers to identify levers and targets to continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on our corporate carbon footprint and Supplier CO2 Management Program, see page 130 onward",

BASF supplies it to one of the largest solar projects in the world - Noor Energy/uni00A01 in Dubai.\n\n## In focus:\n\n## BASF Solutions for a Sustainable Future\n\nSolutions based on chemistry are fundamental to a sustainable future. Every day, around 111,000/uni00A0 employees at BASF work to turn good ideas into innovative products that help solve global challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity or food supply.\n\n## Enabling climate-smart mobility\n\nThe transportation sector is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases. In Europe, for example, around one-quarter of all CO2 emissions are caused by road traffic. BASF helps to reduce exhaust emissions and vehicle fuel consumption with innovative solutions to treat exhaust gases such as zeolite/uni00A0 SCR/uni00A0 catalysts or tri-metal  catalyst technology (see page 82), Keropur \u00ae fuel additives or light weight high-performance plastics such as Ultramid \u00ae , Ultradur \u00ae or  Elastoflex \u00ae .\n\nAt the same time, as a leading supplier of battery materials for lithium-ion batteries, we are paving the way for the age of electromobility. Here, too, the focus is on sustainability - from the responsible procurement of mineral raw materials and the most economical use in production to recycling at the end of the life cycle. In the future, the carbon footprint of our European production will be significantly below the industry standard thanks to our efficient manufacturing processes, the high share of renewable energy, and regional procurement and recycling of key raw materials.\n\nIn aviation, the Novaflex Sharkskin surface film developed jointly with Lufthansa Technik leads to noticeable CO2 reductions. Its structure is modeled on sharkskin and optimizes aerodynamics at the flowrelated parts of the aircraft. The sharkskin technology will be used on Lufthansa Cargo's entire freighter fleet from 2022. Through its use on the 10 Boeing 777F freighters alone, Lufthansa Technik\n\nexpects to save around 3,700 metric tons of kerosene and reduce CO2 by around 11,700 metric tons every year.\n\n## Making better use of sun and wind\n\nBASF products enable renewable energies to be used more efficiently. One example is solar salt. This mixture of sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate is used in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants (image left). As a heat transfer fluid at high temperatures of over 550/uni00A0 degrees/uni00A0 Celsius, molten solar salt allows solar energy to be stored and thus used even in bad weather or at night.\n\nOther examples are the amine-based hardeners Baxxodur \u00ae EC 301 and EC 201. Both have proven effective in processing epoxy resins for  the  manufacture  of  rotor  blades  for  modern  wind  turbines. Baxxodur \u00ae hardeners contribute significantly to the advantageous properties of the cured epoxy resin, such as low weight, high mechanical strength, and high chemical and thermal resistance - all of which are key to the longevity of rotor blades.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the end product - in the case of Neopor \u00ae BMB, by 66% per cubic meter of insulation panel compared with conventional Neopor \u00ae .\n\n## Creating new products from waste\n\nOur innovative technologies and solutions help to reduce waste generation and increase the amount of waste that can be recycled. One example is our portfolio of plastics additives. Among other things, these additives help to reduce waste by improving the durability of materials. Additives also enable improved mechanical recycling. For example, the IrgaCycle TM product series launched in 2021 helps our customers avoid certain quality problems in mechanically recycled plastics. This means that recycled plastics can also be used for higher-value applications and recycled content can be increased in the manufacture of new products.\n\nIn addition to our mechanical recycling solutions, we are driving forward chemical recycling (see page 115). In our ChemCycling TM project, our technology partners convert waste such as used tires or mixed plastic waste, which was not previously recycled, into pyrolysis oil. We can feed this pyrolysis oil into our Verbund structure in place of fossil raw materials and use it to make new products based on a certified mass balance approach. This reduces waste, saves resources and simultaneously reduces the carbon footprint of our products. One example is Styropor \u00ae Ccycled TM , which is used to manufacture products like insulated transport boxes for temperaturesensitive goods such as coronavirus vaccines. Another application is functional textiles. For example, VAUDE will be launching outdoor pants made using our Ultramid \u00ae Ccycled TM polyamide from 2022.\n\nMaterials such as Infinergy \u00ae can be recycled. The expanded polyurethane is used in products such as shoe soles thanks to its outstanding spring and cushioning properties. Through a combination of mechanical processing and finishing, Infinergy can be recycled and regenerated with its original level of material quality.\n\nWe also have sustainable solutions for packaging and food containers made of cardboard, such as cups or boxes. Until now, these have typically been coated with a thin layer of polyethylene, which provides a protective barrier to liquids. However, this plastic layer makes recycling difficult. With its Joncryl HPB 4K range, BASF has developed a dispersion system that provides an excellent liquid barrier. Unlike conventional solutions, it is water-based. This makes it possible to efficiently recycle coated cardboard.\n\n## Natural ingredients for industrial and consumer goods\n\nBoth industrial users and end consumers are increasingly interested in nature-based ingredients. We are addressing this trend with a growing  portfolio  of  plant-based  solutions.  One  example  is Disponil \u00ae /uni00A0 APG/uni00A0 215 for the wood processing industry. Used as an adjuvant in production, this surfactant increases the bond strength of medium-density fiberboard (MDF). This enables manufacturers to achieve  a  denser  and  smoother  surface  and  with  it,  improved water-repellent properties compared with conventional manufacturing processes. Disponil \u00ae /uni00A0APG/uni00A0215 also offers energy saving potential in the production process and is 100% based on natural, renewable plant-based raw materials.\n\nAlongside the natural trend, sensory characteristics such as consistency and texture play an important role in skin and hair care. That is why we are researching and developing alternatives to synthetic ingredients and excipients for cosmetics and personal care products. One example is Hydagen \u00ae Clean. Launched on the market in 2021, the biopolymer is characterized by its ease of use and high quality. It can be processed in both cold and hot water and is biodegradable. It is extracted from the tuber of the konjac plant native\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto southwest China and is suitable for applications such as gels and fluids, as well as novel products such as patches and jelly  cosmetics.\n\n## Reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture\n\nThe demand for food, feed and energy is increasing, while natural resources  are  limited.  Agriculture  is  a  key  enabler  in  providing enough healthy, affordable food. Our innovative solutions help farmers  find  the  right  balance  between  productive  and  sustainable cultivation. One example is Revysol \u00ae . The new fungicidal active ingredient controls several economically important fungal diseases in several key crops globally. Its enhanced efficacy, improved selectivity and favorable regulatory profile allows farmers to maximize yield and to reduce the need to convert more natural habitat to farmland. Revysol \u00ae 's performance and its formulation innovation, which provides long-lasting protection under critical weather conditions, avoids the need for repeated fungicide applications. Revysol \u00ae helps to significantly reduce CO2 emissions per ton of crop.\n\nBASF tapped the Brazilian market with Pingo Doce TM watermelons, introducing not only high-quality seeds but also a new business model. BASF provides technical support to farmers and demonstrates best practices in efficient water management, fertilization and traceability to establish sustainable production. Regular quality controls are carried out to check the sweetness, color and size of the watermelons in order to reduce the amount of fruit rejected by supermarkets. This new approach delivers a product that benefits farmers, consumers and the environment alike.",

        "page_content": "## Forecast\n\nWe expect the global economic recovery to continue in 2022. As a result, we anticipate global GDP growth of 3.8% (2021: +5.8%). Global growth should be supported by the gradual containment of the coronavirus pandemic. In the advanced economies in  particular, demand will increasingly shift from goods to services. However, the bottlenecks in global supply chains will ease only slowly. As order backlogs in industry are high, we expect global industrial production to grow at an above-average rate of 3.8% and chemical production at 3.5%.\n\n## Economic Environment in 2022 1\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Moderate GDP growth expected in Europe and the United States\n- /uni25AA Strong growth assumed in Asia\n- /uni25AA Moderate growth in global industrial production\n- /uni25AA Fragile recovery in the automotive industry\n- /uni25AA Slower but still above-average growth forecast for the chemical industry\n\nFor Europe and the United States, we expect a moderate weakening of growth momentum compared with the previous year. For China, however, - which made an earlier start to its economic recovery following the downturn in 2020 - we anticipate much slower but still solid growth. Growth in the other emerging markets in Asia will likely be slightly stronger than in the previous year.\n\nHowever, uncertainty about future developments remains high. The further course of the coronavirus pandemic could impact  demand more severely than expected. Supply difficulties in the global value chains could continue for longer than assumed in our outlook. High\n\nenergy prices and higher inflation rates could dampen consumer purchasing power more strongly than expected in our forecast.\n\n## Trends in the global economy in 2022\n\nOverall, we anticipate moderate GDP growth of 3.6% (2021: 5.2%) in the European Union (E.U.) . This will be driven in part by the economic upturn in the services sector and the gradual overcoming of supply difficulties that we anticipate for the industrial sector. Growth will also be supported by payments from the European Recovery  and  Resilience  Facility.  We  expect  the  differences  in growth rates between the E.U. member states to be less pronounced than in the previous year. The dynamic recovery in the western European countries that grew particularly strongly in 2021 (France, Italy) is expected to weaken somewhat, while Germany should see slightly stronger growth. In the eastern E.U. countries, we expect growth rates to converge at a similar level.\n\nWe  expect  the  recovery  to  continue  in  the United  Kingdom , although this is subject to considerable uncertainty. In particular, labor shortages in logistics and hospitality may slow further recovery. Overall, we anticipate GDP growth of 3.8% there (2021: 7.5%).\n\n- 1 Our assumptions account for current estimates by external institutions, including economic research institutes, banks, multinational organizations and consulting firms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this section: Economic Environment 2022 Outlook 2022 Opportunities and Risks\n\nFor the United States , we are forecasting growth of 3.8% (2021: 5.7%). Growth will be supported by government spending on infrastructure, social and climate programs. A continued revival of the labor market should partially compensate for the phasing out of extended unemployment benefits under the COVID relief package. Delays in the clearance of goods at U.S. ports should gradu ally become less relevant as growth in demand for goods slows and shifts toward the services sector. In addition, congestion at ports should  gradually  ease.  Labor  shortages  will  prevent  a  stronger upturn, which will dampen the recovery in the services sector in particular.\n\nWe expect growth in the emerging markets of Asia to slow overall. In China , the real estate sector will cool. In addition, the zero- tolerance policy toward the coronavirus pandemic will likely curb the recovery in private consumption. We also assume that selective measures to contain new coronavirus outbreaks will continue  to  negatively  impact  industrial  value  chains  and  logistics. Overall, we expect Chinese GDP to grow by 4.5% in 2022 (2021: 8.1%).  Economic development in India remains uncertain given the still low vaccination rate. We expect growth there to be slightly lower than in the previous year (2022: 7.0%; 2021: 8.1%). This will be driven in particular by a recovery in private consumption. In this",

        "page_content": "environ ment, we expect slightly higher GDP growth of 4.6% (2021: 4.2%) for the other emerging Asian economies. This is anticipated due to positive base effects and a gradual recovery in tourism.\n\nIn Japan , we expect growth momentum to pick up only slightly in the  coming year (+2.5%) after weak growth of just 1.7% in 2021. Growth will be supported by private consumption and investment, while the slowdown in China is expected to have a dampening effect on exports. Government stimulus measures could however accelerate growth more strongly than assumed in our forecast.\n\nIn South America , growth is expected to weaken significantly in 2022. High net exports of industrial and agricultural commodities will continue to support the Brazilian economy but will no longer provide strong growth impetus. Growth in domestic demand will be curbed by high inflation rates, increased debt and rising interest rates. Overall, we are forecasting growth of only 0.4% for Brazil in 2022 (2021: 4.7%). In Argentina , too, growth will slow significantly against the backdrop of continued very high inflation and increasing fiscal consolidation requirements (2022: 2.3%; 2021: 9.0%). For the other emerging markets in South America, we expect growth to be  slightly higher  compared  with  other  countries,  but  likewise  significantly weaker year on year (2022: 3.2%; 2021: 9.5%), as the positive base effects from the previous year also level off in these countries.\n\n## Outlook for gross domestic product 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| World                    | 3.8%   |\n|--------------------------|--------|\n| European Union           | 3.6%   |\n| United States            | 3.8%   |\n| Emerging markets of Asia | 4.8%   |\n| Japan                    | 2.5%   |\n\n## Trends in gross domestic product 2022-2024\n\nAverage annual real change\n\n| World                    | 3.2%   |\n|--------------------------|--------|\n| European Union           | 2.6%   |\n| United States            | 2.8%   |\n| Emerging markets of Asia |        |\n| Japan                    | 1.7%   |\n| South America            | 2.0%   |\n\n## Outlook for key customer industries\n\nOverall, we anticipate growth of 3.8% (2021: 6.5%) in global industrial production. Growth in the advanced economies (2022: 3.4%; 2021: 5.3%) is likely to be weaker than growth in the emerging markets (2022: 4.1%; 2021: 7.4%).\n\nWe are forecasting higher growth in the transportation industry 1 in 2022 compared with our other customer industries on average. Based on the current, exceptionally low level, we expect production in the automotive industry to return to strong growth. Overall, production volumes will however still remain well below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. Growth should pick up again in Europe in particular, after automotive production declined by 26% overall in 2020 and 2021. North America also has a lot of ground to make up.\n\n- 1 The transportation industry includes the production of motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts and the construction of other vehicles (especially ships and boats, trains, air and spacecraft, and two-wheelers).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAuto motive production there fell by around one-fifth overall in the past two years, compared with around 7% in Asia. Accordingly, we anticipate the strongest catch-up effects in Europe, followed by North America and Asia. However, the supply of precursors, especially semiconductors, will remain a problem and will continue to limit growth.\n\nIn the energy and raw materials sector, we are forecasting slightly higher production growth than in 2021 due to strong demand and higher raw materials prices. We expect the OPEC+ countries to continue to gradually step up oil production. Oil and gas production in the United States should increase as well.\n\nGrowth in the construction industry is expected to weaken somewhat. More so than in 2021, commercial construction and infrastructure investment will be a stronger driver than new residential construction. Residential construction activity is expected to cool sharply, especially in China. However, the infrastructure program in the United States, projects under the European Recovery and Resilience Facility, further government programs to support the ener getic renovation of existing buildings and still low interest rates will continue to support growth in the construction industry.\n\nConsumer goods production is expected to grow slightly faster than global GDP. We expect growth in textiles and consumer durables to decline. Production of care products will presumably likewise grow at a slightly slower rate than in the previous year.\n\nIn the electronics industry , demand is likely to remain high and benefit from the ongoing trend toward digitalization and automation in many areas of application, both in industry and in private households. Nevertheless, we expect weaker growth compared with the exceptionally strong prior year.\n\nIn the health and nutrition sector, we are forecasting lower growth compared with 2021, as the exceptionally strong growth in the pharmaceutical industry is expected to level off.

Production in industrialized countries will grow only weakly. By contrast, we anticipate solid production growth in emerging markets such as Argentina, China, India and Ukraine.\n\n## Outlook for the chemical industry\n\nGlobal chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) is expected to grow by 3.5% in 2022, slower than in the previous year (2021: 6.1%) but still above the average for the years prior to the coronavirus pandemic. In the advanced economies, we anticipate growth of 3.1% (2021: 3.9%), which is above the average for the pre-crisis years. Growth in the emerging markets is expected to slow at a much stronger rate (2022: +3.7%; 2021: 7.2%). Based on these forecasts, global chemical production at the end of the year will be almost 10% above the 2019 level.\n\n- In China , the world's largest chemical market, we are forecasting much weaker growth in chemical production of 4.0% as base  effects from the previous year level off (2021: 7.7%). Growth in demand  for chemicals in the consumer goods industries and from the electronics industry is expected to weaken. We anticipate continued growth in  demand  from  the  Chinese  automotive  industry.  In  the  other emerging markets of Asia, we expect chemical growth to be slightly weaker than in China.\n\nIn the E.U. , we expect chemical production to increase by 2.8% (2021: 6.0%). We anticipate a significant recovery in the automotive industry, which will strengthen growth in demand for chemicals. For the other customer industries, we are forecasting growth slightly above the long-term average. However, momentum in chemical production already slowed over the course of 2021. As a result, the European chemical industry will presumably grow below the average\n\nfor the manufacturing sector. We are assuming growth of 2.0% in the United Kingdom (2021: 2.5%).\n\nFor the United States , we are forecasting significantly stronger growth in chemical production (2022: 4.5%; 2021: 1.8%) following the weather-related production outages in the previous year. In addition to statistical base effects, we expect growing demand above all from the automotive industry, the energy sector and the consumer goods industry.\n\n- In Japan , we expect growth in chemical production to track the growth rate for GDP. The strongest growth stimulus will be provided by the electronics industry and the automotive sector (2022: 2.5%; 2021: 3.7%).\n\nChemical production in South America will presumably grow at around the same rate as the economy as a whole (2022: 1.5%; 2021: 4.6%). This will be primarily driven by the significant recovery in  automotive  production  and  continued  moderate  growth  in demand from agriculture and the raw materials sector.\n\n## Outlook for chemical production 2022 (excluding pharmaceuticals)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| World                    | 3.5%   |\n|--------------------------|--------|\n| European Union           | 2.8%   |\n| United States            | 4.5%   |\n| Emerging markets of Asia | 3.9%   |\n| Japan                    | 2.5%   |\n| South America            | 1.5%   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trends in chemical production 2022-2024 (excluding pharmaceuticals)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Average annual real change   |      |\n|------------------------------|------|\n| World                        | 2.0% |\n| United States                | 2.7% |\n| Emerging markets of Asia     |      |\n| Japan                        | 4.1% |\n| South America                | 2.1% |",

Our forecast range takes into account  uncertainty resulting in particular from the effects of ongoing supply chain disruptions, the further course of the coronavirus pandemic and the development of energy prices. The global economy is expected to grow by 3.8% in 2022 (2021: 5.8%). As order backlogs in industry are high, we expect global industrial production to grow by 3.8% (2021: 6.5%) and chemical production by 3.5% (2021: 6.1%). We anticipate an average oil price of $75 for a barrel of Brent crude and an exchange rate of $1.15 per euro.\n\nBased on these assumptions, we are forecasting sales of between \u20ac74 billion and \u20ac77 billion (2021: \u20ac78.6 billion). The BASF Group's income from operations (EBIT) before special items is expected to be between \u20ac6.6 billion and \u20ac7.2 billion (2021: \u20ac7.8 billion).

Contributing factors will include the volume growth expected in all segments and slightly positive portfolio effects from the formation of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd. We anticipate lower price levels, mainly from lower commodity and precious metal prices, which will lead to a significant decrease in sales in the  Surface  Technologies  and  Chemicals  segments.  We  expect slightly lower sales in the Industrial Solutions segment due to negative portfolio effects from the sale of the pigments and kaolin businesses. By contrast, we are forecasting considerable sales growth in the Agricultural Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments following significant price increases. We expect slightly higher sales in the Materials segment and in Other.\n\nThe BASF Group's EBIT before special items is expected to decline to between \u20ac6.6 billion and \u20ac7.2 billion. We anticipate significantly lower contributions from the Chemicals and Materials segments and from Other. We are forecasting slightly lower EBIT before special items in\n\nthe Industrial Solutions and Surface Technologies segments. The Agricultural Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments plan to considerably increase EBIT before special items.\n\nBased on the forecast for global economic development and  expected business development in the BASF Group in 2022, we expect a ROCE of between 11.4% and 12.6%. Compared with the previous year, we anticipate a considerable decrease in ROCE in the Chemicals, Materials and Surface Technologies segments. The Agricultural Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments are expected to considerably increase ROCE, while the Industrial Solutions segment will see a slight increase.\n\n## CO2 emissions forecast for the BASF Group\n\nCO2 emissions are expected to be between 19.6 million metric tons and 20.6 million metric tons in 2022. We will take specific emission reduction measures to limit the additional emissions from moderate growth and the expected higher capacity utilization of the ammonia plants following low capacity utilization in 2021. These include measures to increase energy efficiency and process optimization, as well as the continued shift to renewable energy. In addition, the reductions in emissions from divestitures, including the agreed sale of the kaolin business, will slightly more than compensate for the additional emissions from the formation of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd. in 2022.\n\n- 1 For sales, 'slight' represents a change of 0.1%-5.0%, while 'considerable' applies to changes of 5.1% and higher.

At a cost of capital percentage of 9% for 2022, we define a change in ROCE of 0.1 to 1.0 percentage points as 'slight,' a change of more than 1.0 percentage points as 'considerable' and no change (+/-0.0 percentage points) as 'at prior-year level.'\n\nThe material opportunities and risks that could affect our forecast are described under Opportunities and Risks on pages 151 to 160.\n\n## Sales and earnings forecast for the segments\n\nFor the Chemicals segment in 2022, we expect sales to decline considerably following very high prices in 2021 due to supply shortages in the market. The decrease in 2022 will be driven by considerably lower sales in the Petrochemicals division. We expect a normalization  of  the  market  situation,  particularly  in  the  United States, following the supply disruption caused by Winter Storm Uri in January 2021. In the Intermediates division, we anticipate higher sales volumes driven mainly by amines and polyalcohols. Prices in the segment are expected to decline to a lower level while higher raw materials prices will put pressure on margins. For both divisions, we therefore anticipate a considerable decline in EBIT before special items.\n\nFor the Materials segment, we are forecasting slight sales growth in 2022. Despite the strong recovery in 2021, this will be largely attributable to further volume growth in both divisions. Increased inflationary pressures will be offset by efficiency gains. We anticipate lower prices due to a normalization of the market environment. EBIT before  special  items  in  the  Monomers  division  is  expected  to decrease considerably after strong margins in 2021 as a result of lower price levels and higher raw materials prices. In the Performance Materials division, by contrast, we anticipate a considerable increase in EBIT before special items due to the positive development of sales volumes. However, this will only be able to partly compensate for the decline in the Monomers division.\n\nWe expect sales in the Industrial Solutions segment to be slightly below the prior-year level. Higher volumes and continuing high price levels in both operating divisions will presumably not be able to completely offset the negative portfolio effects from the divestiture of the global pigments business as of June 30, 2021. We are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the Nutrition & Care segment, we expect considerable sales growth compared with 2021. We anticipate higher volumes in both divisions and higher price levels overall, primarily due to the passing on of higher raw materials prices and logistics and energy costs. This will be partly offset by portfolio effects from the sale of the production site in Kankakee, Illinois. The segment's EBIT before special items should be significantly above the prior-year level. We expect significantly higher earnings contributions from both divisions,  mainly due to higher margins on the back of strong volume growth.\n\nWe are forecasting considerable sales growth in the Agricultural Solutions segment. We will raise our sales prices and volumes in a continued challenging market environment, characterized by supply bottlenecks and high energy and raw materials prices. Based on the positive development of sales, we anticipate a strong improvement in EBIT before special items. In 2022, we will continue to invest in research and development and digitalization at a high level.\n\nSales in Other are expected to be slightly above the 2021 level in 2022. This will be mainly attributable to sales growth in commodity",

        "page_content": "## Opportunities and Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe goal of BASF's risk management is to identify and evaluate opportunities and risks as early as possible and to take appropriate measures in order to seize opportunities and limit risks. The aim is to avoid risks that pose a threat to BASF's continued existence and to make improved managerial decisions to create value. We define opportunities as potential successes that exceed our defined goals. We understand risk to be any event that can negatively impact the achievement of our short-term operational or long-term strategic goals.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Integrated process for opportunity and risk identification, assessment and reporting\n- /uni25AA Decentralized management of specific opportunities and risks: aggregate reporting at Group level\n- /uni25AA Material opportunities and risks for 2022 arise from overall economic developments and margin volatility\n\nIn order to effectively measure and manage identified opportunities and risks, we quantify these where appropriate in terms of probability and economic impact in the event they occur. Where possible, we use statistical methods to aggregate opportunities and risks into risk factors. In addition, we use a qualitative evaluation scale for opportunities and risks if quantification is not possible. This enables us to not only evaluate economic impact but sustainability-related aspects as well. In this way, we achieve an overall view of opportunities and risks allowing us to aggregate risks at Group level and take effective risk management measures.\n\n## Overall assessment\n\nFor 2022, we expect the overall economic recovery to continue and the coronavirus pandemic to weaken as the population becomes increasingly immunized. General economic uncertainty will neverthel  ess remain high. The course of the pandemic is difficult to predict; in particular, mutations of the coronavirus may lead to further waves of infection. This can result in production stoppages and supply chain disruptions in our customer industries, with our suppliers and in our own production plants. Moreover, restricted economic activity resulting from further lockdowns can have a significant  negative  impact  on  aggregate  demand.  In  addition,  an ongoing low supply of energy and raw materials and the resulting high prices could cause inflation rates to rise further. This could dampen the production of energy-intensive products and consumer demand beyond our assumed level of slowed growth.\n\nAn escalation of geopolitical conflicts as well as the ongoing trade conflicts between the United States and China and the associated slowdown of the economy also pose significant risks.\n\nOpportunities will arise from stronger demand growth, in particular from a greater reduction in pandemic-related risks than assumed by our forecasts. Rapidly increasing global vaccination rates and the approval of effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 could be contributing factors.\n\nIn addition to the uncertainties surrounding market growth and the development of key customer industries, material opportunities and risks for our earnings arise from margin volatility.\n\nAccording to our assessment, there continue to be no significant individual risks that pose a threat to the continued existence of the BASF/uni00A0Group. The same applies to the sum of individual risks, even in the case of a global economic crisis like the coronavirus crisis.\n\nUltimately, however, residual risks (net risks) remain in all entrepreneurial activities that cannot be ruled out, even by comprehensive risk management.\n\nAs a non-integral shareholding, income from Wintershall/uni00A0 Dea is reported in net income from shareholdings. The opportunities and risks resulting from the shareholding in Wintershall Dea are therefore not included in the outlook for the EBIT of the BASF/uni00A0Group. Opportunities and risks that have an impact on net income from shareholdings and cash flow from the shares in Wintershall Dea are monitored and tracked through BASF's involvement in the relevant govern ing  bodies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Corporate Finance and Corporate Development, which are units within the Corporate Center, and the Chief Compliance Officer coordinate the risk management process at a Group level, examine  financial  and  sustainability-related  opportunities  and risks, and provide the structure and appropriate methodology. Opportunity and risk management is thus integrated into the strategy, planning and budgeting processes.\n- - BASF's risk committee reviews the BASF/uni00A0Group's risk portfolio at least twice a year to evaluate any adjustments to risk-management measures and informs the Board of Executive Directors of these.  Members  of  the  risk  committee  are  the  president  of Corporate Finance, the president of Corporate Development, the president of Corporate Legal, Compliance/uni00A0& Insurance and the heads of the Corporate Audit, Corporate Environmental Protection, Health/uni00A0& Safety, Corporate Treasury, and Group Reporting/uni00A0& Performance Management units.\n- - The management of specific opportunities and risks is largely delegated to the divisions, the service and research units and the regions, and is steered at a regional or local level. This also applies to sustainability-related topics relevant to BASF including the impact of climate change on BASF. A network of risk managers in the divisions, service and research units as well as in the regions advances the implementation of appropriate risk management practices in daily operations. Financial risks are an exception. The management of liquidity, currency and interest rate risks is conducted in the Corporate Finance department. The management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof commodity price risks takes place in the Global Procurement unit or in authorized Group companies.\n\n- - The BASF/uni00A0Group's management is informed of short-term operational opportunities and risks that fall within an observation period of up to one year in the monthly management report produced by Corporate Finance. In addition, Corporate Finance provides information twice a year on the aggregated opportunity/risk exposure of the BASF/uni00A0Group. Furthermore, any arising individual risks which have an impact of more than \u20ac10/uni00A0 million on earnings or risks qualitatively evaluated to have a material impact, for example, reputational risks, must be reported immediately.\n- - As part of strategy development, the Corporate Development unit additionally conducts strategic opportunity/risk analyses with a 10-year assessment period. These analyses are annually reviewed as part of strategic controlling and are adapted if necessary. Scenarios were also developed to map possible developments beyond the ten-year horizon.\n- - BASF's  Chief  Compliance  Officer  (CCO)  manages  the  implementation of our Compliance Management System, supported by additional  compliance  officers  worldwide.  The  CCO  regularly reports to the Board of Executive Directors on the status of implementation as well as on any significant results and provides a status report to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee at least once a year, including any major developments. The Board of Executive Directors immediately informs the Audit Committee about significant incidents.\n- - The internal audit unit (Corporate Audit) is responsible for regularly auditing the risk management system established by the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section/uni00A091(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act. Furthermore, as part of its monitoring of the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board  considers  the  effectiveness  of  the  risk  management system. The suitability of the early detection system we set up for risks is evaluated by our external auditor.",

We also systematically assess opportunities and risks with effects that cannot yet be measured in monetary  terms,  such  as  reputational  and  climate  risks.  To reflect these, risks for companies in connection with the transition to a low-carbon economy (transition risks) as well as physical risks as defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), among others, were added to the catalog.\n- - Because global climate policy ambitions and the implementation of the relevant measures play a decisive role in the ongoing growth of the chemical industry and its customer industries, global longterm scenarios (up to 2050) with various global warming paths were defined. To assess the impact of different global climate policy approaches on our business units, the scenarios were discussed by the business units in workshops. Their feedback will be incorporated into the further development of scenario assumptions  and  outcomes.  A  dataset  of  scenario-specific macroeconomic parameters will be provided to test the economic feasibility of investments and business strategies.\n- For more information on our sustainability management processes, see page 45 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - We use standardized evaluation and reporting tools for the identification and assessment of risks. The aggregation of opportunities, risks and sensitivities at division and Group level using a Monte Carlo simulation helps us to identify effects and trends across the Group. We also aggregate qualitatively assessed risks at Group level using a risk portfolio.\n- - Our Group-wide Compliance Program aims to ensure adherence to legal regulations and the company's internal guidelines. Our global employee Code of Conduct firmly embeds these mandatory standards into everyday business. Members of the Board of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a The Corporate Audit unit is part of the Corporate Center.\n\nExecutive Directors are also expressly obligated to follow these principles.\n\n- For more information on our Group-wide Compliance Program, see page 171 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSignificant features of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the Group financial  reporting process\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared by a unit in the Corporate Finance department. The Consolidated Financial Statements are derived from the separate financial statements of the subsidiaries and joint operations, taking into account the relevant data for the joint ventures and associated companies accounted for using the equity method. The BASF/uni00A0Group's accounting process is based on a uniform accounting guideline that, alongside accounting policies based on the International Financial Reporting Standards\n\napplicable in the European Union, defines the significant processes and deadlines for the Group. There are binding directives for the internal reconciliations and other accounting operations within the Group. Standard software is used to carry out the accounting processes for the preparation of the individual financial statements as well as for the Consolidated Financial Statements. There are clear rules for the access rights of each participant in these processes.\n\nEmployees involved in the accounting and reporting process meet the qualitative requirements and participate in training on a regular basis. There is a clear assignment of responsibilities between the specialist units, companies and service units involved. We strictly adhere to the principles of segregation of duties and dual control, or the 'four-eyes principle.' Complex actuarial reports and evaluations are produced by specialized service providers or specially qualified employees.",

        "page_content": "An internal control system for financial reporting continuously monitors these principles. To this end, methods are provided to ensure that evaluation of the internal control system in financial reporting is structured and uniform across the BASF/uni00A0Group. They also work in accordance  with  the  international  risk  management  standard, COSO II Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework.\n\nMaterial risks for the BASF/uni00A0Group regarding a reliable control environment for proper financial reporting are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Risks are compiled into a central risk catalog.\n\nMoreover, a centralized selection process identifies companies that are exposed to particular risks, that are material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF/uni00A0 Group, or that provide service processes. The selection process is conducted annually. Persons responsible for implementing the requirements for an effective control  system  in  financial  reporting  are  appointed  at  the  relevant companies.\n\nThe process for identifying, evaluating, managing and controlling risks related to preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as monitoring these processes in the selected companies comprises the following steps:\n\n## -Evaluation of the control environment\n\nAdherence to internal and external guidelines that are relevant to the maintenance of a reliable control environment is checked by means of a standardized questionnaire.\n\n## -Identification and documentation of control activities\n\n- In order to mitigate the risks to the financial reporting processes listed in our central risk catalog, critical processes and control activities are documented.\n\n## -Assessment of control activities\n\nAfter documentation, a review is performed to verify whether the described controls are capable of adequately covering the risks. In the subsequent test phase, spot checks are carried out to test whether, in practice, the controls were executed as described and effective.\n\n## -Monitoring of control weaknesses\n\nThe responsible managers receive reports on any control weaknesses identified and their resolution; and an interdisciplinary committee investigates their relevance to the BASF/uni00A0Group. The Board  of  Executive  Directors  and  the  Audit  Committee  are informed if control weaknesses with a considerable impact on financial reporting are identified. Only after material control weaknesses have been resolved does the company's managing director confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system.\n\n## -Internal confirmation of the internal control system\n\nAll managing directors and chief financial officers of each consolidated Group company must confirm to the Board of Executive Directors of BASF/uni00A0SE every half-year and at the end of the annual cycle, in writing, that the internal control system is effective with regard to accounting and reporting.\n\n## Operational opportunities and risks\n\n## Market growth\n\nThe development of our sales markets is one of the strongest sources of opportunities and risks. For more details on our assumptions regarding short-term growth rates for the global economy, regions and key customer industries, such as the chemicals, automotive and construction sectors, see Economic Environment in 2022 on pages 145 to 147.\n\nWe also consider opportunities and risks caused by deviations in assumptions. Stronger demand resulting from faster eradication of the coronavirus pandemic, for example through sustained efficacy and growing acceptance of coronavirus vaccines and drugs, will give  rise  to  macroeconomic  opportunities.  A  significant  macroeconomic risk arises from the possibility that measures to contain the coronavirus are kept in place for a longer period of time or augmented, and, as a result, negatively affect global supply chains and slow global economic growth. Further increases in energy prices, caused, for example by an escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the resulting higher inflation rates for manufacturer and consumer prices also pose a risk to the economy. Additional\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmacroeconomic risks result from the escalation of other geopolitical conflicts and a renewed intensification of the trade conflict between the United States and China. Both can have a considerable impact on global demand for intermediate goods for industrial production and demand for investment goods.\n\nWeather-related influences can result in positive or negative effects on our business, particularly in the Agricultural Solutions segment.\n\n## Margins\n\nOpportunities and risks for the BASF/uni00A0 Group primarily result from higher or lower margins in the Chemicals and Materials segments. Opportunities arise here if the positive margin trend continues for longer than expected. However, further increases in energy and raw materials prices in particular, new capacities and raw materials shortages could increase margin pressure on a number of products and value chains. This would have a negative effect on our EBIT.\n\nMoreover, if oil and gas prices rise, Wintershall/uni00A0Dea does not have a compensating effect on the BASF/uni00A0 Group's EBIT because this shareholding is no longer reported in EBIT, but in net income from shareholdings.\n\nThe year's average oil price for Brent crude was $71 per barrel in 2021, compared with $42 per barrel in the previous year. For 2022, we anticipate an average oil price of $75 per barrel. We therefore expect price levels for the raw materials and petrochemical basic products that are important to our business to rise.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe continuously enhance our products and solutions in order to maintain competitive ability. We monitor the market and the competition, and try to take targeted advantage of opportunities and counter emerging risks with suitable measures. Aside from innovation, key components of our competitiveness are our ongoing cost management and continuous process optimization.",

        "page_content": "## Regulation/policy\n\nRisks for us can arise from intensified geopolitical tensions, new trade sanctions, stricter emissions limits for plants, and energy and climate laws. In addition, changes in chemical regulations can affect both the BASF/uni00A0Group's product portfolio and that of our customers, for example, on the use or registration of agrochemicals.\n\nPolitical measures could also give rise to opportunities. For example, we  view  measures  around  the  world  to  increase  energy  efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an opportunity for increased demand for our products, such as our insulation foams for buildings, catalysts, battery materials for electromobility, or our solutions for wind turbines. Our broad product portfolio enables us to, in some cases, offer alternatives if new chemicals have to be developed as a result of restrictions in connection with the REACH chemicals regulation or new standards in our customers' industries.\n\n## Procurement and supply chain\n\nWe minimize procurement risks through our broad portfolio, global purchasing activities and the purchase of raw materials on spot markets. If possible, we avoid procuring raw materials from a single supplier. When this cannot be avoided, we try to foster competition or we knowingly enter into this relationship and assess the consequences  of  potential  nondelivery.  We  continuously  monitor  the credit risk of important business partners.\n\nAround the world, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions (such as high/low water levels on rivers, heat/cold waves and hurricanes) are increasing as a result of climate change. We address the risk of supply interruptions on the procurement and sales side caused by extreme weather conditions by switching to alternative logistics carriers and the possibility of falling back on unaffected sites within our global Verbund.\n\nWe implemented a package of climate resilience measures for our Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, to address low water levels on the Rhine River: We developed an early warning system for low water, created multimodal transportation concepts, chartered more ships that can navigate low water levels and, in cooperation with\n\npartners, developed a special type of ship designed for extreme low-water situations. These measures are already making longer periods of low water on the Rhine River more manageable.\n\n## Investments and production\n\nWe try to prevent unscheduled plant shutdowns by adhering to high technical standards and by continuously improving our plants. We reduce the effects of an unscheduled shutdown on the supply of intermediate and end products through diversification within our global production Verbund.\n\nIn the event of a production outage - caused by an accident, for example - our global, regional or local emergency response plans and crisis management structures are engaged, depending on the impact scope. Every region has crisis management teams on a local and regional level. They not only coordinate the necessary emergency response measures, they also initiate immediate measures for damage control and resumption of normal operations as quickly as possible.\n\nCrisis management also includes dealing with extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes (for example, at the sites on the Gulf of Mexico in Freeport, Texas, and Geismar, Louisiana) or significantly elevated water temperatures in rivers due to extended heat waves, which limit the available cooling capacity (for example, at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany). Appropriate precautions are taken at the sites in the case of a potential change in risk in connection with climate change. For example, over the past few years, the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, has implemented several measures to increase cooling capacity, including expanding and optimizing the central recooling plants and optimizing cooling water flows. These are capable of preventing production outages due to extreme heatwaves.\n\nShort-term risks from investments can result from, for example, technical  malfunctions  or  schedule  and  budget  overruns.  We counter these risks with highly experienced project management and controlling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Acquisitions, divestitures and cooperations\n\nWe constantly monitor the market in order to identify possible acquisition targets and develop our portfolio appropriately. In addition, we collaborate with customers and partners to jointly develop new, competitive products and applications.\n\nOpportunities and risks arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures from the conclusion of a transaction, or it being completed earlier or later than expected. They relate to the regular earnings contributions gained or lost as well as the realization of gains or losses from divestitures if these deviate from our planning assumptions.\n\n- For more information on opportunities and risks from agreed transactions, see page 41\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Personnel\n\nDue to BASF's worldwide compensation principles, the development of personnel expenses is partly dependent on the amount of variable compensation, which is linked to the company's success, among other factors. The correlation between variable compensation and the success of the company has the effect of minimizing risk. Another factor is the development of interest rates for discounting pension obligations. Furthermore, changes to the legal environment of a particular country can have an impact on the development of personnel expenses for the BASF/uni00A0Group. For countries in which BASF  is  active,  relevant  developments  are  therefore  constantly monitored in order to recognize risks at an early stage and enable BASF to carry out suitable measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our compensation system, see page 102\n\nFor more information on risks from pension obligations, see page 157\n\n## Information technology risks\n\nBASF employs on a large number of IT systems. We use technologies such as big data and the Internet of Things to develop new business models, corporate concepts and strategies and to respond appropriately to changing customer behavior. IT system downtime, confidentiality  breaches  and  the  manipulation  of  data  stored in  critical IT systems and applications can all have a direct impact on production and logistics processes. The threat environment has changed in recent years, as attackers have become better",

        "page_content": "organized, use more sophisticated technology, and have far more resources available. If data are lost or manipulated, this can, for example, negatively affect plant availability, delivery quality or the accuracy of our financial reporting. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as personnel records or customer data, competitionrelated information or research results, can result in legal consequences or jeopardize our competitive position. This would also be accompanied by the associated loss of reputation.\n\nTo minimize such risks, BASF uses globally uniform processes and systems to ensure IT availability and IT security. These include stable and redundantly designed IT systems, backup processes, virus and access protection, encryption systems as well as integrated, Groupwide standardized IT infrastructure and applications. The systems used for information security are constantly tested, continuously updated, and expanded if necessary. In addition, our employees receive regular training on information and data protection. IT-related risk management is conducted using Group-wide regulations for organization and application, as well as an internal control system based on these regulations.\n\nThe Cyber Defense Center was established in 2015 and is continuously  being  expanded  in  line  with  the  growth  in  current requirements. BASF is also a member of Cyber Security Sharing and Analytics e.V. (CSSA) and a founding member of the German Cybersecurity Organization (DCSO) together with Allianz/uni00A0SE, Bayer/uni00A0 AG and Volkswagen AG. BASF has also established an information  security  management  system  and  is  internationally certified according to IDIN EN ISO/IEC 27001:2017.\n\n## Legal disputes and proceedings\n\nWe constantly monitor current and potential legal disputes and proceedings, and regularly report on these to the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board. In order to assess the risks from current legal disputes and proceedings and any potential need to recognize provisions, we prepare our own analyses and assessments of the circumstances and claims considered. In addition, in individual cases, we consider the results of comparable proceedings and, if needed, independent legal opinions. Risk assessment is\n\nparticularly based on estimates as to the probability of occurrence and the range of possible claims. These estimates are the result of close cooperation between the relevant operating and service units together with Corporate Finance and Corporate Legal. If sufficient probability of occurrence is identified, a provision is recognized accordingly for each proceeding. Should a provision be unnecessary, general risk management continues to assess whether these litigations nevertheless represent a risk for the BASF/uni00A0Group's EBIT.\n\nWe use our internal control system to limit risks from potential infringements of rights or laws. For example, we try to avoid patent and licensing disputes whenever possible through extensive clearance research. As part of our Group-wide Compliance Program, our employees receive regular training.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe recognized tax-related opportunities and risks only concern taxes that impact the BASF/uni00A0Group's EBIT in the short term. These arise when BASF has taken a position that differs from the opinion of a competent administrative authority. If a tax payment has already been made and could be reclaimed, this is presented as an opportunity. If, on the other hand, a potential payment is outstanding in accordance  with  the  administrative  opinion,  this  is  a  risk.  We primarily evaluate opportunities and risks with regard to their probability of occurrence and, if necessary, set up a provision for the relevant risk. If a provision is not necessary, this is taken into account in determining EBIT-relevant risks of the BASF/uni00A0Group.\n\n## Financial opportunities and risks\n\nDetailed guidelines and procedures exist for dealing with financial risks. Among other things, they provide for the segregation of financial instrument trading and back office functions.\n\nAs a part of risk management, activities in countries with transfer restrictions are continuously monitored. This includes, for example, regular  analysis  of  the  macroeconomic  and  legal  environment, shareholders' equity and the business models of the operating units.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe chief aim is the management of counterparty, transfer and currency risks for the BASF/uni00A0Group.\n\n## Exchange rate volatility\n\nOur competitiveness on global markets is influenced by fluctuations in exchange rates. For BASF's sales, opportunities and risks arise in particular when the U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates. A full-year appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by $0.01, which could result from a macroeconomic slowdown, would increase the BASF/uni00A0 Group's EBIT by around \u20ac30/uni00A0million, assuming other conditions remain the same. On the production side, we counter  exchange rate risks by producing in the respective currency zones.\n\nFinancial currency risks result from the translation of receivables, liabilities and other monetary items in accordance with IAS/uni00A021 at the closing rate into the functional currency of the respective Group company. In addition, we incorporate planned purchase and sales transactions in foreign currencies into our financial foreign currency risk management. These risks are hedged using derivative instruments, if necessary.\n\n## Interest rate risks\n\nInterest rate risks result from potential changes in prevailing market interest rates. These can cause a change in the fair value of fixedrate  instruments  and  fluctuations  in  the  interest  payments  for variable- rate financial instruments, which would positively or negatively affect earnings. To hedge these risks, interest rate swaps and combined interest rate and currency derivatives are used in individual cases.\n\nIn addition to market interest rates, BASF's financing costs are determined by the credit risk premiums to be paid. These are mainly influenced by our credit rating and the market conditions at the time of issue. In the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected from the possible effects on its interest result thanks to the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness.",

        "page_content": "## Risks from metal and raw materials trading\n\nIn the catalysts business, BASF employs commodity derivatives for precious metals and trades precious metals on behalf of third parties and on its own account. Appropriate commodity derivatives are also traded to optimize BASF's supply of refinery products, gas and other petrochemical raw materials. To address specific risks associated with these non-operating trades, we set and continuously monitor limits with regard to the type and volume of the deals concluded.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nRisks from fluctuating cash flows are recognized in a timely manner as part of our liquidity planning. We have access to extensive liquidity at any time thanks to our good ratings, our unrestricted access to the commercial paper market and committed bank credit lines. In the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected against potential refinancing risks by the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness as well as through diversification in various financial markets.\n\n## Risk of asset losses\n\nWe limit country-specific risks with measures based on internally determined  country  ratings,  which  are  continuously  updated  to reflect changing environment conditions. We selectively use investment guarantees to limit specific country-related risks. We lower credit risks for our financial investments by engaging in transactions only with banks with good credit ratings and by adhering to fixed limits. Creditworthiness is continuously monitored and the limits are adjusted accordingly. We reduce the risk of default on receivables by  continuously  monitoring  the  creditworthiness  and  payment behavior of our customers and by setting appropriate credit limits. Risks are also limited through the use of credit insurance and individual hedging strategies, such as guarantees. Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the BASF/uni00A0 Group, there are no major concentrations of credit default risk.\n\n## Impairment risks\n\nAsset impairment risk arises if the assumed interest rate in an impairment test increases, the predicted cash flows decline, or investment\n\nprojects are suspended. Following the impairments recognized in the third quarter of 2020, we currently consider the risk of further impairment  for  assets  such  as  property,  plant  and  equipment, goodwill, technologies and trademarks to be immaterial. The same applies to investments accounted for using the equity method, with the exception of Wintershall/uni00A0 Dea, which was remeasured at fair value in 2019. As the value of the shareholding is dependent on expected oil and gas price developments, impairments of the shareholding and of the assets held by the company are possible.\n\n## Long-term incentive program for senior executives\n\nSince 2020, BASF has offered its leaders the opportunity to participate in a long-term incentive program (LTI program) in the form or a performance share plan. The LTI plan incentivizes the achievement of strategic growth, profitability and sustainability targets and takes into account the development of the BASF share price and the dividend. The need for provisions for this program varies according to assumptions on the degree of strategic target achievement, the development of the BASF share price and the dividend. This leads to a corresponding increase or decrease in personnel costs.\n\nUntil 2020, BASF offered leaders the opportunity to participate in a share price-based compensation program. The need for provisions for this program varies according to the development of the BASF share price and the MSCI World Chemicals Index; this leads to a corresponding increase or decrease in personnel costs.\n\n## Risks from pension obligations\n\nMost employees are granted company pension benefits from either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. We predominantly finance company pension obligations externally through separate plan assets. This particularly includes BASF/uni00A0Pensionskasse VVaG and BASF/uni00A0 Pensionstreuhand e.V. in Germany, in addition to the large pension plans of our Group companies in North America, the United/uni00A0Kingdom and Switzerland. To address the risk of underfunding  due  to  market-related  fluctuations  in  plan  assets,  we  have investment strategies that align return and risk optimization to the structure of the pension obligations. Stress scenarios are also simulated regularly by means of portfolio analyses. An adjustment to the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninterest rates used in discounting pension obligations leads immediately to changes in equity. To limit the risks of changing financial market  conditions as well as demographic  developments, employees have, for a number of years now, been almost exclusively offered defined contribution plans for future years of service. Some  of  these  contribution  plans  include  minimum  interest guarantees. If the pension fund cannot generate this, it must be provided by the employer. A permanent continuation of the low interest rate environment could make it necessary to recognize pension obligations and plan assets for these plans as well.\n\n## Strategic opportunities and risks\n\n## Long-term demand development\n\nWe assume that growth in chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals)  will  be  about  as  strong  as  that  of  the  global  gross domestic product over the next five years and stronger than the five-year average prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Through our market-oriented  and  broad  portfolio,  which  we  will  continue  to strengthen in the years ahead through investments in new production capacities, research and development activities and acquisitions, we aim to achieve volume growth that slightly exceeds this market growth. Should global economic growth see unexpected, considerable deceleration because of prolonged restrictions due to  the  coronavirus  pandemic,  an  ongoing  weak  period  in  the emerging markets, protectionist tendencies or geopolitical crises, the expected growth rates could prove too ambitious.\n\nFor more information on the corporate strategy, see page 26 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Development of competitive and customer landscape\n\nWe expect competitors from Asia and the Middle East in particular to gain increasing significance in the years ahead. Furthermore, we predict that many producers in countries rich in raw materials will expand their value chains in consumer-oriented sectors. In addition, the proliferation of large-scale digital marketplaces for chemicals could impact existing customer and supplier relationships.",

We are therefore addressing these topics in research and investment programs for the sustainable transformation of BASF. Companies with a proven track record of providing more sustainable solutions will be able to achieve higher growth and profitability as a result. The expansion of sharing economy business models could have a long-term impact on demand in individual customer industries. At the same time, higher demands on product features can also create opportunities for innovation.\n\nTo maintain our competitiveness, we are continuously improving our production processes, streamlining our administration and simplifying workflows and processes as part of our excellence programs. Our research and business focus is on highly innovative businesses and differentiation through sustainability advantages to make our customers and BASF more successful.\n\nFor more information on the Excellence Program, see page 21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulation/policy\n\nWe expect to achieve continued regulatory and societal pressure, climate-neutral energy production, climate-neutral energy consumption, and a climate-neutral resource and raw material base. The political approaches to address these issues will vary greatly from region to region. However, based on Europe in particular, we expect measures with a high level of regulation and detail that will have the potential to significantly impact the competitiveness of BASF's opera tions and product portfolio.\n\nFurthermore, we see the risk of the current geopolitical shift in balance of power leading to the establishment of uncoordinated or divergent global legislative standards and regulatory systems, not just in relation to chemicals, but also to environmental, social and corporate governance criteria and the regulatory framework for digitalization.\n\nWe counter these risks as part of our corporate strategy. We explain our strategy in meetings with political decision-makers and social stakeholders. In doing so, we also inform ourselves of the changes we must undergo and advocate for a favorable and stable regulatory framework at both the national and international level. We consider BASF to be in a strong position to contribute solutions toward achieving U.N. development goals, particularly regarding climate neutrality, through new technologies, innovative products and processes and our broad product portfolio.\n\n## Innovation\n\nWe expect the trend toward increased sustainability requirements in our customer industries to continue. Our aim is to leverage the resulting opportunities in a growing market with even more sustainable innovations. The key areas are products with a lower or even net zero carbon footprint, circular economy solutions, and safe and sustainable products. To be successful in these fields, we have launched  specific  research  and  investment  programs  for  the sustainable transformation of BASF. Furthermore, we began applying the Sustainable Solution Steering method to the evaluation of innovation projects and integrated it at an early stage of our research and development processes. In this way, we are steering our innovation  portfolio  toward  increased  sustainability,  which  leads  to higher profitability while reducing reputational and financial risks as well.\n\nThere  are  technical  and  commercial  risks  of  failure  associated with  every  single  research  and  development  project.  We  also address this by maintaining a balanced and comprehensive project portfolio as well as through professional, milestone-based project management.\n\nFurther risks may arise from increasing state protectionism and the demand for localization of intellectual property in order to achieve technological independence. Through our Know-how Verbund in research and development, we ensure that critical intellectual property is generated and protected in countries with high intellectualproperty standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe expect that the digital disruption of established processes will lead to a sharp increase in efficiency and effectiveness in some fields. BASF is therefore committed to taking a leading role in the digital transformation of the chemical industry. Possible applications of digital technologies and solutions are evaluated along the entire value chain and implemented throughout the company, for example, in production, logistics, research and development, business models and corporate governance.\n\nFor more information on innovation, see page 49 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Procurement, supply chain and infrastructure\n\nSupply security for raw materials, energy and services is increasingly  affected  by  trade  disputes,  protectionism  and  geopolitical conflict. In addition, supply chains are increasingly threatened by disruptions such as suppliers' production bottlenecks, interrupted logistics  chains,  extreme  weather  events,  and  longer-lasting effects from the coronavirus pandemic. Climate change and extreme weather  events  are  impacting  the  availability  of  renewable resources.\n\nThese risks, as well as the introduction of new environmental regulations (for example, carbon fees), can have an impact on purchasing prices. Transportation costs are significantly affected by capacity constraints (for example, a lack of truck drivers, traffic jams due to inadequate logistics infrastructure).\n\nWe are seeing an ongoing expansion of the regulatory framework affecting us and our suppliers. Potential non-compliance by our suppliers may lead to a reduced supplier base. Moreover, the availability of renewable energies depends largely on favorable prices and framework conditions.\n\nThese risks are continuously analyzed and appropriate strategies and measures developed to minimize the impact on BASF.\n\nTo assess the changing risks for our sites from climate change, climate data based on the latest scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were compiled for our sites in cooperation with an external partner.

Here, we focus on a climate protection scenario, supplemented by two scenarios with medium and high levels of global warming. 1 The most common potential impact is an increase in heat and drought. The findings can be considered in the development of site strategies.\n\nThe availability of our infrastructure, production plants and supply chains can be negatively affected by system downtime, confiden tiality breaches, or manipulation of data in critical IT systems and applications. The threat environment has changed in recent years, as attackers have become better organized, use more sophisticated technology, and have far more resources available.\n\n## Portfolio development through investments\n\nWe expect growth in chemical production in emerging markets to remain above the global average in the years to come. This will create opportunities that we want to exploit by expanding our local presence. In addition, regional value chains help mitigate risks from trade conflicts and barriers that pose a challenge to global markets and supply chains.\n\nDecisions  on  the  type,  scope  and  location  of  our  investment projects  are  made  on  the  basis  of  established  comprehensive assessment processes. They take into account long-term forecasts for market, margin and cost development, raw material availability as well as country, currency, sustainability and technology risks. Opportunities and risks arise from potential deviations in actual developments from our assumptions.\n\nInvestments in more sustainable technologies represent a long-term opportunity, even though they may not be competitive or profitable in the short term, depending on the market and the prevailing regulatory framework.\n\nFor more information on our investment projects, see page 150 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Acquisitions, divestitures and cooperations\n\nIn the future, we will continue to expand and refine our portfolio through acquisitions that promise above-average profitable growth, are innovation-driven or offer a technological differentiation and help achieve a relevant market position, and make new, sustainable business models possible.\n\nThe evaluation of opportunities and risks plays a significant role during the assessment of acquisition targets. A detailed analysis and quantification is conducted as part of due diligence. Examples of risks include increased staff turnover, delayed realization of synergies,  or  the  assumption  of  obligations  that  were  not  precisely quantifiable in advance. If our expectations in this regard are not met, risks could arise, such as the need to impair intangible assets; however,  there  could  also  be  opportunities,  for  example,  from additional synergies.\n\nDivestitures also play a key role in the development of our portfolio. Risks could arise from divestitures as a result of potential warranty claims or other contractual obligations, such as long-term supply agreements.\n\nFor more information on our acquisitions and divestitures, see page 41\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Recruitment and long-term retention of qualified employees\n\nBASF anticipates growing challenges in attracting qualified employees in the medium and long term due to demographic change, especially in North America and Europe. As a result, there is an increased risk that job vacancies may not be filled, or only after a delay. We address these risks with measures to integrate diversity, employee and leadership development, and intensified employer branding. At local level, demographic management includes succession planning, knowledge management and offerings to improve the balance between personal and professional life, and promote healthy living. This increases BASF's appeal as an employer and retains our employees in the long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on individual initiatives and our targets, see page 97 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability\n\nOpportunities and risks that could arise from material sustainability topics can only rarely be measured in specific financial terms and have an impact on business activities, especially in the medium to long term.\n\nWe reduce potential risks in the areas of environmental protection, safety and security, health protection, product stewardship, compliance, supplier relationships and labor and social standards by setting ourselves globally uniform requirements. These sometimes go beyond local legal requirements. Our globally applicable Code of Conduct defines a binding framework for the activities of all BASF employees, leaders and members of the Board of Executive Directors. To ensure compliance with our internal standards, we have global management systems in place and monitor their implementation internally by means such as global surveys and audits. Expectations of suppliers are laid down in our global Supplier Code of Conduct. We have suppliers with a high potential sustainability risk evaluated by third parties, either through sustainability evaluations or on-site audits. The monitoring systems are complemented by grievance mechanisms such as our compliance hotlines.\n\nFurthermore, ongoing climate change poses both opportunities and risks for BASF. As an energy-intensive company, climate-related risks arise particularly from regulatory changes, such as in carbon prices through emissions trading systems, taxes or energy legislation. In addition, BASF's emissions footprint and intensity could lead to a negative perception and reduced appeal among external stakeholders such as customers or investors. We counter these risks with our carbon management measures and by transparently disclosing our positions on and contributions to climate protection (such as political demands, progress in the implementation of our climate strategy and how our products help to protect the environment) in publicly accessible sources (such as this annual report or on the BASF website) and in direct dialog with external stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Report\n\nCorporate governance refers to the entire system for managing and supervising a company. This includes its organization, values, corporate principles and guidelines as well as internal and external control and monitoring mechanisms. Effective and transparent corporate governance ensures that BASF is managed and supervised responsibly with a focus on value creation. It fosters the confidence of our investors, the financial markets, our customers and other business partners, employees, and the public in BASF.\n\nThe fundamental elements of BASF/uni00A0 SE's corporate governance system are: its two-tier system, with a transparent and effective separation  of  company  management  and  supervision  between BASF's Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board; the equal representation of shareholders and employees on the Supervisory Board; and the shareholders' rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Board of Executive Directors\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Responsible for company management and represents BASF/uni00A0SE in business with third parties\n- /uni25AA Sets goals and strategic direction\n- /uni25AA Strictly separate from the Supervisory Board\n\n## Direction and management by the Board of Executive Directors\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the management of the company, and represents BASF SE in business undertakings with third parties. BASF's Board of Executive Directors is strictly separated from the Supervisory Board, which monitors the Board of Executive  Directors'  activities  and  decides  on  its  composition. A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously be a member of the Supervisory Board. As the central duty\n\nof company management, the Board of Executive Directors agrees on the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF Group as well as its individual business areas; determines the company's internal organization; and decides on the composition of management on the levels below the Board. It also manages and monitors BASF  Group  business  by  planning  and  setting  the  corporate budget, allocating resources and management capacities, monitoring and making decisions on significant individual measures, and supervising operational management.\n\nThe Board's actions and decisions are geared toward the company's best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably increasing the company's value. Among the Board's responsibilities is the preparation of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements of BASF/uni00A0 SE and reporting on the company's financial and nonfinancial  performance.  Furthermore,  it  must  ensure  that  the company's  activities  comply  with  the  applicable  legislation  and regulatory requirements, as well as internal corporate directives. This includes the establishment of appropriate systems for control, compliance and risk management as well as establishing a company-wide compliance culture with undisputed standards.\n\nDecisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole by law, through the Board of Executive Directors' Rules of Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are made at regularly held Board meetings called by the chair of the Board of Executive Directors. Board decisions are based on detailed information and analyses provided by the business areas and specialist units, and, if deemed necessary, by external consultants. Board decisions can generally\n\nbe made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the casting vote is given by the chair of the Board. However, the chair of the Board does not have the right to veto the decisions of the Board of Executive Directors. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in their assigned areas of responsibility.\n\nThe Board can set up Board committees to consult and decide on individual issues such as proposed material acquisitions or divestitures; these must include at least three members of the Board of Executive Directors. For the preparation of important decisions, such  as  those  on  acquisitions,  divestitures,  investments  and personnel, the Board has various commissions at the level below the Board. Independently of the affected business area, these commissions carefully assess the planned measures and evaluate the associated opportunities and risks. Based on this information, they report and make recommendations to the Board.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory Board regularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all issues important to the company with regard to planning, business development, risk situation, risk management and compliance. Furthermore, the Board of Executive Directors coordinates the company's strategic orientation with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Statutes of BASF SE and the Supervisory Board have defined certain transactions that require the Board of Executive Directors to obtain the Supervisory Board's approval prior to their conclusion. Such cases include the acquisition and disposal of enterprises and\n\n<!-- image -->",

BASF aims to fill most Board positions with leaders from within the company. It is the task of the Board of Executive Directors to propose a sufficient number of suitable individuals to the Supervisory Board.\n\nBASF's long-term succession planning is guided by the corporate strategy.  It  is  based  on  systematic  management  development characterized by the following:\n\n- - Early identification of suitable leaders of different professional backgrounds, nationalities and genders\n- - Systematic  development  of  leaders  through  the  successful assumption of tasks with increasing responsibility, where possible in different business areas, regions and functions\n- - Desire to shape strategic and operational decisions, and proven success in doing so, as well as leadership skills, especially under challenging business conditions\n- - Role model function in putting corporate values into practice\n\nThe aim is to enable the Supervisory Board to ensure a reasonable level of diversity with respect to education and professional experience, cultural background, international representation, gender and age when appointing members of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\n## Two-tier management system of BASF/uni00A0SE\n\n## Board of Executive Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nappoints the Board of Executive Directors\n\nmonitors the Board of Executive Directors\n\nadvises the Board of Executive Directors\n\nreports to Supervisory Board\n\n6/uni00A0members appointed by the Supervisory Board Chair appointed by the Supervisory Board\n\nIrrespective of these individual criteria, a holistic approach will ultimately determine a person's suitability for appointment to the Board of Executive Directors of BASF/uni00A0 SE. Both systematic succession planning and the selection process aim to ensure that the Board of Executive Directors as a whole has the following profile, which serves as a diversity concept:\n\n- - Many years of management experience in scientific, technical and commercial fields\n- - International experience based on background and/or professional experience\n- - At least one female Board member\n- - A balanced age distribution to ensure the continuity of the Board's work and enable seamless succession planning\n\nThe first appointment of members of the Board of Executive Directors is for a term of no more than three years. The standard age limit for members of the Board of Executive Directors is 63.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12/uni00A0members\n\n6 shareholder representatives elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and 6 employee representatives\n\nChair elected by the Supervisory Board\n\nThe number of members on the Board of Executive Directors is determined by the Supervisory Board. It is guided by insights gained by BASF as a company with an integrated leadership culture and is determined by the needs arising from cooperation within the Board of Executive Directors. The Supervisory Board considers six to be an appropriate number of Board members given the current business composition, future responsibilities associated with development  and  the  fundamental  organizational  structure  of  the BASF/uni00A0Group.\n\nThe current composition of the Board of Executive Directors meets the  competence  profile  and  the  requirements  of  the  diversity concept in full.",

As members of the Supervisory Board may not simultaneously be on the Board of Executive Directors, a high level of autonomy is already structurally ensured with regard to the supervision of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nIn addition to the SE Council Regulation, the relevant legal basis for the size and composition of the Supervisory Board is provided by the Statutes of BASF/uni00A0 SE and the Agreement Concerning the Involvement of Employees in BASF/uni00A0 SE (Employee Participation Agreement),  which  also  includes  the  regulations  applicable  to BASF for implementing the statutory gender quota for the Supervisory Board. The German Codetermination Act does not apply to BASF/uni00A0SE as a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea, SE).\n\nThe Supervisory Board of BASF/uni00A0 SE comprises 12 members. Six members are elected by the shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Six members are elected by the BASF Europa Betriebs rat (BASF Works Council Europe), the European employee representation body of the BASF/uni00A0 Group. In accordance with the\n\nresolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June/uni00A018, 2020, the period of appointment for newly elected members of the Supervisory Board was reduced from five to four years; and the Statutes were amended accordingly. This ensures that the maximum membership duration of 12/uni00A0 years up to which a Supervisory Board member can be classified as independent corresponds to a total of three election terms. In accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code (Code 2020), the Supervisory Board reduced the membership duration used as a basis for its independence rating from 15 to 12 years in December/uni00A02019.\n\nThe meetings of the Supervisory Board and its four committees are called by their respective chairs and, independently, at the request of one of their members or the Board of Executive Directors. The shareholder and employee representatives of the Supervisory Board prepare for Supervisory Board meetings in separate preliminary discussions in each case. Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are passed by a simple majority vote of the participating members. In the event of a tie, the vote of the chair of the Supervisory Board, who must always be a shareholder representative, shall be the casting vote. This resolution process is also applicable for the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Executive Directors by the Supervisory Board. Resolutions can, as needed, also be made in writing or through communication outside of the meetings, as long as no Supervisory Board member objects to this form of passing a resolution.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors regularly informs the Supervisory Board about matters such as the course of business and expected developments,  the  financial  position  and  results  of  operations, corporate planning, the implementation of the corporate strategy, business  opportunities  and  risks,  as  well  as  risk  compliance management.  The  Supervisory  Board  has  embedded  the  main reporting requirements in an information policy.

On December 21, 2017, the Supervisory Board therefore agreed on objectives for the composition, the competence profile and the diversity concept of the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 5.4.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated February 7, 2017, and section 289f(2) no. 6 of the German  Commercial  Code  (HGB).  These  were  expanded  on December/uni00A0 19, 2019, in particular with respect to the criteria for assessing independence, based on the new recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, which was revised and amended in 2019 (2020 Code). The guiding principle for the composition of the Supervisory Board is to ensure qualified supervision and guidance for the Board of Executive Directors of BASF/uni00A0SE. For the election of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board, individuals shall be nominated to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting who can, based on their professional expertise and experience, integrity, commitment, independence and character, successfully perform the work of a supervisory board member at an international chemical company.\n\n## Competence profile\n\nThe following requirements and objectives are considered essential to the composition of the Supervisory Board as a collective body:\n\n- - Leadership experience in managing companies, associations and networks\n- - Members' collective knowledge of the chemical sector and the related value chains\n- - Appropriate knowledge within the body as a whole of finance, accounting, financial reporting, law and compliance as well as one independent member with accounting and auditing expertise ('financial expert') within the meaning of section 100(5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n- - At least one member with in-depth experience in innovation, research & development and technology\n- - At least one member with in-depth experience in digitalization, information technology, business models and start-ups\n- - At least one member with in-depth experience in human resources, society, communications and the media\n- - Specialist knowledge and experience in sectors outside of the chemical industry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the Supervisory Board's competence profile, see basf.com/competence-profile/supervisoryboard\n\n## Diversity concept\n\nThe Supervisory Board strives to achieve a reasonable level of diversity with respect to character, gender, international representation, professional background, specialist knowledge and experience as well as age distribution, and takes the following composition criteria into account:\n\n- - At least 30% women and 30% men\n- - At least 30% of members have international experience based on their background or professional experience\n- - At least 50% of members have different educational backgrounds and professional experience\n- - At least 30% under the age of 60\n\n## Further composition objectives\n\n- -Character and integrity: All members of the Supervisory Board must be personally reliable and have the knowledge and experience required to diligently and independently perform the work of a supervisory board member.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Availability: Each member of the Supervisory Board ensures that they invest the time needed to properly perform their role as a member of the Supervisory Board of BASF SE. The statutory limits on appointments to governing bodies and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code must be complied with when accepting further appointments.\n- -Age  limit  and  period  of  membership: Persons  who  have reached the age of 72 on the day of election by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting should generally not be nominated for election. Membership on the Supervisory Board should generally not exceed three regular statutory periods in office, which will correspond to 12/uni00A0years in the future.\n- -Independence: To ensure the independent monitoring and consultation of the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board should have an appropriate number of independent members on the board as a whole, and an appropriate number of independent shareholder representatives. The Supervisory Board deems this to be the case if more than half of the shareholder representatives and at least eight members of the Supervisory Board as a whole can be considered independent. The Supervisory Board's assessment of independence is based on the criteria in the current version of the German Corporate Governance Code (2020 Code). Among other things, this means that members of the Supervisory Board are no longer considered independent if they have been a member of the board for 12 years or longer. The Supervisory Board has additionally defined the following principles to clarify the meaning of independence: The independence of employee representatives is not compromised by their role as an employee representative or employment by BASF/uni00A0SE or a Group company. Prior membership of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF/uni00A0SE does not preclude independence following the expiry of the statutory cooling-off period of two years. Material transactions between a Supervisory Board member or a related party or undertaking of the Supervisory Board member on the one hand, and BASF/uni00A0 SE or a BASF/uni00A0 Group company on the other, exclude a member of the Supervisory Board from being qualified as independent. A material transaction is defined as one or more",

Furthermore, if a Supervisory Board member or a related party of a Supervisory Board member holds more than 20% of the shares in a company in which BASF/uni00A0SE is indirectly or directly the majority shareholder, the necessary independence is also not met.\n\n## Status of implementation\n\nAccording to the Supervisory Board's own assessment, its current composition  meets  all  of  the  requirements  of  the  competence profile: Nine (five shareholder representatives and four employee representatives) of the 12 current members are considered independent based on the above criteria. As of January 2020, shareholder representative Franz Fehrenbach is no longer classified as independent, because he has been a member of the Supervisory Board since January 2008 and no longer meets the criterion of a membership duration of less than 12/uni00A0years. Franz Fehrenbach will retire from the Supervisory Board on conclusion of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting  on  April/uni00A0 29,  2022.  Employee  representative  Denise Schellemans, who has also been a member of the Supervisory Board since January 2008, and employee representative Michael Vassiliadis, who has been a member of the Supervisory Board since August 2004, are likewise no longer considered independent.\n\n- For more information on the statutory minimum quotas for the number of women and men on the Supervisory Board, see the section after next on this page\n\nThe independent Supervisory Board members are named under Management and Supervisory Boards from page 175 onward\n\n- An overview of the fulfillment of the competence profile is available at basf.com/supervisoryboard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Compensation Report in accordance with section/uni00A0162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the assurance statement of the substantive and formal audit issued by the auditor, the effective compensation system for the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section/uni00A087a AktG, as well as the most recent resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on the compensation of the Supervisory Board in accordance with section/uni00A0 113(3) AktG have  been  made  publicly  available  on  the  BASF  website  at basf.com/compensationreport.\n\n## Commitments to promote the participation of women in leadership positions at BASF/uni00A0SE\n\nThe supervisory board of a publicly listed European stock corporation (SE) that is composed of the same number of shareholder and employee representatives must, according to section/uni00A017(2) of the SE Implementation Act, consist of at least 30% women and 30% men. Since the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Supervisory Board of BASF/uni00A0SE comprises four women, of whom two are shareholder representatives and two are employee representatives, and eight men. The Supervisory Board's composition meets the statutory requirements.\n\nAs a target figure for the Board of Executive Directors according to section 111(5) AktG, the Supervisory Board determined that for the target-attainment period under the German Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Management Positions (F\u00fcPoG I&II) from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021, the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE should continue to have at least one female member. This represented 12.5% on the date the target was set (based on eight members of the Board of Executive Directors). Following the entry into force of the German Second Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Management Positions (F\u00fcPoG/uni00A0II), if the management board of a listed company consists of more than three persons, at least one woman and one man must be members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the management board (section/uni00A076(3a) AktG). There have been two female Board members since the appointment of Dr. Melanie Maas-Brunner to the Board of Executive Directors, effective as of February/uni00A01, 2021. Since Wayne T. Smith's departure from the Board of Executive Directors on May/uni00A031, 2021, the proportion of women has been 33.3%.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors also decided on new target figures for the proportion of women in the two management levels below the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  of  BASF/uni00A0 SE:  For  the  second target-attainment period that ended on December/uni00A031, 2021, these targets were 12.1% for the proportion of women in the management level directly below the Board, and 7.3% for the level below that. This corresponded to the status at the time these target figures were determined. At the end of the concluded target-attainment period, women made up 20.0% of the management level directly below the Board and 23.2% of the level below that. Both targets were therefore  significantly  exceeded.  For  the  next  target-attainment period from January/uni00A01, 2022, to December/uni00A031, 2026, the Board of Executive Directors resolved as targets the quotas achieved as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021: 20.0% for the proportion of women in the management level directly below the Board and 23.2% for the level below that.\n\nBASF views the further development and promotion of women as a global duty independent of individual Group companies. It has committed to ambitious targets that were further raised in 2020. The new target is to increase the proportion of women in leadership worldwide to 30% by 2030. BASF will continue to work systematically on expanding the percentage of women in its leadership team. To achieve this, global measures will be implemented and enhanced continuously.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on women in leadership positions in the BASF/uni00A0Group worldwide, see page 99\n- For more information on the inclusion of diversity, including promotion of women, see the chapter on\n\nEmployees in the Management's Report on page 99\n\n- The November 2015 Employee Participation Agreement relevant to the composition of the Supervisory Board is available at basf.com/en/corporategovernance",

The Annual Shareholders' Meeting elects half of the members of the Supervisory Board and, in particular, resolves on the formal discharge of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, the distribution of profits, capital measures, the authorization of share buybacks, changes to the Statutes and the selection of the auditor.\n\nEach BASF SE share represents one vote. All of BASF SE's shares are registered shares. Shareholders are obliged to have themselves entered with their shares into the company share register and to provide the information necessary for registration in the share register according to the German Stock Corporation Act. There are no registration restrictions and there is no limit to the number of shares that can be registered to one shareholder. Only the persons listed in the share register are entitled to vote as shareholders. Listed shareholders may exercise their voting rights at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting either personally, through a representative of their choice or through  a  company-appointed  proxy  authorized  by  the  shareholders to vote according to their instructions. Individual instructions are only forwarded to the company on the morning of the day of the Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting.  Voting  rights  can  be  exercised according  to  shareholders'  instructions  by  company-appointed proxies until the beginning of the voting process during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. There are neither voting caps to limit the number of votes a shareholder may cast nor special voting rights. BASF has fully implemented the principle of 'one share, one vote.' All shareholders entered in the share register are entitled to participate in the Annual Shareholders' Meetings, to have their say con-\n\ncerning any item on the agenda and to request information about company issues insofar as this is necessary to make an informed judgment about the item on the agenda under discussion. Registered shareholders are also entitled to file motions pertaining to proposals for resolutions made by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and to contest resolutions of the Meeting and have them evaluated for their lawfulness in court. Shareholders who hold at least \u20ac500,000 of the company's share capital, a quota corresponding to 390,625 shares, are furthermore entitled to request that additional items be added to the agenda of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nDue to assembly restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting again took place virtually without the physical presence of shareholders in accordance with special regulations prescribed by the German Act on Measures in Corporate Law, the Law of Cooperatives, Associations and Foundations and Residential Property Law to Combat the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic (GesRuaCOVBekG), which was passed by the lower house of the German parliament (Bundestag) in March 2020 and extended until the end of 2021 with few amendments. To ensure legally compliant execution of this special Annual Shareholders' Meeting format, whereby shareholders participated solely via electronic communication, some of the aforementioned shareholder rights and options for action were limited or handled in an exceptional manner at this virtual meeting. After again being extended by the Bundestag, these special provisions are valid for Annual Shareholders' Meetings until August/uni00A031, 2022, as well.\n\n## Implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)\n\nBASF advocates responsible corporate governance that focuses on sustainably increasing the value of the company. BASF/uni00A0SE follows all of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated December/uni00A016, 2019 (Code 2020), the version in force on submission of the Declaration of Conformity. In\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe same manner, BASF follows all of the nonobligatory suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n- The joint Declaration of Conformity 2021 by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board of BASF/uni00A0SE is rendered on page 184\n- For more information on the Declaration of Conformity 2021, the implementation of the Code's suggestions and the German Corporate Governance Code, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Disclosures according to section/uni00A0315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and explanatory report of the Board of Executive Directors according to section/uni00A0176(1) sentence/uni00A01 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the subscribed capital of BASF SE was \u20ac1,175,652,728.32,  divided  into  918,478,694  registered  shares with no par value. Each share entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Restrictions on the right to vote or transfer shares do not exist. The same rights and duties apply to all shares. According to the Statutes, shareholders are not entitled to receive  share  certificates.  There  are  neither  different  classes  of shares nor shares with preferential voting rights (golden shares).\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Executive Directors is legally governed by the regulations in Article/uni00A039 of the SE Council Regulation, section/uni00A016 of the SE Implementation Act and sections/uni00A084 and 85 AktG as well as Article/uni00A07 of the Statutes of BASF/uni00A0SE. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board determines the number of members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least two), appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors, and can nominate a chair, as well as one or more vice chairs. The members of the Board of Executive Directors are appointed for a maximum of five years. The maximum initial term of appointment is three years. Reappointments are permissible. The Supervisory Board can dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if there is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in particular, a gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of Executive Directors and a vote  of  no  confidence  by  the  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments and dismissals according to its own best judgment.",

In the case of amendments to the Statutes, section 179(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act requires a majority of at least three-quarters of the subscribed capital represented. Pursuant to Article 12(6) of the Statutes of BASF SE, the Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve on amendments to the Statutes that merely concern their wording. This applies in particular to the adjustment of the share capital and the number of shares after the redemption of repurchased BASF shares and after an issue of shares from authorized capital.\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May/uni00A0 3, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase, until May 2, 2024, on a one-off basis or in portions on a number of occasions, the company's share capital by a total of up to \u20ac470 million by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in kind (authorized capital). A right to subscribe to the new shares shall be granted to shareholders.  This  can  also  be  achieved  by  a  credit  institution acquiring the new shares with the obligation to offer these to shareholders (indirect subscription right). The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to exclude the statutory subscription right of shareholders to a maximum amount of a total of 10% of share capital in certain exceptional cases that are defined in Article/uni00A0 5(8) of the BASF/uni00A0SE Statutes. This applies in particular if, for capital increases in return for cash contributions, the issue price of the new shares is not substantially lower than the stock market price of BASF shares and the total number of shares issued under this authorization does not exceed 10% of the shares currently in issue or, in eligible individual cases, to acquire companies or shares in companies in exchange for surrendering BASF shares.\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May/uni00A012, 2017, the share capital was increased conditionally by up to \u20ac117,565,184 by issuing up to 91,847,800 new shares. The\n\ncontingent capital increase serves to grant shares to the holders of convertible bonds or warrants attached to bonds with warrants of BASF SE or a subsidiary, which the Board of Executive Directors is authorized to issue up to May 11, 2022, by way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 12, 2017. A right to subscribe to the bonds shall be granted to shareholders. The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to exclude the shareholders' subscription right in certain exceptional cases - as defined in Article/uni00A05(9) of the BASF/uni00A0SE Statutes.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May/uni00A012, 2017, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to purchase up to 10% of the shares in issue at the time of the resolution (10% of the company's share capital) until May/uni00A011, 2022. At the discretion of the Board of Executive Directors, the purchase can take place on the stock exchange or by way of a public purchase offer directed to all shareholders. The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to sell the repurchased  company  shares  (a)  through  a  stock  exchange, (b) through a public offer directed to all shareholders and - with the approval of the Supervisory Board - to third parties, (c) for a cash payment that is not significantly lower than the stock exchange price at the time of sale and (d) for contributions in kind, particularly in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts of companies or shares in companies or in connection with mergers. In the cases specified under (c) and (d), the shareholders' subscription right is excluded. The Board of Executive Directors is furthermore authorized to retire the shares bought back and to reduce the share capital by the proportion of the share capital accounted for by the retired shares.\n\nBonds issued by BASF/uni00A0SE and its subsidiaries grant the bearer the right to request early repayment of the bonds at nominal value if, after the date of issue of the bond, one person - or several persons acting together - hold or acquire a volume of BASF/uni00A0SE shares that corresponds to more than 50% of the voting rights (change of control), and one of the rating agencies named in the bond's terms and conditions withdraws its rating of BASF/uni00A0SE or the bond, or reduces it to a noninvestment grade rating within 120 days of the change of control event.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn exceptional change of control compensation awarded to outgoing members of the Board of Executive Directors has not existed since January/uni00A01, 2020, as of the introduction of the amended compensation system for the Board of Executive Directors, which was approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June/uni00A018, 2020. The general rule for severance payments granted for premature terminations of appointments to the Board of Executive Directors applies, which states that the maximum severance payment may not exceed the amount of two years' compensation; however, this may not exceed the compensation for the remaining period of the contract.\n\nBy contrast, employees of BASF SE and its subsidiaries who are classed as senior executives will still receive a severance payment if their  contract  of  employment  is  terminated  by  BASF  within 18/uni00A0months of a change of control event, provided the employee has not given cause for the termination. The employee whose service contract has been terminated in such a case will receive a maximum severance payment of 1.5 times the annual salary (fixed component) depending on the number of months that have passed since the change of control event. A change of control is assumed when a shareholder informs BASF of a shareholding of at least 25% or the increase of such a holding. The remaining specifications stipulated in section 315a HGB refer to situations that are not applicable to BASF/uni00A0SE.\n\nFor more information on bonds issued by BASF/uni00A0SE, see basf.com/bonds\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors' and officers' liability insurance\n\nBASF SE has taken out liability insurance that covers the activities of members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board (directors' and officers' liability insurance). This policy provides for the level of deductibles for the Board of Executive Directors as prescribed by section 93(2) sentence 3 AktG (10% of damages up to 1.5 times the fixed annual compensation).",

Furthermore, the total volume of BASF/uni00A0SE shares and related financial instruments held by members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Super visory Board accounts for less than 1% of the shares issued by the company.\n\n## Share dealings of the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board\n\n(Obligatory reportable and publishable directors' dealings under Article 19(1) of the E.U. Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 (MAR))\n\nAs legally stipulated by Article 19(1) MAR, all members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board as well as certain members of their families are required to disclose the purchase or sale of financial instruments of BASF/uni00A0 SE (for example, shares, bonds, options, forward contracts, swaps) to the German Federal Financial  Supervisory  Authority  (Bundesanstalt  f\u00fcr  Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) and to the company if transactions within the calendar year exceed the threshold of \u20ac20,000.

KPMG member firms also audit the majority of BASF Group companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. KPMG has been the continuous auditor of BASF SE since the 2006 Financial Statements. A public call to tender was issued in 2015 to all auditors for the audit of the 2016 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, in line with the E.U. Regulation 537/2014 of April 16, 2014. Based on the results  of  the  tendering  process,  the  Audit  Committee  recommended to the Supervisory Board that it once again propose KPMG for  election.  Owing  to  the  German  Financial  Market  Integrity Strengthening Act (FISG), KPMG can only be proposed for election by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as BASF's auditor without further tendering processes up to and including the 2023 business year. Dr. Stephanie Dietz has been the auditor responsible for the Consolidated Financial Statements since auditing the 2020 Financial Statements.  Since  the  2020  Financial  Statements,  the  auditor responsible  for  the  Separate  Financial  Statements  has  been Dr./uni00A0Stephan Kaiser. The total fee paid to KPMG and auditing firms of the KPMG group by BASF SE and other BASF Group companies for non-audit services, in addition to the auditing fee, was \u20ac0.9/uni00A0million in 2021.

This has also been embedded in our values. We are convinced that compliance with these standards will play a key role in securing our company's long-term success. Our efforts are principally aimed at preventing violations from the outset.\n\nWe perform a systematic risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance violations, including corruption risks. These are conducted at divisional, regional and country levels, with an additional\n\nfocus on Group companies in 2021. The regular compliance audits performed by the Corporate Audit department are another source of information for the systematic identification of risks. These risks are documented in the relevant risk or audit report. The same applies to specific risk minimization measures as well as the time frame for their implementation.\n\nOne  key  element  in  the  prevention  of  compliance  violations  is compulsory training and workshops held as classroom or online courses. All employees are required within a prescribed time frame to take part in basic compliance training, refresher courses and special tutorials dealing with, for example, antitrust legislation, taxes or trade control regulations.

Our compliance standards were consolidated in the global Code of Conduct in 2013 and republished in June 2020 in our currently applicable global Code of Conduct. They are firmly established and recognized. We expect all employees to act in line with these compliance principles. Managers play a key role here they serve as an example of and communicate our values and culture both internally and externally. To specifically address compliance and integrity as a leadership task, a workshop series was held in 2021 with more than 130/uni00A0senior executives.\n\n## Monitoring adherence to our compliance principles\n\nBASF's Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and manages the further development of our global compliance organization and our Compliance Management System. The CCO is supported in this task by the Compliance unit and more than 100/uni00A0compliance officers worldwide in the regions and countries as well as in the divisions, service units and in the Corporate Center. Material compliance topics are regularly discussed in the compliance committees established at global  and  regional  level.  The  CCO  reports  to  the  Supervisory Board's Audit Committee in at least one of its meetings each year on the status of the Compliance Program as well as any major developments. In the event of significant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nWe particularly encourage our employees to actively and promptly seek guidance if in doubt. They can consult their supervisors, specialist departments, such as the Legal department, and company\n\ncompliance officers. The internal platform and the corresponding app also help employees to access advice by enabling direct contact. In addition, we have set up more than 50 external hotlines worldwide that our employees can use - including anonymously - to report  potential  violations  of  laws  or  company  guidelines.  We enhanced and standardized these hotlines in 2021. An independent external company was engaged to manage all hotlines. In the future, the cases reported will be recorded and processed in one global system. In addition to local phone numbers, a new website now also makes it possible to get in contact online using a computer or smartphone. All hotlines and the website are also open to the public. Each concern is documented according to specific criteria, properly investigated in line with standard internal procedures and answered as quickly as possible. The outcome of the investigation as well as any measures taken are documented accordingly and included in internal reports.\n\nIn 2021, 277 reports were received by our external hotlines (2020: 387). The information received related to all categories of our Code of Conduct, including environmental and human rights issues, corruption and handling of company property. We carefully investigated all cases of suspected misconduct that came to our attention and, when necessary, took countermeasures on a case-by-case basis. These included, for example, improved control mechanisms, additional informational and training measures, clarification and expansion  of  the  relevant  internal  regulations,  as  well  as  disciplinary measures as appropriate. Most of the justified cases related to personal misconduct in connection with the protection of company property, inappropriate handling of conflicts of interests or gifts and invitations. In such isolated cases, we took disciplinary measures in accordance with uniform internal standards and also pursued claims for damages where there were sufficient prospects of success. In 2021, violations of our Code of Conduct led to termination of employment in a total of 32/uni00A0cases (2020:/uni00A031). This relates to diverse employee groups, including executives.\n\nBASF's Corporate  Audit  department monitors  adherence  to compliance principles, covering all areas in which compliance violations could occur. They check that employees uphold regulations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand make sure that the established processes, procedures and monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient to minimize potential risks or preclude violations in the first place. In 2021, 77 audits of this kind were performed Group-wide (2020: 61). Our compliance management system itself is also regularly audited by the internal Corporate Audit department, most recently in November 2018. Overall, the audits confirmed the effectiveness of the compliance management system. In cooperation with an external consulting firm, we developed a comprehensive action plan in 2021 to ensure the systematic, continuous optimization of the compliance management system.\n\nWe monitor our business partners in sales for potential compliance risks based on the global Guideline on Business Partner Due Diligence using a checklist, a questionnaire and an internet-based analysis. The results are then documented. If business partners are not prepared to answer the questionnaire, we do not enter into a business relationship with them. A dedicated global Supplier Code of Conduct applies to our suppliers, which covers compliance with environmental, social and corporate governance standards, among other requirements. As part of our trade control processes, we also check whether persons, companies or organizations appear on sanction lists due to suspicious or illegal activities, and whether there are business processes with business partners from or in countries under embargo.\n\nWe support the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and are constantly working to enhance our internal guidelines  and  processes  in  keeping  with  these  principles.  For example, there is an internal guideline to respect international labor and social standards that is applicable throughout the Group. Outside of our company, too, we support respect for human rights and the fight against corruption. We are a founding member of the United Nations Global Compact. As a member of  Transparency International Deutschland and the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) of the World Economic Forum, we assist in the implementation of these organizations' objectives.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF's business developed extremely well in 2021. Growth and earnings were considerably higher than expected at the beginning of the year. The Board of Executive Directors decisively seized the opportunities that arose, strengthened BASF's overall competitiveness and laid important groundwork for the future. They did so in an  exceptionally challenging environment, including a sharp rise in raw materials and energy prices, strained conditions in many international supply chains, and problems with production and volumes in the automotive industry, which is particularly important for BASF. In addition, political tensions have increased and global economic activity has become even more demanding overall. Most of these factors will continue to challenge us in 2022.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors has enhanced and refined the portfolio and driven forward important investments for profitable growth. Above all, it defined ambitious targets to further reduce CO2 emissions at an early stage and presented a package of measures aimed at increasing sustainability in the BASF/uni00A0 Group. The underlying\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconditions vital to this, such as the European Green Deal and upcoming regulation of the chemical industry in the E.U., are currently difficult to assess and were the subject of in-depth discussion.\n\nThe Supervisory Board expressly supports this approach and is following it closely, both in an advisory capacity and through regular and critical monitoring. It would like to thank the Board of Executive Directors and all employees worldwide for their dedication, extraordinary work and outstanding results in the 2021 business year.\n\nWe will drive forward change in the Supervisory Board, too. Anke Sch\u00e4ferkordt, Franz Fehrenbach, Denise Schellemans, Waldemar Helber and Roland Strasser will resign from the Super visory Board on conclusion of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2022. As a result, its composition will once again change quite significantly compared with the start of the current term of office in 2019.\n\nUnfortunately, the new shareholder representatives will again not be able to be elected at a physical Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2022. The Supervisory Board deeply regrets this, as it believes that it is the ideal place to discuss BASF's development with you. However, after intensive consultation, the Supervisory Board concurred with the Board of Executive Directors' assessment that, from today's perspective, it will not be possible to hold a physical Annual Shareholders' Meeting in a responsible manner at the end of April this year given the current situation.\n\n## Monitoring and consultation in an ongoing dialog with the Board of Executive  Directors\n\nIn 2021, the Supervisory Board of BASF/uni00A0SE exercised its duties as required by law and the Statutes with the utmost care. It regularly monitored the management of the Board of Executive Directors and provided advice on the company's strategic development and important individual measures, about which the Supervisory Board was regularly and thoroughly informed by the Board of Executive Directors. This occurred both during and outside of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the form of written and oral reports on, for example, all of the major financial key performance indicators (KPIs) of the BASF Group and its segments, the economic situation in the main sales and procurement markets, and on deviations in business developments from original plans. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board tackled fundamental questions of corporate planning, including financial, investment, sales volumes and personnel planning, as well as measures for designing the future of research and",

        "page_content": "development. Regular topics of discussion were occupational and process safety and matters relating to sustainability, the environmental and social impact of the company's activities and the challenges of climate change for the future development of BASF's business. The Supervisory Board discussed in detail the reports from the Board of Executive Directors, and also deliberated on prospects for the company and its individual business areas with the Board of Executive Directors. It was convinced of the lawfulness, expediency and propriety of the Board of Executive Director's com pany  leadership.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors were also in regular contact outside of Supervisory Board meetings. The Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board  was  always  promptly  and  comprehensively informed of current developments and significant individual issues. The Supervisory Board was involved at an early stage in decisions of major importance. The Supervisory Board passed resolutions on all of those individual measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors which by law or the Statutes required the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nThe Supervisory Board held five meetings in the 2021 business year, each of which was attended by all members. The meetings were held in person with most Supervisory Board members physically present. Only at the meeting prior to the virtual Annual Shareholders' Meeting did the majority of members also participate virtually. The members of the Supervisory Board elected by shareholders and those elected by the employees prepared for the meetings in separate preliminary discussions in each case, which were also attended by members of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nAll members of the Board of Executive Directors attended the Supervisory Board meetings unless it was deemed appropriate that the Supervisory Board discuss individual topics - such as personnel matters relating to the Board of Executive Directors - without them being present. In addition, each Supervisory Board meeting includes an agenda item that provides an opportunity for discussion without the Board of  Executive Directors (executive session).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn individual overview of attendance at meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees will be made available on the company website at basf.com/supervisoryboard/meetings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA significant component of all Supervisory Board meetings was the Board of Executive Directors' reports on the current business situation with detailed information on sales and earnings development, as well as on opportunities and risks for business development, the status of important investment projects (current and planned), operational excellence, important aspects of economic, environmental and social sustainability, developments on the capital markets, significant managerial measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors, and innovation projects.\n\nIn all meetings held in 2021, the Supervisory Board also discussed the progress of major investments and ongoing portfolio projects. Discussions focused on:\n\n- - The development of the joint venture Wintershall Dea created by the merger of the oil and gas businesses of BASF and LetterOne\n- - The investment in a joint venture with Shanshan to produce battery materials in China\n- - The progress and opportunities and risks of the investment project to establish a new Verbund site in southern China\n- - The progress and completion of the sale of the pigments business\n\nImportant topics addressed by the Supervisory Board, which were discussed with the Board of Executive Directors at all meetings, were the effects, challenges and opportunities of climate change and, in particular, the European Green Deal and the resulting changes in the regulatory environment. The Supervisory Board is convinced that the successful  management  of  the  necessary,  fundamental  transformation  process, which affects all stages of the value chain, is key to BASF's future and long-term success, not least with regard to society's and investors' likely expectations. These topics were also the main focus of the Supervisory Board's strategy meeting in October  2021.\n\nAt its meeting on February/uni00A024, 2021, the Supervisory Board reviewed and approved the Consolidated Financial Statements, Management's Report and the proposal for the appropriation of profit for the 2020 business year as presented by the Board of Executive Directors. It also discussed the agenda for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2021, and adopted its proposals for resolutions. Since, due to the continuing effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Supervisory Board considered it impossible to hold a physical meeting, it agreed to again hold the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as a virtual event without the physical presence of shareholders. Other topics discussed at the meeting were business conditions and development as well as opportunities and risks for BASF's business in China, the world's largest",

Another topic was the shareholding in the Wintershall Dea joint venture.\n\nThe main agenda items at the meeting on July/uni00A022, 2021, were BASF's leadership development and personnel concept, the development and management of pension obligations, the development of the Global Business Services unit, and market opportunities and risks in connection with the European Green Deal.\n\nAt the strategy meeting on October/uni00A021/22, 2021, the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board discussed at length the status of implementation of the corporate strategy with a particular focus on growth, strengthening profitability and portfolio development, as well as key aspects of BASF's strategic development. These included:\n\n- - The development of research and development activities\n- - E-mobility and the transformation of the automotive industry as factors influencing the development of the BASF/uni00A0Group\n- - Market prospects and growth opportunities in China as the largest regional market for chemical products; growth projects such as the Verbund site in southern China and the further expansion of the battery materials business\n- - Climate change and the European Green Deal and their effects on BASF, as well as the resulting development paths, opportunities and risks\n- - The status, development and prospects of selected BASF business areas\n\nAt its meeting on December/uni00A016, 2021, the Supervisory Board discussed and  approved the Board of Executive Directors' operational and financial planning, including the investment budget for 2022, and, as in previous years, authorized the Board of Executive Directors to procure the necessary financing in 2022 within a set limit. In addition, the Supervisory Board discussed the Board of Executive Directors' recommendation that, given the uncertainty surrounding the further development of the coronavirus pandemic and potential restrictions, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2022, is also held as a virtual event. The Supervisory Board agreed to this following extensive deliberation and consideration of the resulting, unavoidable restrictions of shareholder rights compared with a physical meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compensation and composition of the Board of Executive Directors\n\nIn several meetings over the 2021 business year, the Supervisory Board discussed and passed resolutions on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors. Matters relating to the composition of the Board of Executive Directors did not arise in 2021.\n\nAt its meeting on February/uni00A024, 2021, the Supervisory Board deliberated and agreed on the 2021 targets for the Board of Executive Directors based on the preparations of the Personnel Committee. It also discussed and resolved on the final performance factors for the Board of Executive Directors' short-term and long-term incentives for 2020. At its meeting on December/uni00A016, 2021, the Supervisory Board evaluated, based on the discussions and the corresponding recommendation of the Personnel Committee, the Board of Executive Directors' performance in 2021 and set the performance factor for the short-term incentive 2021 and the strategic performance factors for the deferral compensation components for 2018-2021 and 2019-2022. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board abstained from the resolution on the factor for the performance bonus for 2018-2021 as this affected him personally.\n\n- For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see the Compensation Report, which has been made publicly available on the company's website at basf.com/compensationreport\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board of BASF/uni00A0 SE has four committees: 1. the committee for personnel matters of the Board of Executive Directors and the granting of loans in accordance with section/uni00A089(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Personnel Committee); 2. the Audit Committee; 3. the Nomination Committee; and 4. the Strategy Committee.

        "page_content": "The Personnel Committee met three times during the reporting period. All committee members attended all meetings. At its meeting on February/uni00A024, 2021, the Personnel Committee discussed the targets for the Board of Executive Directors for the 2021 business year and the 2020 Compensation Report. At its meeting on July/uni00A021, 2021, the Personnel Committee addressed the status of leadership development at the top levels of management below the Board of Executive Directors and long-term succession planning for the Board of Executive Directors. At its meeting on December/uni00A016, 2021, the Personnel Committee discussed the appropriateness of the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors, the assessment of the Board's performance in 2021 and a proposal for the performance-related variable compensation of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nThe Audit Committee met five times during the reporting period. All committee members attended all meetings. The Audit Committee is responsible for all the tasks listed in section/uni00A0107(3) sentence/uni00A02 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. The Audit Committee is also responsible for monitoring the internal process for identifying related party transactions and adopting resolutions to approve related party transactions.\n\nAt the meeting on February/uni00A022, 2022, the auditor reported in detail on its audits of BASF/uni00A0 SE's Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2021 business year, including the corresponding management's reports, and discussed the results of its audit with the Audit Committee. The committee's audit also included the Nonfinancial Statements of BASF/uni00A0SE and the BASF/uni00A0Group, as well as the Compensation Report of BASF/uni00A0SE in accordance with section/uni00A0162 AktG, which had been audited by the external auditor. In preparation for the audit of the Nonfinancial Statements, the Audit Committee had, following a corresponding resolution by the Supervisory Board, additionally engaged KPMG to perform a limited assurance and issue an assurance report on it. KPMG also reported in detail on the focus, the  procedure and the key findings of this audit.\n\nAt the meeting on July/uni00A021, 2021, the Audit Committee engaged KPMG/uni00A0AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft - the auditor elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A0 29, 2021 - with the audit for the 2021 reporting year and auditing fees were agreed upon. The focus areas and scope of the annual audit were discussed and defined together with the auditor. The Audit Committee excluded in principle the engage ment of the auditor to perform any services outside of the audit of the annual financial statements, including beyond prevailing legal limitations. For certain nonaudit services, the Audit Committee authorized the Board of Executive Directors to engage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKPMG for such services to a very limited extent, or granted approval in individual cases. At the meeting on December/uni00A015, 2021, the auditors responsible reported on the status of the annual audit, as well as the focus areas of the audit and the most important individual items. The Audit Committee also addressed the effects of the German Financial Market Integrity Strengthening Act on appointing KPMG as an  auditor in the future. Due to the change in the rules on auditor rotation, it is now possible to last appoint KPMG for the 2023 business year.\n\nOther important agenda items included providing guidance to the Board of Executive Directors on accounting issues, the control system established by the Board of Execu tive  Directors,  and  follow-up  assessments  of  acquisition  and  investment projects. At its meeting on April/uni00A027, 2021, the Audit Committee addressed risk manage ment in the BASF/uni00A0Group and the organization of internal environmental, health and safety audits. Its meetings on July/uni00A021, 2021, and December/uni00A015, 2021, focused on internal auditing and compliance, respectively. In these meetings, the head of the Corporate Audit department and the head of the Corporate Compliance unit reported to the Audit Committee and answered its questions. In all meetings, the Audit Committee also received information on the development of risks from litigation.\n\nThe Nomination Committee is responsible for preparing candidate proposals for the Supervisory Board members to be elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Nomination Committee is guided by the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board adopted by the Supervisory Board as well as the competence profile and diversity concept for the Supervisory Board resolved at the meeting on December 21, 2017. The Nomination Committee met twice in 2021. Both meetings were attended by all committee members. Items discussed at the meetings were the current competence profile and diversity concept for the Supervisory Board, the selection of candidates to succeed Franz Fehrenbach and Anke Sch\u00e4ferkordt, who had announced at an early stage that they would resign from the Supervisory Board on conclusion of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2022. In 2022, they will have been members of BASF's Supervisory Board for 14 and 12 years, respectively, meaning that both will no longer be independent within the meaning of the criteria of the German Corporate Governance Code and the criteria for the independence of Supervisory Board members set by the Supervisory Board. The committee identified successor candidates in a structured process and with external support, and evaluated them according to set criteria. Based on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board resolved on December/uni00A0 16, 2021, to propose Alessandra Genco, Chief Financial Officer of Leonardo SpA, and Prof. Dr. Stefan Asenkerschbaumer, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Management and Chief Financial Officer of Robert Bosch GmbH until",

Above and beyond this, the company also supports the members of the Supervisory Board with training for their activities on the Supervisory Board, whether through external offerings such as topic-specific seminars or internal information offerings such as site and plant visits.\n\nAt its meeting of December/uni00A0 16, 2021, the Supervisory Board approved the joint Declaration of Conformity by the Supervisory Board and the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section/uni00A0 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). BASF complies with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated December/uni00A016, 2019. The Corporate Governance Report provides extensive information on the BASF Group's corporate governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe full Declaration of Conformity is rendered on page 184 and is available to shareholders on the company website at\n\nbasf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independence and efficiency review\n\nAn important aspect of good corporate governance is the independence of Supervisory Board members and their freedom from conflicts of interest. The Supervisory Board based the assessment of the independence of its members on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code and the additional criteria for assessing the independence of Supervisory Board members contained in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, which were revised in the Supervisory Board meeting on December/uni00A019, 2019. The criteria used to assess independence are presented in the Corporate Governance Report on page 166. According to the Supervisory Board's assessment, on the basis of these criteria, five of the six shareholder representatives and four of the six employee representatives - 9 of the 12 members of the Supervisory Board in total - are considered to be independent as of the end of 2021. All three non-independent Supervisory Board members were classified as such due to the length of their membership on the Supervisory Board, which exceeds 12/uni00A0years in each case. Franz Fehrenbach and Denise Schellemans, two of the members to be classified as non-independent, will leave the Supervisory Board on conclusion of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2022; this increases the number of  independent members to 11 of 12 members. Above and beyond this, how ever, the Supervisory Board does not see any indications that the Supervisory Board role is not performed completely independently. In cases where Supervisory Board members hold supervisory or management positions at companies with which BASF has business relations, we see no impairment of their independence. The scope of these businesses is marginal and furthermore takes place under conditions similar to those of a third party.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the efficiency of its activities every year in the form of a self-assessment. To this end, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board conducted a written survey of all Supervisory Board members in the fourth quarter of 2021 on the basis of a detailed questionnaire covering the entire range of relevant Supervisory Board topics. These included, in particular, the preparation and conduct of Supervisory Board meetings, the content and topics of the meetings, cooperation within the Supervisory Board, and cooperation with the Board of Executive Directors and the auditor. The results of these dialogs, including suggestions to further improve the Supervisory Board's work, were presented by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board at the Supervisory Board meeting on December/uni00A016, 2021, and thoroughly discussed by the members of the Supervisory Board. Overall, its members again rated the Supervisory Board's activity as efficient.",

Material subjects were the organization and content of meetings, meeting documents and reports, participants and quality of discussion at meetings, and the implementation of the recommendations of the 2020 efficiency review. The Audit Committee discussed the results of the questionnaire and detailed suggestions at its meeting on December/uni00A0 15, 2021. On this basis, the members judged the Audit Committee's work to be efficient and appropriate.\n\n## Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements; Compensation Report\n\nKPMG/uni00A0AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, the auditor elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for the 2021 reporting year, has audited the Financial Statements of BASF/uni00A0 SE and the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, and the additional requirements that must be applied in accordance with section 315e(1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), including the Management's Report and the accounting records from which they were  prepared, and have approved them free of qualification. Furthermore, the auditor certified that the Board of Executive Directors had taken the measures incumbent on it under section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in an appropriate manner. In particular, it had instituted an appropriate early risk detection system that fulfilled the requirements of the company and is applicable for the early identification of developments that could pose a risk to the continued existence of the BASF/uni00A0Group. The results of the audit as well as the procedure and material findings of the audit of the financial statements are presented in the Auditor's Report.\n\nThe Auditor's Report is rendered from page 188 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the auditor, see the Corporate Governance Report on page 170\n\nBeyond the statutory audit of the Financial Statements, KPMG also conducted, on behalf of the Supervisory Board, a limited assurance of the Nonfinancial Statements (NFSs) for BASF/uni00A0SE and the BASF/uni00A0Group, which are integral parts of the respective management's reports. On the basis of its audit, KPMG did not raise any objections to reporting and the satisfaction of the relevant statutory  requirements. Above and beyond the statutory requirements, the auditor also  conducted a limited assurance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the  Compensation Report that is to be prepared by the Board of Executive  Directors and Supervisory Board in accordance with section/uni00A0162/uni00A0AktG.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The assurance report issued by KPMG on the substantive audit of the NFS can be found at basf.com/nfs-audit-2021 The assurance report issued by KPMG on the audit of the Compensation Report can be found at basf.com/compensationreport\n\nThe auditor's reports were sent in a timely manner to every member of the Super visory Board. The auditor attended the accounts review meeting of the Audit Committee on February/uni00A0 22, 2022, as well as the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board on February/uni00A023, 2022, and reported on the procedure and material findings of its audit, including the key audit matters described in the Auditor's Report. The auditor also provided the Supervisory Board with detailed explanations of the reports on the day before the accounts meeting.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the Financial Statements, the Management's Report and the Compensation Report at its meeting on February/uni00A0 22, 2022, including the reports prepared by the auditor and the key audit matters specified in the Auditor's Report, and discussed them in detail with the auditor. The chair of the Audit Committee gave a detailed  account of the preliminary review at the Supervisory Board meeting on February/uni00A023, 2022. On this basis, the Supervisory Board examined the Financial Statements and Management's Report of BASF/uni00A0SE for 2021, the proposal by the Board of Execu tive Directors for the appropriation of profit, and the Con solidated Financial Statements and Management's Report for 2021. The results of the preliminary review by the Audit Committee and the results of the Supervisory Board's own examination fully concur with those of the audit. The Supervisory Board sees no grounds for objection to the management or the reports submitted.\n\nAt its accounts meeting on February/uni00A023, 2022, the Supervisory Board approved the Financial Statements of BASF/uni00A0SE and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF/uni00A0Group prepared by the Board of Executive Directors, making the 2021 Financial Statements final. The Supervisory Board concurred with the proposal of the Board of Executive Directors regarding the appropriation of profit and the payment of a dividend of \u20ac3.40 per share.\n\nAlso at the meeting on February/uni00A023, 2022, the Supervisory Board discussed with the Board of Executive Directors the joint Compensation Report of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board in accordance with section/uni00A0 162 AktG and approved  it.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, we have audited the Group Management Report of BASF/uni00A0 SE for the financial year from January 1, 2021 to December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nIn accordance with German legal requirements we have not audited the  content  of  those  components  of  the  Group  Management Report specified in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report.\n\nThe Group Management Report contains cross-references which are not intended to use by law and are identified as unaudited. In accordance  with  the  German  legal  requirements  we  have  not audited the content of those cross-references and the related referenced information.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- - the accompanying  Consolidated Financial Statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and full IFRS and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2021, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, and\n- -  the accompanying Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this Group Management Report is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the Group Management Report does not cover the content of those parts of the Group Management Report specified in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report. The Group Management Report contains cross-references which are not legally required and are identified  as  unaudited.  Our  opinion  does  not  cover  those cross-references and the referenced information.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Basis for the Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No. 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer, IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German  professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

        "page_content": "## Recoverability of goodwill\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nFor information on the accounting principles applied, please refer to Note 1.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 204. The underlying assumptions used in the calculation and the disclosures on the impairment tests performed are included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 236 onward.\n\n## Financial statement risk\n\nIntangible  assets  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of BASF/uni00A0SE include goodwill in the amount of \u20ac7,520 million. Goodwill  accounts for 8.6% of total assets and thus has a material impact on the company's net assets. Goodwill must be tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired.\n\nGoodwill impairment testing is complex and is based on a range of discretionary assumptions. These include the forecasts for future cash inflows in the detailed planning period, the assumed growth rate for subsequent periods and the cost of capital. These assumptions have a material impact on the recoverability of goodwill. The growth forecasts of the Board of Executive Directors are associated with risks and can be revised in light of volatile raw materials prices and an instable macroeconomic environment.\n\nThere is the risk for the financial statements that an impairment as of the balance sheet date is not identified or that an impairment as of the balance sheet date is not recognized with an appropriate amount. In addition, there is also a risk that the disclosures in the Notes on the key assumptions are not appropriate and complete.\n\nWe consulted our valuation specialists in order to assess, among other things, the appropriateness of the key assumptions as well as the Group's methods of calculation.\n\nWe examined the forecast for the expected business and earnings development and the resulting cash flows in the detailed planning period, in particular with  respect to whether the expected development of the relevant sales markets were given appropriate consideration and are consistent with the current budgets adopted by the Board  of  Executive  Directors  and  the  Supervisory  Board.  We compared internal growth forecasts with industry expectations and those of significant competitors and we assessed whether assumptions contained in the planning regarding the future development of margins and the amount of investments are appropriate. Our review of the appropriateness of the budgets adopted by the Board of Execu tive Directors and the Supervisory Board also included a comparison of planning in past business years with the results actually  achieved.  For   selected  units,  we  examined  whether reasons for not reaching planned values in the past were given appropriate consideration in current planning, to the extent that this was relevant.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the assumed growth rate for the period following the detailed planning period on the basis of industry-specific and macroeconomic studies. We evaluated the methodological appropriateness of the calculation and the appropriateness of the weighted cost of capital rates. To this end, we calculated our own expected values for the assumptions and data underlying the weighted cost of capital rates and compared these with the assumptions and data used.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the Notes on the key assumptions are appropriate and complete.\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe assumptions and data underlying the calculations of the Board of Executive Directors are acceptable. The disclosures in the Notes on the key assumptions are appropriate and complete.\n\n## Recoverability of the shareholding in Wintershall Dea\n\nFor information on the accounting principles applied and the underlying assumptions used in the calculation, please refer to Note 10.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 227.\n\n## Financial statement risk\n\nIn the Consolidated Financial Statements of BASF SE, shares in Wintershall Dea in the amount of \u20ac9,583 million are reported under non-integral shareholdings accounted for using the equity method. The shareholding in Wintershall Dea accounts for 11% of total assets and thus has a material influence on the company's net assets.\n\nIf there are indicators for an impairment of an equity-accounted shareholding the company determines the recoverable amount as of the reporting date and compares this with the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the shareholding. The higher value in use determined for the shareholding as the recoverable amount is determined using the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount, this results in an impairment.",

        "page_content": "The determination of the recoverable amount of the shareholding in the Wintershall Dea is complex and based on discretionary assumptions. These include, in particular, the estimates made by BASF's Board of Executive Directors on the long-term development of oil and gas prices, the forecast production volumes of Wintershall Dea's oil and gas fields based on expected license terms and production profiles, and the cost of capital. The development of future oil and gas prices is subject to increased uncertainty, particularly in view of the timing of the implementation of international climate targets.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  impairments  and  reversals  of  impairments  of \u20ac161/uni00A0million after tax recognized by Wintershall Dea, as a result of the impairment test performed, the company recognized impairments of \u20ac420/uni00A0 million on fair value adjustments of assets of Wintershall Dea that  are  carried  forward  in  income  from  non-integral  companies accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThere is the risk for the financial statements that a decline in the value of the shareholding as of the balance sheet date was not identified. In addition, there is also the risk that the associated disclosures in the Notes are not appropriate and complete.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nFrom explanations provided by employees in accounting, we gained an understanding of the company's process to identify indicators for impairment and to determine the recoverable amount. In doing so, we assessed, among other things, whether the calculation of the recoverable amount of the shareholding in  Winters hall Dea is consistent with the relevant accounting principles and whether the key assumptions made in this calculation are  appropriate.\n\nWe discussed the projected development of production volumes and oil and gas prices with the persons responsible for planning. We evaluated the production profiles used in the measurement of the exploration and production business's assets, taking into account assessments by experts contracted by Wintershall Dea. In order to assess its suitability as a basis for calculation, we had the oil and gas price scenario used by the company explained to us. To assess its appropriateness, we compared the oil and gas price scenario used\n\nby BASF with the published forecasts of competitors, analysts, inter national institutions and other market participants. Due to the increased estimation uncertainties regarding future oil and gas price developments, we evaluated the impact of alternative price scenarios on the carrying amount of the shareholding and assessed the appropriateness of the valuation.\n\nIn  consultation  with  our  valuation  specialists,  we  furthermore satisfied ourselves of the methodological appropriateness of the calculation and the appropriateness of the weighted cost of capital rates. We compared the assumptions and data underlying the cost of capital, in particular the risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the beta factor, with our own assumptions and publicly available data.\n\nIn order to assess the accuracy of the measurement of the interest in Wintershall Dea, we reproduced selected calculations taking into account risk-based considerations.\n\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the Notes on the recoverability of the shareholding in Wintershall Dea are appropriate and complete.\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe underlying calculation method for the impairment test of the shareholding in Wintershall Dea is appropriate and consistent with the applicable accounting principles.\n\nThe company's assumptions and data underlying the measurement are appropriate. The associated disclosures in the notes are appropriate and complete.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following components of the Group Management Report, whose content was not audited:\n\n- - the information of the integrated non-financial statement which is identified as unaudited\n- - the corporate governance statement in the section Corporate Governance of the Group Management Report, and\n- - the disclosures which are not normally part of the Group Management Report and which are identified as unaudited.\n\nAdditionally, the other Information comprises the remaining parts of the BASF Report 2021.\n\nThe other information does not comprise the Consolidated Financial Statements, the audited parts of the Group Management Report and our auditor's report.\n\nOur opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn  connection  with  our  audit,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- - is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the Group Management Report information audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- - otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we conclude, based on the work we have conducted, that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are obligated to report on this fact. We do not have anything to report in this regard.",

In addition, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial  Statements  that  are  free  from  material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern.  In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the preparation of the Group Management Report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material  respects,  consistent  with  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In  addition, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for such  arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Group Management Report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements,  and  to  be  able  to  provide  sufficient  appropriate evidence for the  assertions in the Group Management Report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  Section/uni00A0317/uni00A0HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits  promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these Consolidated Financial Statements and this Group Management Report.\n\nWe  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n- - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the Group Management Report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Board of Executive Directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Executive Directors and related disclosures.\n- - Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  Board  of  Executive Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Group Management  Report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our  respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  present  the underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the  additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section/uni00A0315e (1) HGB and full IFRS.\n- - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the  financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.",

On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the Board of Executive Directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the  assumptions  used  as  a  basis.  There  is  a  substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nReport on the Assurance in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB  on  the  Electronic  Reproduction  of  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  the  Group  Management  Report Prepared for Publication Purposes\n\nWe  have  performed  assurance  work  in  accordance  with  Section/uni00A0 317/uni00A0 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the reproduction of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report (hereinafter the 'ESEF documents') contained in the file provided that can be downloaded by the issuer from the electronic client portal with access protection, 'basf-gruppe- 2021- 12- 31.zip'  (SHA256 hash value: 9cb0551f9c637 4988409b15ddd 8d688c5ff4b423a4708d1d2768a220841d4d3a) and  prepared  for  publication  purposes  complies  in  all  material respects with the require ments of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF format').

The Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report converted to ESEF format - including the versions to be published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) - are merely electronic  reproductions  of  the  audited  Consolidated  Financial Statements and the audited Group Management Report and do not replace them.

        "page_content": "## 1.3 Group accounting principles\n\nScope of consolidation: The scope of consolidation is based on the application of the standards IFRS/uni00A010 and 11.\n\nAccording to IFRS/uni00A010, a group consists of a parent entity and the subsidiaries  controlled  by  the  parent.  'Control'  of  an  investee assumes the simultaneous fulfillment of the following three criteria:\n\n- - The  parent  company  holds  decision-making  power  over  the relevant activities of the investee\n- - The  parent  company  has  rights  to  variable  returns  from  the investee\n- - The parent company can use its decision-making power to affect the variable returns\n\nBased  on  corporate  governance  structures  and  any  additional agreements, companies are analyzed for their relevant activities and variable returns, and the link between the variable returns and the extent to which their relevant activities could be influenced.\n\nAccording  to  IFRS/uni00A0 11,  which  regulates  the  accounting  of  joint arrangements, a distinction must be made between joint ventures and joint operations. In the case of a joint venture, the parties that have joint control of a legally independent company have rights to the net assets of that arrangement. In joint operations, the parties that have joint control have direct rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. This requirement is particularly fulfilled if the production output of the joint arrangement is almost entirely transferred to the partners, through which the partners guarantee the joint arrangements' ongoing financing.\n\nCompanies whose corporate governance structures classify them as joint arrangements are analyzed to determine if they meet the criteria for joint ventures or joint operations in accordance with IFRS/uni00A011. Should the arrangement be structured through a separate vehicle, its legal form, contractual arrangements and all other facts and circumstances are reviewed.\n\nIn addition to BASF/uni00A0 SE, the Consolidated Financial Statements include  all  material  subsidiaries  on  a  fully  consolidated  and  all material joint operations on a proportionally consolidated basis. Companies whose business is dormant or of low volume, and are of minor importance for the presentation of a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations, are not consolidated, but rather are reported under other shareholdings. These companies are carried at amortized cost and are written down in the case of an impairment. The aggregate assets and  equity of these companies amount to less than 1% of the corresponding value at Group level.\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the  equity  method  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. Associated companies are entities that are not subsidiaries, joint ventures or joint operations, and over whose operating and financial policies  significant  influence  can  be  exercised.  In  general,  this applies to companies in which BASF has an investment of between 20% and 50%. Associated companies and joint ventures that are fully or predominantly allocated to operating divisions are classified as integral because they are integrated into the value chain of the respective division; are controlled by the divisions; and they  generate their income in close cooperation with the other assets of the BASF Group and/or of these divisions. Equity-accounted income from integral joint ventures or associated companies is reported as part of income from operations (EBIT).\n\nEquity-accounted  income  from  non-integral  joint  ventures  or associated companies is reported in net income from shareholdings.\n\n- For more information, see Note/uni00A010 from page 225 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsolidation  methods: Assets  and  liabilities  of  consolidated companies are uniformly recognized and measured in accordance with the principles described herein. For companies accounted for using  the  equity  method,  material  deviations  in  measurement resulting from the application of other accounting principles are adjusted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransactions between  consolidated  companies  as  well  as intercompany  profits  resulting  from  trade  between  consolidated companies are eliminated in full. Sales and material other balances and transactions between joint operations and fully consolidated Group companies are also eliminated. Material intercompany profits related to companies accounted for using the equity method are eliminated.\n\nCapital consolidation is conducted at the acquisition date according to the purchase method. Initially, all assets, liabilities and additional intangible assets that are to be capitalized are measured at fair value regardless of the scope of any noncontrolling interests. Subsequently, the cost of acquiring the company is compared with the proportional share of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The resulting positive differences are capitalized as goodwill. Negative differences are reviewed once more, then recognized directly in the income statement.\n\nNoncontrolling interests are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition  proportional  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method).\n\nThe incidental acquisition costs of a business combination are recognized  in  the  income  statement  under  other  operating expenses.\n\nFor more information, see Note/uni00A013 on page 235\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Foreign  currency  translation: The  cost  of  assets  acquired  in foreign currencies and revenue from sales in foreign currencies are determined by the exchange rate on the date the transaction is recognized. Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are valued at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Changes in assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency translation are recognized in the income statement and reported under other operating income or expenses, other financial result, and in the case of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, in other comprehensive income.\n\nTranslation  of  foreign  currency  financial  statements: The translation of foreign currency financial statements depends on the functional currency of the consolidated companies. For companies whose  functional  currency  is  not  the  euro,  translation  into  the reporting currency is based on the closing rate method: Balance sheet items are translated into euros using closing rates on the balance sheet date; expenses and income are translated into euros at  monthly  average  rates  and  accumulated  for  the  year.  The difference between a company's translated equity at historical rates at the time of acquisition or retention and its equity at closing rates on the balance sheet date is reported under other comprehensive income (translation adjustments) and is recognized in the income statement only upon the company's disposal.\n\nFor certain companies outside the eurozone or U.S. dollar zone, the euro or U.S. dollar is the functional currency. In such cases,  financial statements prepared in the local currency are translated into the functional currency using the temporal method: All nonmonetary assets and related depreciation and amortization as well as equity are translated at the exchange rate applying to the respective transactions. All other balance sheet items are translated using  closing rates on the balance sheet date; other expenses and income are translated at monthly average rates. The resulting translation differences are recognized in the income statement under other operating income or expenses. If necessary, financial statements in the functional currency are translated into the presentation currency according to the closing rate method.\n\n## Selected exchange rates\n\nEUR/uni00A01 equals\n\n|                      | Closing rates         | Closing rates         | Average rates   | Average rates   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                      | Dec./uni00A031,  2021 | Dec./uni00A031,  2020 | 2021            | 2020            |\n| Brazil (BRL)         | 6.31                  | 6.37                  | 6.38            | 5.89            |\n| China (CNY)          | 7.19                  | 8.02                  | 7.63            | 7.87            |\n| United Kingdom (GBP) | 0.84                  | 0.90                  | 0.86            | 0.89            |\n| Japan (JPY)          | 130.38                | 126.49                | 129.88          | 121.85          |\n| Malaysia (MYR)       | 4.72                  | 4.93                  | 4.90            | 4.80            |\n| Mexico (MXN)         | 23.14                 | 24.42                 | 23.99           | 24.52           |\n| Norway (NOK)         | 9.99                  | 10.47                 | 10.16           | 10.72           |\n| Russia (RUB)         | 85.30                 | 91.47                 | 87.15           | 82.72           |\n| Switzerland (CHF)    | 1.03                  | 1.08                  | 1.08            | 1.07            |\n| South Korea (KRW)    | 1,346.38              | 1,336.00              | 1,354.06        | 1,345.58        |\n| United States (USD)  | 1.13                  | 1.23                  | 1.18            | 1.14            |\n\n## 1.4 Accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies for the individual items in the Balance Sheet and  the  Statement  of  Income  are  presented  in  the  respective sections of the Notes.\n\nBusiness combinations: In business combinations, the acquired assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on the date the acquirer effectively obtains control. The fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition, as well as the useful lives of the acquired assets, are largely based on projected cash flows. Actual cash flows can deviate significantly from those. Independent external appraisals are typically used for the purchase price allocation of material business combinations. Valuations in the course of business combinations are based on existing information as of the acquisition date.\n\n## Groups of assets and liabilities held for sale (disposal groups):\n\nThese  comprise  those  assets  and  directly  associated  liabilities shown separately on the balance sheet whose sale in the context of a single transaction is highly probable. A transaction is assumed to be highly probable if there are no significant risks of completion of the transaction, which usually requires the conclusion of binding\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontracts. The assets and liabilities of disposal groups are recognized at the lower of the sum of their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell; this does not apply to assets that do not fall under the valuation principles of IFRS/uni00A05. Depreciation of noncurrent assets and the use of the equity method are suspended.\n\nDiscontinued operations: These are classified as held for sale and are presented as discontinued operations in BASF's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS/uni00A05. Until closing, the income after taxes of discontinued operations is shown in income after taxes of the BASF Group as a separate item (income after taxes from discontinued operations). In addition, the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations are reclassified to a  disposal group (assets or liabilities of disposal groups). The statement of cash flows is not adjusted. The activities of discontinued operations are not allocated to any reportable segment in financial reporting.\n\nFor more information, see Note/uni00A03 from page 207 onward and Note/uni00A05 from page 213 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe carrying amount of assets, liabilities and provisions, contingent liabilities and other financial obligations reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements depends on the use of estimates, assumptions and discretionary scope. Specific estimates or assumptions used in individual accounting or valuation methods are disclosed in their respective  sections  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements. They are based on the circumstances and estimates on the balance sheet date and thus affect the amounts of income and expenses  shown  for  the  reporting  periods  presented.  These assumptions primarily relate to the determination of discounted cash flows in the context of impairment tests and purchase price allocations;  the  useful  lives  of  depreciable  property,  plant  and equipment  and  intangible  assets;  the  carrying  amount  of shareholdings; and the measurement of provisions for items such as employee  benefits,  warranties,  trade  discounts,  environmental protection and  taxes.  Although  uncertainty  is  appropriately incorporated in the valuation factors, actual results can differ from these estimates.\n\nImpairment  tests on  assets  are  carried  out  whenever  certain triggering events indicate potential impairment. External triggering events  include,  for  example,  changes  in  customer  industries, technologies  used  and  economic  downturns.  Internal  triggering events for an impairment test include lower product profitability, planned  restructuring  measures  or  physical  damage  to  assets. Impairment tests entail a comparison of the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. As a rule, value in use is determined using the discounted cash flow method. The estimation of cash flows and the assumptions used consider all information available  on  the  respective  balance  sheet  date  on  the  future development of the operating business. Actual future developments may vary. Impairment testing relies upon the cash-generating unit's long-term earnings forecasts, which are based on macroeconomic trends. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the capital asset pricing model plays an important role in impairment\n\ntesting. It comprises a risk-free interest rate, the market risk  premium and  an  industry-specific  spread  for  the  credit  risk.  Additional important assumptions are the forecasts for the detailed planning period and the terminal growth rates used. Fair value less costs to sell must be determined for the impairment test of disposal groups; specific assumptions relating to the respective transaction must be made for this determination.\n\n- For more information, see Note/uni00A03 from page 207 onward and Note/uni00A014 from page 236 onward\n\nAn impairment is recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The impaired asset (excluding goodwill) is written down by the amount of the difference between these amounts.\n\nThe goodwill impairment test is based on cash-generating units. At BASF, these largely correspond to the business units, or in  individual cases the divisions. If there is a need for impairment, the existing goodwill is, if necessary, completely written off as a first step. If there is further need for impairment, this is allocated to the remaining assets  of  the  cash-generating  unit.  Goodwill  impairments  are reported under other operating expenses.\n\nClimate and sustainability-related developments: The chemical industry  is  resource-intensive.  BASF  is  committed  to  the  Paris Climate Agreement: Using resources as efficiently and responsibly as  possible  and  the  concept  of  a  circular  economy  are  firmly embedded in BASF's strategy and its actions, supported by the Verbund structure, clearly defined ambitious targets for reducing CO2, and the use of renewable and recycled feedstocks. BASF always strives to employ raw materials more efficiently and improve production processes as well as to continuously seek ways to use non-fossil,  renewable  or  recycled  feedstocks.  For  this  reason, current developments and measures relating to climate change and sustainability do not lead to fundamentally changed expectations with  regard  to  useful  lives  or  recoverability  of  the  majority  of noncurrent assets. There is also no material need for adjustments to provisions for environmental and restoration obligations. In individual cases, however, plants may be shut down if necessary for reasons of  environmental protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate  policies  are  also  causing  fundamental  changes  in  the automotive industry, one of BASF's key customer industries. The transition to electromobility will have a long-term negative impact on  the  emissions  catalyst  business.  This  development  was accounted for in the adjustment of the growth rate for the goodwill impairment test and did not lead to an impairment. Other BASF businesses  will  benefit  from  this  transformation;  for  example, demand for innovative lightweight materials and battery materials will grow. Furthermore, climate policies can influence the business of oil and gas producers such as Wintershall Dea, which BASF accounts for using the equity method. Nevertheless, given the large share of gas in Wintershall Dea's production and reserves as well as the acceptance of gas as a bridge technology, it can be assumed that  these  assets  are  fundamentally  recoverable.  The  price assumptions  applied  for  the  impairment  test  reflected  current developments regarding climate neutrality as well as a possible oil and gas shortage due to lack of investment in this industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on climate and sustainability, see Wintershall Dea's annual report at wintershalldea.com/en/investor-relations",

        "page_content": "## 3 Acquisitions and divestitures\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn 2021, BASF acquired the following activity:\n\n- - Since August/uni00A031, 2021, BASF and Shanshan, a lithium-ion  battery materials provider in China, have held shares in BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd. The company is majority-owned by BASF (BASF 51%; Shanshan 49%). It already occupies a very strong position in the value chain for battery materials including raw materials, precursors for cathode active materials, cathode active materials and battery recycling. It focuses primarily on the electric vehicle market as well as the consumer electronics and energy  storage  segments.  Through  this  investment,  BASF  is further strengthening its position in Asia to create an integrated global supply chain for battery materials for customers in China and worldwide. The investment strengthens the Catalysts  division. The  transaction  includes  four  companies  and  approximately 1,600  employees.  One  of  the  companies  is  classified  as  an investment  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method,  but  for reasons  of  materiality,  was  consolidated  in  BASF's  financial statements at amortized cost. The purchase price was  \u20ac616/uni00A0million and was cash-effective in full. A separate transaction valued at \u20ac36 million was connected to the purchase in accordance with IFRS 3.51 and was reported under other receivables. It contains a compensation  component  which  is  coupled  with  employees remaining at BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd.  It affects a period of one to two years and will be disbursed in two  tranches. Goodwill of \u20ac254/uni00A0million resulted in particular from sales and cost synergies. The businesses acquired accounted for \u20ac354/uni00A0million in sales revenue and -\u20ac36/uni00A0million in income from operations in the 2021 fiscal year. Including the businesses and assets of the BASF Shanshan companies in BASF's Consolidated Financial Statements since January/uni00A0 1, 2021, would have resulted in a sales revenue contribution of \u20ac821 million and income from operations of \u20ac13 million. These pro forma data are for comparison  purposes. They are not necessarily values that would have resulted had the transaction taken place as of January/uni00A0 1,/uni00A0 2021, and are not\n\nsuitable  for  forecasting  future  developments  or  events.  The goodwill is not tax deductible.\n\nThe following table shows the fair values for the assets and liabilities of the BASF Shanshan companies, which were used on a  preliminary basis until a complete independent valuation is carried out. The purchase price allocation considers all the facts and circumstances prevailing as of the date of acquisition that were known prior to the preparation  of  these  financial  statements.  If  further  facts  and circumstances become known within the 12-month valuation period pursuant to IFRS 3, the purchase price allocation will be recalculated accordingly.\n\nThe gross amounts of contractual trade accounts receivable were \u20ac290/uni00A0 million, of which \u20ac52/uni00A0 million is expected to be uncollectible. The gross amounts of Other receivables were \u20ac160/uni00A0million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Preliminary purchase price allocation for the acquisition of assets and liabilities of the BASF Shanshan companies\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                | Fair value as of  date of  acquisition   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Goodwill                                                       | 254                                      |\n| Other intangible assets                                        | 139                                      |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                  | 332                                      |\n| Integral investments accounted for using the equity method     | -                                        |\n| Non-integral investments accounted for using the equity method | -                                        |\n| Other financial assets                                         | 8                                        |\n| Deferred tax assets                                            | 11                                       |\n| Other receivables and miscellaneous assets                     | -                                        |\n| Noncurrent assets                                              | 744                                      |\n| Inventories                                                    | 207                                      |\n| Accounts receivable, trade                                     | 238                                      |\n| Other receivables and miscellaneous assets                     | 160                                      |\n| Marketable securities                                          | -                                        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                      | 52                                       |\n| Current assets                                                 | 657                                      |\n| Total assets                                                   | 1,401                                    |\n| Provisions for pensions and similar obligations                | -                                        |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                       | 32                                       |\n| Tax provisions                                                 | 2                                        |\n| Other provisions                                               | 18                                       |\n| Financial indebtedness                                         | 5                                        |\n| Other liabilities                                              | 8                                        |\n| Noncurrent liabilities                                         | 65                                       |\n| Accounts payable, trade                                        | 262                                      |\n| Provisions                                                     | 2                                        |\n| Tax liabilities                                                | 1                                        |\n| Financial indebtedness                                         | 91                                       |\n| Other liabilities                                              | 15                                       |\n| Current liabilities                                            | 371                                      |\n| Total liabilities                                              | 436                                      |\n| Noncontrolling interests                                       | 348                                      |\n| Total purchase price                                           | 616                                      |",

The transaction is not being reported as an acquisition because the acquired assets do not constitute a business in accordance with IFRS 3.2b, so it is not within the IFRS/uni00A03 scope of application. The transaction is therefore not included in the table to the right.\n\n## In 2020, BASF acquired the following activity:\n\n- - BASF  closed  the  acquisition  of  Solvay's  polyamide  business (PA/uni00A06.6) on January/uni00A031, 2020. Domo Chemicals, Leuna,  Germany, was approved by the E.U. Commission as the buyer of the European polyamide business, which could not be acquired by BASF under the conditions imposed by the authorities. The transaction broadened BASF's polyamide capabilities with  innovative products. It also enhanced the company's access to growth markets in Asia as well as in North and South America. Through backward integration into the key raw material adiponi trile (ADN), BASF was integrated along the entire polyamide 6.6 value chain and was able to improve supply reliability. The  purchase price of the business acquired by BASF was  \u20ac1,319/uni00A0million on a cash and debt-free basis. Of that amount, \u20ac1,308 million was already cash effective in 2020. The remaining purchase price should be paid in 2022. The business was integrated into the Performance  Materials and Monomers divisions. The transaction between Solvay and BASF included eight production sites in Germany, France, China, India, South Korea, Brazil and Mexico, as well as research and development and technical consultation centers in Asia and the Americas. It also included two share holdings in France, which are accounted  for  as  joint  operations:  The  50%  interest  in Butachimie/uni00A0 SNC,  Chalamp\u00e9,  France,  to   produce  ADN  and hexamethylenediamine,  and  the  51%  interest  in  the  newly established Alsachimie S.A.S., Chalamp\u00e9, France, to produce adipic acid. With the acquisition, around 700 Solvay employees were transferred to BASF. Furthermore, some 1,000/uni00A0employees of the Alsachimie/uni00A0S.A.S. and Butachimie SNC joint operations are to be included on a pro rata basis by BASF. Goodwill of \u20ac20/uni00A0million resulted in particular from sales synergies. The majority of total goodwill was not tax deductible.\n\nThe following overview shows the effects of acquisitions in 2021 and 2020 on the Consolidated Financial Statements. When acquisitions resulted in the transfer of assets or the assumption of additional liabilities, the effects were shown as net amounts.\n\n## Effects of acquisitions\n\n|                                                                       | 2021      | 2021   | 2020      | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|\n|                                                                       | Million \u20ac | % a    | Million \u20ac | % a    |\n| Goodwill                                                              | 254       | 3.4    | 21        | 0.3    |\n| Other intangible assets                                               | 139       | 2.3    | 670       | 10.8   |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                         | 332       | 1.5    | 559       | 2.8    |\n| Financial assets                                                      | 8         | 0.1    | -         | -      |\n| Other noncurrent assets                                               | 11        | 0.3    | 108       | 2.5    |\n| Noncurrent assets                                                     | 744       | 1.4    | 1,358     | 2.7    |\n| Current assets                                                        | 692       | 2.0    | 548       | 1.8    |\n| of which cash and cash equivalents                                    | 52        | 2.0    | 68        | 1.6    |\n| Assets                                                                | 1,436     | 1.6    | 1,906     | 2.4    |\n| Equity                                                                | 348       | 0.8    | -         | -      |\n| of which noncontrolling interests                                     | 348       | 27.0   | -         | -      |\n| Noncurrent liabilities                                                | 65        | 0.3    | 264       | 0.9    |\n| of which financial indebtedness                                       | 5         | -      | -         | -      |\n| Current liabilities                                                   | 371       | 1.8    | 334       | 2.1    |\n| of which financial indebtedness                                       | 91        | 2.7    | 8         | 0.0    |\n| Total equity and liabilities                                          | 436       | 0.5    | 598       | 0.7    |\n| Payments made for acquisitions                                        | 652       |        | 1,308     |        |\n| Additions of cash and cash equivalents                                | -52       | -      | -68       | -      |\n| Payments made for acquisitions according to statement of   cash flows | 600       |        | 1,240     |        |\n\n- a Proportional share in relation to the BASF Group\n\n<!-- image -->",

The transaction also included the vegetable- oilbased sterols and natural vitamin/uni00A0 E business as well as the anionic  surfactants and esters produced at the Kankakee site. The purchase price was \u20ac177/uni00A0million. The transaction affected the Nutrition/uni00A0& Health and Care Chemicals divisions.\n- - Following the fulfillment of clearance conditions, BASF closed the divestiture of its global pigments business to DIC, Tokyo, Japan, on June 30, 2021. The business' assets and liabilities have been reported  as  a  disposal  group  since  the  business  transfer agreement was signed in August/uni00A02019. The purchase price on a cash  and  debt-free  basis  was  \u20ac1.15/uni00A0 billion.  The  transaction affected approximately 2,500/uni00A0 employees in the Dispersions/uni00A0 & Pigments  division.  The  division  was  renamed  Dispersions  & Resins following the transaction closing. The disposal group of the pigments business was derecognized when BASF's global pigments  business  was  sold  to  DIC,  Tokyo,  Japan,  on June/uni00A030,/uni00A02021.

With  over  5,200/uni00A0 employees,  Solenis  serves  customers  in water-intensive industries by helping them solve complex water treatment and process improvement challenges. BASF held a 49% share in Solenis after having transferred its wet-end paper and water chemicals business to the company in February 2019. This was accounted for using the equity method. The remaining 51% of the shares were held by funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier/uni00A0& Rice, and by Solenis management. The purchase price allocated to BASF was \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion. The investment was classified as non-integral. Its earnings and the gain on the disposal in the amount of \u20ac589 million were reported under net income from shareholdings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - On November/uni00A030, 2021, BASF completed the sale of the  precision microchemicals business to Entegris, Billerica, Massachusetts.

(KaMin)  signed  an  agreement  to  sell  BASF's  kaolin  minerals business  to  KaMin,  a  global  performance  minerals  company headquartered in Macon, Georgia. Currently, the kaolin minerals business  is  part  of  BASF's  Performance  Chemicals  division. Pending  approval  by  the  relevant  antitrust  authorities,  the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022. The kaolin minerals business has approximately 440/uni00A0 employees in North America, Europe and Asia. The divestiture comprises the production hub with sites in Daveyville, Toddville, Edgar, Gordon and  related  mines,  reserves  and  mills  in  Toomsboro  and Sandersville, Georgia. The refinery catalysts operations located at the same site are not part of the divestiture. With the agreement on the sale of the kaolin minerals business to KaMin, the affected assets and liabilities were reclassified to a disposal group, and an impairment test was performed as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021. In accordance with IFRS/uni00A0 5, the fair value less expected disposal costs was used as the recoverable amount and compared with the carrying amount. This resulted in the need for impairment in the amount of \u20ac9/uni00A0million as of December 31, 2021, which was allocated to the goodwill of the disposal group for the kaolin minerals  business.\n- - On December/uni00A06, 2021, BASF and Allianz Capital Partners, acting as party to the contract on behalf of Allianz Insurance Companies (Allianz),  agreed  to  the  purchase  by  Allianz  of  25.2%  of  the investment in the Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ) offshore wind farm. This follows a transaction between Vattenfall and BASF under which BASF acquired 49.5% of HKZ from Vattenfall on September/uni00A0 1, 2021. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to the approval of the relevant antitrust authorities. The assets and liabilities were reclassified to a  disposal group upon agreement to the investment by Allianz.\n- - On  December/uni00A0 28,  2021,  BASF  reached  an  agreement  with Clariant Corporation, Louisville, Kentucky, to sell its production site in Quincy, Florida, and the associated attapulgite business in the Dispersion/uni00A0& Resins division. The Quincy site employs around 75 employees and manufactures clay-based mineral products used in a variety of industrial applications. The purchase price amounts to $60/uni00A0million. The transaction is expected to close in the summer of 2022, subject to the approval of the relevant antitrust  authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, Agricultural Solutions offers farmers innovative and sustainable solutions, including those based on digital technologies, combined with practical advice.\n\nActivities that are not allocated to any of the divisions are recorded under Other .  These  include  other  businesses  which  comprise commodity trading, engineering and other services, as well as rental income and leases. Discontinued operations and certain activities remaining after divestitures are also reported here.\n\nThe following activities are also presented under Other:\n\n- - The steering of the BASF/uni00A0Group by corporate headquarters.\n- - Cross-divisional corporate research, which  includes  plant biotechnology research, works on long-term topics of strategic importance to the BASF/uni00A0Group. Furthermore, it focuses on the development of specific key technologies, which are of central importance for the divisions.\n- - Results from currency translation that are not allocated to the segments; earnings from the hedging of raw materials prices and foreign currency exchange risks; and gains and losses from the long-term incentive programs (LTI programs).\n- - Remanent fixed costs resulting from organizational changes or restructuring; function and region-related restructuring costs not allocated to a division; idle capacity costs from internal human resource  platforms;  and  consolidation  effects  that  cannot  be allocated to the divisions.\n\n## Income from operations (EBIT) of Other Million \u20ac\n\n|                                                                  |   2021 | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Costs for cross-divisional corporate research                    |   -355 | -364   |\n| Costs of corporate headquarters                                  |   -255 | -214   |\n| Other businesses                                                 |    180 | 169    |\n| Foreign currency results, hedging and other measurement  effects |    -62 | -59    |\n| Miscellaneous income and expenses                                |   -149 | -735   |\n| Income from operations of Other                                  |   -641 | -1,203 |\n\nIncome from operations of Other improved by \u20ac562/uni00A0million year on year, from -\u20ac1,203/uni00A0million to -\u20ac641/uni00A0million. This resulted mainly from miscellaneous  income  and  expenses, which  included special  income  from  the  partial  release  of  provisions  for  the restructuring of the Global Business Services unit. In the previous year, special charges had been recognized. The costs of corporate headquarters rose by \u20ac41/uni00A0 million year on year to \u20ac255/uni00A0 million. Income from other  businesses increased  by  \u20ac11/uni00A0 million  to \u20ac180/uni00A0 million. The costs for cross-divisional  corporate research decreased by \u20ac9/uni00A0million to \u20ac355/uni00A0million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe same accounting rules are used for segment reporting as those used for the Group, which are presented in these Notes. Transfers between  the  segments  are  generally  executed  at  adjusted market-based prices, taking into account the higher cost efficiency and lower risk of intragroup transactions. Assets, as well as their depreciation and amortization, are allocated to the segments based on economic control. Assets used by more than one segment are allocated based on the percentage of usage.\n\nIncome from operations (EBIT) before special items is used for the internal  steering  of  the  segments  and  complements  the  key management indicator, return on capital employed (ROCE). It is determined based on EBIT, which is calculated from gross profit on sales, selling expenses, general administrative expenses, research and development expenses, other operating income and expenses, and income from integral companies accounted for using the equity method. To calculate EBIT before special items, this figure is then adjusted for special items. Special items arise from the integration of acquired businesses, restructuring costs, impairments and reversals of impairments, gains or losses on divestitures and sales of integral investments accounted for using the equity method, as well as other expenses  and  income  that  arise  outside  of  ordinary  business activities.  EBIT  and  EBIT  before  special  items  are  alternative performance measures that are not defined under IFRS and are to be considered as being complementary to the indicators defined by IFRS.",

        "page_content": "## 7 Sales revenue\n\nSales revenue from contracts with customers is recognized in the amount of the consideration BASF expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services when the customer obtains control of the goods or services. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer can direct the use of the goods or services and can obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them.\n\nBASF primarily generates income from the sale of goods. Because the customer obtains control of the goods at a specific point in time, the corresponding sales revenue is recognized based on a given point in time. Determination of this point in time occurs in the context of an overall assessment of the circumstances which considers the existence of a present claim to payment, the legal title to the goods, actual physical possession of the goods, the transfer of risks and rewards as well as customer acceptance. The transfer of risks and rewards  takes  into  account  the  underlying  terms  of  delivery (especially  Incoterms)  and  is  of  particular  practical  significance. According to these principles, sales revenue from the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery. If products are delivered to a consignment  warehouse,  BASF  normally  retains  control  of  the goods.  Accordingly,  sales  revenue  is  not  recognized  until  the customer collects the goods from the consignment warehouse. Long-term  supply  agreements  usually  contain  variable  prices, dependent on the development of raw materials prices and variable volumes.\n\nServices rendered to customers by BASF are invoiced according to work completed and recognized as revenue accordingly.\n\nBASF  generates  a  portion  of  its  sales  revenue  from  license agreements. Sales revenue from license agreements is recognized based on a point in time or a period of time depending on whether the licensee is being granted a right to use (revenue recognized at a point in time) or a right to access (revenue recognized over time) the intellectual  property  of  BASF.  Sales  revenue  from  sales  and usage-based  royalties  is  recognized  in  accordance  with  the underlying settlement agreements.\n\nSales  revenue  from  the  sale  of  precious  metals  to  industrial customers  is  recognized  on  delivery  and  the  corresponding purchase prices are recorded as cost of sales. In the trading of precious metals and their derivatives with traders, where there is usually  no  physical  delivery,  revenues  are  netted  against  the corresponding  costs.\n\nIf a consideration that is contractually agreed upon by a customer includes variable components, BASF estimates the amount of the consideration. Variable components are recognized as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that previously recognized sales revenue will not have to be cancelled as soon as there is no longer uncertainty about the actual amount of the consideration. Primarily rebates and other discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue in accordance with the principle of individual measurement. BASF grants customers rebates if the goods purchased by the customer exceed a contractually defined threshold within the period  specified.  Rebates  are  usually  deducted  from  amounts payable by the customer. Taking into account the specific terms of the underlying contract, BASF uses the expected value method or the most likely amount to estimate a variable consideration amount. The method is selected based primarily on number of possible results such as the number of volume thresholds with rebates. All available information, particularly historical values, is used for  making estimates.\n\nIn some contracts, BASF grants the customer the right to return goods within a specific period of time, even if they meet the agreed specifications (sale with right of return). The actual expected amount of the consideration BASF is entitled to receive in this case is estimated using the expected value method. Refund liabilities are recognized in the amount of considerations paid by the customer for goods that are expected to be returned.\n\nBASF opts to apply the practical expedient in IFRS/uni00A0 15.63 to not adjust the amount of the agreed consideration for the effects of a material financing component if, at the beginning of a contract, no more than one year is expected to lapse between the transfer of control of the goods or services and payment by the customer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF also applies the practical expedient in IFRS/uni00A0 15.121 of not reporting information on remaining performance obligations resulting  from a contract with a maximum expected original term of one year. Furthermore, information on performance obligations is not reported if the resulting revenue is recognized in accordance with IFRS/uni00A015.B16.",

The prior-year figures have been restated accordingly.\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, expenses from restructuring and integration measures were largely attributable to global restructuring activities to improve competitiveness in various operating divisions and site closures in Europe and North America (2021: \u20ac401/uni00A0million, 2020: \u20ac435/uni00A0 million). In 2020, this item additionally contained expenses associated with the restructuring of the Global Business Services unit and site closures in Asia Pacific.\n\nExpenses from integration measures in the amount of \u20ac21/uni00A0million in 2021 related to the integration of the global polyamide business, which had been acquired from Solvay in 2020. In 2020, these expenses were \u20ac90/uni00A0 million.

Furthermore, expenses of \u20ac266/uni00A0million in 2021 and \u20ac138/uni00A0million in 2020 arose from the  addition to environmental provisions.

Further expenses resulted from changes in the fair value of currency derivatives and other hedging transactions.\n\nAs in the previous year, losses from divestitures and the disposal of noncurrent assets were mainly in connection with the divestiture of the global pigments business.\n\nThe rise in expenses from the addition of valuation allowances on business-related receivables resulted mainly from a transaction tax in Brazil.\n\nIn both years, other expenses included expenses for litigation, for REACH, for the provision of services, for warranties and for activities related to the BASF/uni00A04.0 project and for planning the new Verbund site in Guangdong, China. Other expenses arose in connection with the coronavirus pandemic in both years, but especially due to BASF's 'Helping/uni00A0Hands' aid campaign in 2020.\n\n10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method and other financial assets\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amounts of shareholdings are adjusted annually based on the pro rata share of net income, dividends and other changes in equity. Should there be indications of a reduction in the value of an investment, an impairment test is conducted and, if necessary, an impairment is recognized in the income statement. Furthermore, earnings and the carrying amount are adjusted when accounting policies deviate or as a result of purchase  price  allocations,  which  primarily  affects  Wintershall Dea/uni00A0AG, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany.\n\nExploration and development expenses in the oil and gas business, for which the equity method is applied, are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, costs of successful exploratory drilling as well as successful and dry development wells are capitalized.\n\nIncome from integral companies accounted for using the equity method  is  presented  in  EBIT,  and  income  from  non-integral companies accounted for using the equity method is presented together with income from other financial assets in net income from shareholdings.  Similarly,  integral  and  non-integral  shareholdings accounted for using the equity method are also shown separately in the balance sheet. The material equity-accounted shareholding that is classified as integral is BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China, in which BASF and Sinopec each hold 50%, and which operates the Verbund site in Nanjing, China. The material non-integral shareholding is the Wintershall/uni00A0Dea AG oil and gas company, which operated as a GmbH until July 2021, and in which BASF holds a 72.7% share of equity (voting right share 67%). Wintershall/uni00A0 Dea was operated jointly as a joint venture by partners BASF and LetterOne until October/uni00A0 2021. Through the instatement of independent members to the main body responsible for decisions about relevant activities, BASF has  exercised significant influence since November/uni00A01, 2021. Accordingly, Wintershall/uni00A0Dea has been classified as an associated company  since that date.",

Of that amount, \u20ac408/uni00A0million was attributable to Argentina, and was caused by the planned   disposal  of  operated  unconventional  oil  activities,  the increase in the corporate tax rate, an increased country risk, the implementation of a  regulated gas price scheme by the Argentine government until 2028, as well as updated price assumptions. Furthermore, the latter led to minor impairments in Norway and Libya. In the previous year, impairments amounting to \u20ac791/uni00A0million after taxes resulted from lower oil and gas price forecasts as well as from changed reserve estimates. The shareholding as a whole is recoverable.\n\nValues  in  use  were  determined  for  the  impairment  test  as  of December/uni00A0 31, 2021. The underlying assumptions for production and cost trends as well as the price assumptions for 2023 to 2040 correspond with Wintershall/uni00A0Dea's. For 2022, BASF anticipates an oil price of $75/uni00A0 per bbl of Brent crude and a gas price (TTF) of $17.2/uni00A0 per mmBtu. After a decline in oil prices to approximately $71/uni00A0per bbl in 2023, and in gas prices to around $8/uni00A0per mmBtu in 2023 and 2024, a subsequent increase is assumed at a nominal rate of 2% p.a. for both oil and gas. The expected cash flows were discounted using country-specific cost of capital rates, which reflect the relevant country risks and tax rates. The cost of capital rates in euros,  calculated  using  the  capital  asset  pricing  model,  were between 3.4% and 14.3% (2021: between 3.4% and 14.4%). A decrease of 10% in oil and gas price assumptions for the entire planning period would result in the need for an impairment of about \u20ac613/uni00A0million of the shareholding in Wintershall Dea as a whole. An increase in capital cost rates of one percentage point would lead to additional  proportional impairments of  approximately \u20ac200/uni00A0 million before tax which would burden net  income from shareholdings by \u20ac70/uni00A0million and reduce the carrying amount accordingly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on Wintershall Dea, see the chapter on Non-Integral Oil and Gas Business in the Management's Report from page 93 onward\n\nReconciliation of the carrying amounts of non-integral investments accounted for using the equity method Million \u20ac\n\n|                                                                                 | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   | Associated companies   | Associated companies   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | 2021             | 2020             | 2021                   | 2020                   |\n| Carrying amounts according to the equity method as of the beginning of the year | 10,199           | 12,401           | 675                    | 722                    |\n| Proportional income after taxes and other adjustments to income and expenses    | -                | -890             | -304                   | -35                    |\n| Proportional changes in other comprehensive income                              | -                | -1,255           | 216                    | -2                     |\n| Total comprehensive income                                                      | -                | -2,145           | -88                    | -37                    |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation                                           | -                | -                | -18                    | -                      |\n| Additions                                                                       | -                | -                | -                      | -                      |\n| Disposals                                                                       | -                | -                | -                      | -10                    |\n| Transfers                                                                       | -10,199          | -57              | 9,274                  | -                      |\n| Carrying amounts according to the equity method as of the end of the year       | -                | 10,199           | 9,843                  | 675                    |\n\nOnly the shareholding in Wintershall/uni00A0 Dea was included in joint ventures in 2020.

        "page_content": "Interest  expenses decreased  primarily  because  of  the  lower balance of financial indebtedness.\n\nWrite-downs on / losses from securities and loans declined mainly due to lower impairments on loans to nonconsolidated Group companies.\n\nThe net interest expense from underfunded pension plans and similar obligations declined year on year as a result of the lower interest  rate  used  to  determine  expenses  for  pension  benefits compared with the previous year.\n\nThe rise in other financial expenses was primarily due to higher net expenses associated with the translation of bonds and the valuation of  the  corresponding  hedging  instruments  against  interest  and currency  risks.\n\n## 12 Income taxes\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn Germany, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15.0% as well as a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon are levied on all distributed and retained earnings. In addition to corporate income tax, income generated in Germany is subject to a trade tax. It varies depending on  the  municipality  in  which  the  company  is  represented.  The weighted average tax rate was 14.6% in 2021 (2020: 14.5%). The 30%  rate  used  to  calculate  deferred  taxes  for  German  Group companies remained unchanged in 2021. The income of foreign Group companies is assessed using the tax rates applicable in their respective countries.\n\nDeferred taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements according to IFRS and the carrying amounts for tax purposes as well as for tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. These also comprise temporary differences arising from business combinations, with the exception of goodwill. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the respective country-specific tax rates applicable for the period in which the asset or liability is realized or settled. Tax rate changes enacted or substantively enacted on or before the balance sheet date are taken into consideration.\n\nDeferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities provided they are related to the same taxation authority. Surpluses of deferred tax assets are only recognized provided that the tax benefits are likely to be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on the probability of a reversal of the differences and the assessment of the ability to utilize tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. This depends on whether future taxable profits will exist during the period in which temporary differences are reversed and in which tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits can be claimed. The assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on internal projections of the future earnings of the particular Group company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChanges in deferred taxes in the balance sheet are recorded as deferred tax expense or income unless the underlying transaction is recognized directly in equity or in income and expenses recognized in equity. For those effects which have been recognized in equity, changes to deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are also recognized directly in equity.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for differences between the proportional IFRS equity and the tax base of the investment in a consolidated subsidiary if a reversal of these differences is expected in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for dividend  distributions  planned  for  the  following  year  if  these distributions lead to a reversal of temporary differences.\n\nProvisions for German trade tax, corporate income tax and similar income taxes are calculated and recognized based on the expected taxable income of the consolidated companies less any prepayments that have been made. Provisions are set up for interest accrued. This interest is reported under other financial result, not tax expense. Other taxes to be assessed are considered accordingly.\n\nIFRIC/uni00A023 clarifies the application of the recognition and  measurement policies from IAS/uni00A0 12 when there is uncertainty regarding income tax-related treatment of individual transactions. They are accounted for  with  the  assumption  that  tax  authorities  will  examine  the questionable  transaction  and  have  all  relevant  information.  The amount  of  risk  provisions  is  calculated  and  reviewed  with consideration for the results of past tax audits as well as the legal assessment of not yet audited transactions and the risk of a  deviating tax-related interpretation by the tax authorities. The most  probable value of the individual risks is recognized.\n\n## Tax expense and tax rate\n\nThe BASF/uni00A0Group tax rate amounted to 19.2% in 2021 (2020: 5.8%). The relatively high tax rate in relation to 2020 resulted primarily from lower  nondeductible  operating  expenses,  caused  largely  in  the previous year by non-tax-effective impairments of goodwill, and from the increased earnings contributions of countries with higher",

Of these, \u20ac3/uni00A0million will expire in 2022, \u20ac4/uni00A0million in 2023, \u20ac2/uni00A0million in 2024, \u20ac12/uni00A0million in 2025, \u20ac52/uni00A0million in 2026, and \u20ac20/uni00A0million in 2027 and thereafter. The remaining \u20ac79/uni00A0million will not expire.\n\nSurpluses of deferred tax assets for companies that reported tax losses  in  2021  or  2020  totaled  \u20ac2,379/uni00A0 million  as  of  December/uni00A0 31,/uni00A0 2021 (December/uni00A031, 2020: \u20ac2,645/uni00A0million). Deferred taxes were recognized because, due to planned earnings, the use of temporary differences or loss carryforwards is expected.\n\n## Tax liabilities\n\nTax liabilities primarily include assessed income taxes and other taxes as well as estimated income taxes not yet assessed for the current year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The weighted average amortization periods of intangible assets were as follows:\n\nAcquired intangible assets (excluding goodwill) with defined useful  lives  are  generally  measured  at  cost  less  straight-line amortization. The useful life is determined using the period of the underlying contract or the period of time over which the intangible asset can be expected to be used.\n\nImpairments are recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of either the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The value in use is determined on the basis of future cash inflows and outflows, and the weighted average cost of capital after taxes, depending on tax rates and country-related risks. If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had an impairment not been recognized. Depending on the type of intangible asset, amortization is reported under cost of sales, selling expenses, research and development expenses or other operating expenses.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are trade names and trademarks that have been acquired as part of acquisitions. These are measured at cost and tested for impairment annually, or if there is an indication that their value has declined.\n\nInternally generated  intangible  assets primarily comprise internally developed software. Such software and other internally generated intangible assets are measured at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairments are recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount. In addition to those costs directly attributable to the asset, costs of internally generated intangible assets also include an appropriate portion of overhead costs.\n\n## Weighted average amortization in years\n\n|                                               |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Distribution and similar rights               |     15 |     14 |\n| Product rights, licenses and trademarks       |     25 |     30 |\n| Know-how, patents and production technologies |     16 |     16 |\n| Internally generated intangible assets        |      5 |      4 |\n| Other rights and values                       |      8 |      5 |\n\nEmission rights: Emission certificates, which are granted free of charge  by  the  German  Emissions  Trading  Authority  (Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle) or a similar authority in other countries, are recognized in the balance sheet with a value of zero. Emission rights purchased on the market are capitalized at cost as intangible assets. Emissions generated create an obligation to surrender the emission certificates.  Intangible  assets  purchased  on  the  market  are subsequently measured at fair value, up to a maximum of the amount of the acquisition costs. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount on the balance sheet date, the emission rights are impaired.\n\nGoodwill is  only  written  down  in  the  case  of  an  impairment. Impairment  testing  for  goodwill  is  performed  once  a  year  and whenever there is an indication of impairment. Goodwill impairments are not reversed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF's goodwill is allocated to 20 cash-generating units (2020: 20), which are defined either on the basis of business units or at a higher level.\n\nThe respective recoverable amounts were determined using the value in use. Plans approved by company management and their respective cash flows for the next five years were used. For the period thereafter, a terminal value was calculated using a forward projection from the last detailed planning year as a perpetual  annuity. Planning  is  based  on  experience,  current  performance  and management's best possible estimates on the future development of  individual parameters, such as raw materials prices and profit margins. Market assumptions regarding, for example, economic development, inflation expectations and market growth are included based on external macroeconomic and industry-specific sources.\n\nThe fundamental transformation of the automotive industry will have a  significant  impact  on  the  emissions  catalyst  business,  which belongs  to  the  Catalysts  (excluding  battery  materials)  cashgenerating unit. In the planning period, the demand for catalysts is initially expected to remain stable as a result of higher environmental standards. In the medium term, the transition from combustion engines to electromobility will lead to a steady decline in demand. For this reason, the growth rate for perpetual annuity was adjusted from 2.0% in 2020 to -0.7% in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the Surface Technologies segment, which the cash-generating Catalysts (excluding battery materials) unit is allocated to, see the Management's Report from page 82 onward\n\nThe required discounting of cash flows for impairment testing is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital rate after tax, which is determined using the capital asset pricing model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the weighted cost of capital rate, see Note 1 from page 200 onward",

The calculation also takes into account capital structure and the beta factor of the respective peer group as well as the average tax rate of each cash-generating unit. Impairment tests were performed on the units assuming a weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes of between 5.51% and 6.67% (2020: between 4.86% and 6.92%). This corresponds to a weighted average cost of capital rate before taxes of between 6.53% and 8.94% (2020: between 6.50% and 8.85%).\n\nAfter determining the recoverable amounts for the cash-generating units, the conclusion was that reasonable possible deviations from the key assumptions would not lead to the carrying amount of any unit except the Surface Treatments unit exceeding the respective recoverable amounts.\n\nIn 2020, a goodwill impairment for the cash-generating Surface Treatment unit was recognized in the amount of \u20ac786/uni00A0 million in other expenses due to the significant drop in demand from effects of the coronavirus pandemic and expectations for slow recovery. The outcome  of  the  annual  impairment  test  in  2021  was  that  the recoverable  amount  for  the  cash-generating  unit  exceeded  the carrying amount by \u20ac408/uni00A0million. The recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount if the weighted average cost of capital rate  rose  by  1.05  percentage  points  or  the  growth  rate  were 1.46/uni00A0percentage points lower.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The revaluation method is not applied. Low-value assets are fully expensed in the year of acquisition.\n\nThe cost of self-constructed plants includes direct costs,  appropriate allocations of material and production overhead costs, and a share of the general administrative costs of the divisions involved in the construction of the plants.\n\nExpenses  related  to  the  scheduled  maintenance  of  large-scale plants  are  capitalized  separately  and  depreciated  using  the straight-line  method  over  the  period  until  the  next  planned turnaround.  Costs  for  the  replacement  of  components  are recognized as assets if an additional future benefit is expected. The carrying  amount  of  the  replaced  components  is  derecognized. Costs  for  maintenance  and  repair  as  part  of  normal  business operations are recognized as an expense.\n\nAs lessee, BASF generally recognizes all leases in the balance sheet. The right-of-use assets from leases and lease liabilities are  measured at the present value of the financial commitments entered.\n\nFor more information, see Note/uni00A016 from page 244 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestment properties held to realize capital gains or rental income are immaterial. They are valued at the lower of fair value or cost less depreciation.\n\nBoth movable and immovable fixed assets are principally  depreciated using  the  straight-line  method.  The  estimated  useful  lives  and depreciation methods of property, plant and equipment are based on historical values, plans and estimates. The depreciation  methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.\n\nThe weighted average depreciation periods of continuing operations were as follows:\n\n## Weighted average depreciation in years\n\n|                                        |   2021 |   2020 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Buildings and structural installations |     18 |     16 |\n| Machinery and technical equipment      |     11 |     10 |\n| Miscellaneous equipment and fixtures   |      7 |      6 |\n\nIf there is indication of a possible cause for impairment, an  impairment test is performed. Impairments to property, plant and equipment are recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The measurement is based on fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. An impairment is recognized for the difference  between  the  carrying  amount  and  the  recoverable amount.  If  the  reasons  for  an  impairment  no  longer  exist,  the write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had an impairment  not  been  recognized.  Impairments  and  reversals  of impairments are reported in other operating income and expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the value in use and the weighted cost of capital rate, see Note/uni00A01 from page/uni00A0200 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBorrowing costs: If borrowing costs are directly incurred as part of the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, they are capitalized as part of the acquisition or production cost of that asset. A qualifying asset is an asset for which the process necessary to make it ready for its intended use or sale is longer than one year. Borrowing costs are capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use. Borrowing costs were calculated based on a rate of 1.25% (previous year: 1.5%) and adjusted on a country-specific basis, if necessary. All other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nGovernment grants: Government grants related to the acquisition or  construction  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  reduce  the acquisition or construction cost of the respective assets. Other government  grants  or  government  assistance  are  recognized immediately  as  other  operating  income  or  treated  as  deferred income and released over the underlying period.",

        "page_content": "Additions to property, plant and equipment arising from investment projects (excluding leases) amounted to \u20ac3,465/uni00A0 million in 2021. Investments  were  made  at  the  following  sites  in  particular: Ludwigshafen,  Germany;  Antwerp,  Belgium;  Zhanjiang,  China; Geismar,  Louisiana;  and  Freeport,  Texas.  Material  investments included engineering services and the procurement of technical equipment in connection with development of the new Verbund site in  Zhanjiang,  China,  as  well  as  construction  and  expansion  of ethylene oxide and polyethylene oxide production plants in Antwerp, Belgium, and Ludwigshafen, Germany. Investments also included modernization  measures,  particularly  at  the  Ludwigshafen  site. Government grants for funding investment measures reduced asset additions by \u20ac5/uni00A0 million. The additions to advance payments for right-of-use assets related only to the acquisition of land use rights at the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China.\n\nAdditions from acquisitions resulted from the acquisition of the 51% share in BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd.\n\nFor more information on acquisitions, see Note/uni00A03 from page 207 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, impairments of \u20ac155/uni00A0million and reversals of impairments of  \u20ac13/uni00A0 million  were  included  in accumulated  depreciation. Impairments  of  \u20ac49  million  related  to  machinery  and  technical equipment as well as buildings at a production site in Asia in the Industrial Solutions segment. The value in use of \u20ac2/uni00A0 million was calculated applying a pre-tax cost of capital rate of 6.89%.  This corresponds to a cost of capital rate of 9.05%. Furthermore, there was a complete write-down in the amount of \u20ac17/uni00A0million due a plant closure  at  a  production  site  in  North  America  in  the  Materials segment, which related almost entirely to machinery and technical equipment. Impairments to construction in progress mainly related to discontinued investment projects. Reversals of impairments in the amount of \u20ac13/uni00A0million resulted primarily from an increase in the fair value of plants impaired at a site in North America in 2020.\n\nDisposals of property, plant and equipment mainly included the sale of the production site in Kankakee, Illinois, and the disposal of BASF's share in the condensate splitter in Port Arthur, Texas.\n\nTransfers related mainly to the reclassification of operation-ready assets from construction in progress to other asset categories.\n\nTransfers to disposal groups related largely to reclassified amounts in connection with the divested kaolin minerals business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on divestitures, see Note/uni00A03 from page 207 onward\n\nCurrency  effects raised  property,  plant  and  equipment  by \u20ac798/uni00A0million/uni00A0and resulted mainly from appreciation of the U.S./uni00A0dollar and the Chinese renminbi against the euro.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If separation is required under IFRS, the embedded lease is recorded separately from its host contract and each component of the contract is accounted  and  measured  in  accordance  with  the  applicable regulations.\n\nAs lessee, BASF accounts for nearly all leases, recognizing right-ofuse assets for leased assets and liabilities for lease agreements. The following principles are considered:\n\n- - BASF  exercises  the  exemption  for  lease  agreements  with  a maximum term of 12/uni00A0 months from the date of provision and low-value  assets.  Low-value  assets  are  generally  defined  as leased assets worth a maximum of \u20ac5,000.\n- - Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, taking into account the incremental borrowing rate.\n- - As a general rule, BASF separates non-lease components, such as services, from lease payments.\n- - A right-of-use asset is generally recognized at the same amount as the lease liability. Differences may arise from the lease  payments made prior to the provision of the leased asset, less any lease incentives  received.\n- - After capitalization at commencement date, whereby the right-ofuse asset is measured at cost, the right-of-use asset is generally depreciated over the lease term using the straight-line method.\n- - A number of leases, particularly for real estate and barges, include extension and termination options. Extension and termination options are taken into account on recognition of the lease liability only if BASF is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised in the future. When contract terms are being determined, consideration is given to all facts and circumstances that offer an economic incentive for exercising extension options or not exercising termination options. Changes in lease terms arising from the exercise of an extension option or non-exercise of a termination option are only considered if sufficient certainty exists. Estimates and  expectations  which  are  asserted  at  the commencement date of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset and pertain to future payments not yet determined on the date of provision are assessed continuously during the lease term. If subsequently improved or changed knowledge influences the  expected  payment  profile  over  time,  the  lease  liability  is remeasured.\n- - If an existing lease contract is modified, the lease liability and right-of-use asset must be remeasured, provided the modification changes the payment profile (pursuant to the interest and  principal\n\n## BASF as lessee\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n## December/uni00A031, 2021\n\n## December/uni00A031, 2020\n\n|                     | Lease liabilities   |   Interest portion | Future lease  payments   | Lease liabilities   |   Interest portion | Future lease  payments   |\n|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|\n| 2022                | 336                 |                 30 | 366                      | 334                 |                 29 | 363                      |\n| 2023                | 219                 |                 27 | 246                      | 233                 |                 28 | 261                      |\n| 2024                | 153                 |                 29 | 182                      | 156                 |                 23 | 179                      |\n| 2025                | 100                 |                 25 | 125                      | 109                 |                 24 | 133                      |\n| 2026                | 74                  |                 20 | 94                       | 74                  |                 18 | 92                       |\n| 2027 and thereafter | 532                 |                167 | 699                      | 455                 |                151 | 606                      |\n| Total               | 1,414               |                298 | 1,712                    | 1,361               |                273 | 1,634                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nplan) or the scope (either quantitatively or time-related) of use of the asset.\n\nBASF presents the interest component of lease payments in cash flows from operating activities and the repayment portion in cash flows from financing activities.

If the market price or the fair value of the sales products, which are based on the net  realizable values, is lower, then the sales products are written down to this lower value. The net realizable value is the estimated price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated selling costs.\n\nIn addition to direct costs, cost of conversion includes an  appropriate allocation of production overhead costs based on normal utilization rates of the production plants, provided that they are related to the production process. Pensions, social services and voluntary social benefits are also included, as well as allocations for administrative costs, provided they relate to the production. Borrowing costs are not included in cost of conversion.\n\nInventories may be impaired if the prices for the sales products decline, or in cases of a high rate of days sales of inventory (DSI). Write-downs on inventories are reversed if the reasons for them no longer apply.\n\nThe  exception  made  by  IAS/uni00A0 2  for  traders  is  applied  to  the measurement  of  precious  metals.  Accordingly,  inventories  held exclusively for trading purposes are measured at fair value less costs to sell and recognized in the precious metal trading item (carrying amount  as  of  December/uni00A0 31,  2021:  \u20ac1,554/uni00A0 million; as  of December/uni00A0 31, 2020: \u20ac1,604/uni00A0 million) under miscellaneous current assets. All changes in value are immediately recognized in the statement of income.\n\n## Inventories\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                  | Dec./uni00A031,  2021   | Dec./uni00A031,  2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Raw materials and factory supplies               | 4,414                   | 3,105                   |\n| Work in progress, finished goods and merchandise | 9,337                   | 6,784                   |\n| Advance payments and services in progress        | 117                     | 121                     |\n| Inventories                                      | 13,868                  | 10,010                  |\n\nWork in progress, finished goods and merchandise are  combined into one item due to production conditions in the chemical industry. Services in progress mainly relate to services not invoiced as of the balance sheet date.\n\nCost  of  sales  included  inventories  recognized  as  an  expense amounting to \u20ac44,244/uni00A0million in 2021, and \u20ac30,379/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\nWrite-downs  on  inventory  were  recognized  in  the  amount  of \u20ac97/uni00A0million in 2021, and in the amount of \u20ac65/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Current loan receivables increased because of the sale of assets to a joint venture partner in North America.\n\nThe rise in noncurrent derivatives with positive fair values primarily affected the market valuation of combined interest rate and currency swaps. The change in current derivatives with positive fair market values was largely attributable to the increase in fair values of commodity derivatives for precious metals.\n\nBank acceptance drafts are used as an alternative form of  payment in China. Bank acceptance drafts are issued at a discount from their par  value.  They  can  be  held  to  maturity,  traded  or  redeemed prematurely at a discount. If BASF discounts a bank acceptance draft  with  recourse,  a  liability  toward  the  credit  institution  is recognized in the amount of the payment received. The increase relates to higher sales and broader use of this form of payment.\n\nPrepaid  expenses in  2021  mainly  included  prepayments  of \u20ac41/uni00A0million related to operating activities compared with \u20ac28/uni00A0million in 2020, as well as \u20ac93/uni00A0million in prepayments for insurance in 2021 compared with \u20ac79/uni00A0million in 2020. Prepayments for license costs decreased from \u20ac70/uni00A0million in 2020 to \u20ac49/uni00A0million in 2021. Prepaid expenses in 2021 included higher advance payments for received precious metal catalysts to be refurbished.\n\nAs in the previous year, defined benefit assets were recognized in 2021 mainly at Group companies in Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe change in current tax refund claims was largely attributable to the rise in value-added tax receivables in Germany as well as the rise in  income  tax/other  tax  receivables  at  South  American  Group companies.",

Under a global excess of loss policy, future  bad  debts  are  insured  for  essentially  all  BASF/uni00A0 Group companies excluding joint ventures. The program has no impact on the calculation of valuation allowances in accordance with IFRS/uni00A09. No compensation claims were incurred in either 2021 or 2020.\n\nPayment terms are generally agreed upon individually with customers and, as a rule, are within 90/uni00A0days. In 2021, valuation  allowances of \u20ac120/uni00A0million (2020: \u20ac142/uni00A0million) were added for trade accounts receivable,  and  valuation  allowances  of  \u20ac110/uni00A0 million  (2020: \u20ac124/uni00A0million) were reversed.\n\nIn 2021, valuation allowances of \u20ac28/uni00A0 million were recognized for other receivables representing financial instruments, and valuation allowances  of  \u20ac40/uni00A0 million  were  reversed.  In  the  previous  year, valuation allowances of \u20ac98/uni00A0million were recognized and valuation allowances of \u20ac13/uni00A0million were reversed.\n\nAdditions  included  valuation  allowances  of  \u20ac1/uni00A0 million  due  to  a change  in  valuation  parameters.  Additions  primarily  included valuation  allowances  of  loans  to  former  and  current  Group companies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are no preferential voting rights or other restrictions. BASF/uni00A0SE does not hold any treasury shares.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  resolution  of  the  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting on May/uni00A0 3, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase, until May/uni00A02, 2024, on a one-off basis or in portions on a number of occasions, the company's share capital by a total of up to \u20ac470/uni00A0million by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in kind. In principle, shareholders are entitled to a subscription right. However, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' statutory subscription rights in the cases specified in the authorizing resolution. The Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to lay down the further contents of the share rights and the details of the execution of the capital increase. The total shares issued on the basis of the above authorization with the exclusion of the shareholders' subscription right in the case of capital increases in return for contributions in cash or in kind must not exceed 10% of the share capital at the time that this authorization comes into effect or - if this value is lower - at the time of its exercise. The proportionate amount of the share capital of those shares that are to be issued on the basis of conversion or option bonds  granted  during  the  term  of  this  authorization  under  the exclusion of the subscription right, must be credited against the aforementioned ceiling of 10%. This authorization has not been exercised to date.\n\n## Conditional capital\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A0 12, 2017, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue, on a one-off basis or in portions on more than one occasion, bearer or registered\n\nconvertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants, or combinations of these  instruments,  with  or  without  maturity  limitations  up  to  a nominal value of \u20ac10/uni00A0billion until May/uni00A011, 2022. The notional interest in the share capital attributable to the BASF shares to be issued in connection with the debt instruments issued under this  authorization may not exceed 10% of the share capital.\n\nIn this connection, the share capital was increased conditionally by up to \u20ac117,565,184 by issuing a maximum of 91,847,800/uni00A0 new registered BASF shares. The conditional capital increase will only be carried out to the extent to which holders of convertible bonds, or warrants attached to bonds with warrants issued, exercise their conversion  or  option  rights.  This  authorization  had  not  been exercised as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year.\n\n## Authorization of share buybacks\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A012, 2017, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to buy back shares until May/uni00A011, 2022, in accordance with  section/uni00A071(1) no./uni00A0 8 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The buyback may not exceed 10% of the company's share capital at the time the resolution was passed and can take place via the stock exchange, a public purchase offer addressed to all shareholders, or a public invitation to the shareholders to submit sales offers. This authorization has not been exercised.\n\nOn January/uni00A04, 2022, the Board of Executive Directors approved a share buyback program with a maximum volume of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion to be implemented between January/uni00A0 2022 and December/uni00A0 2023. The share  buyback  program  is  based  on  the  previously  described authorization  from  May/uni00A0 12,  2017.  A  proposal  to  renew  the authorization to buy back own shares is planned for the 2022/uni00A0 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which would authorize the continuation of the share buyback program already underway.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Subscribed capital\n\nSubscribed  capital  remained  unchanged  year  on  year  at \u20ac1,176/uni00A0million and comprises 918,478,694/uni00A0qualifying shares.\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nCapital  reserves  include  effects  from  BASF's  share  program, premiums from capital increases and consideration for warrants and negative  goodwill  from  the  capital  consolidation  resulting  from acquisitions of subsidiaries in exchange for the issue of BASF/uni00A0SE shares at par value.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nThe acquisition of shares in companies that BASF already controls or that are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a joint arrangement is treated as a transaction between shareholders, as long as this does not lead to a change in the consolidation method. There were no material transactions of this type in 2021, as in the previous year.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                         | December/uni00A031,  2021   | December/uni00A031,  2020   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Legal reserves          | 958                         | 901                         |\n| Other retained earnings | 39,407                      | 37,010                      |\n| Retained earnings       | 40,365                      | 37,911                      |\n\nLegal reserves rose by \u20ac57/uni00A0 million in 2021 and by \u20ac70/uni00A0million in 2020 due to reclassifications from retained earnings.\n\nOther retained earnings include, among other things, earnings generated in the past by companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Moreover, deferred taxes in the amount of -\u20ac18/uni00A0 million arising from an adjustment in connection with the introduction of IAS/uni00A019 were offset against retained earnings in equity.\n\n## Payment of dividends\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  resolution  of  the  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2021, BASF/uni00A0SE paid a dividend of \u20ac3.30/uni00A0per qualifying share from the retained profit of the 2020/uni00A0fiscal year. With 918,478,694/uni00A0 qualifying shares, this represented total dividends of \u20ac3,030,979,690.20. The remaining \u20ac914,882,378.80 in retained profits was allocated to retained earnings.\n\n## 20 Other comprehensive income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe expenses and income shown in other comprehensive income are divided into two categories: Items that will be recognized in the income statement in the future (known as 'recycling') and items that will not be reclassified to the income statement in the future. The first category includes gains and losses from currency translation, the measurement of certain securities classified as debt instruments, and changes in the fair value of derivatives held to hedge future cash flows. Items that will not be reclassified to the income statement at a future date include effects from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans.\n\n## Remeasurement of defined benefit plans\n\nChanges in the value of defined benefit plans led to an increase in other comprehensive income of \u20ac2,709/uni00A0 million in 2021 and to a decrease of \u20ac973/uni00A0million in the previous year (after taxes in both years).  Of  that,  \u20ac44/uni00A0 million  was  attributable  to  investments accounted for using the equity method in 2021 (2020: -\u20ac19/uni00A0million). Deferred taxes amounted to -\u20ac811/uni00A0million in 2021 and to \u20ac422/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\nBecause of the disposal of the pigments business on June/uni00A030,/uni00A02021, the amount of \u20ac48/uni00A0million for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans, plus an additional \u20ac6/uni00A0million resulting from the disposal of the operational companies of Solenis UK International/uni00A0 Ltd., London, United Kingdom, which had been accounted for using the equity method  until  that  date,  was  reclassified,  in  equity,  from  other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Moreover, deferred taxes in the amount of -\u20ac18/uni00A0million arising from an adjustment in connection with the introduction of IAS/uni00A0 19 were offset against retained earnings in equity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the remeasurement of defined benefit plans, see Note/uni00A022 from page/uni00A0254\n\nonward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Currency translation\n\nDifferences resulting from currency translation increased equity by a total of \u20ac2,205/uni00A0million and decreased equity by \u20ac2,598/uni00A0million in the previous  year.  This  included  deferred  taxes  in  the  amount  of -\u20ac19/uni00A0 million  in  2021  (2020:  \u20ac19/uni00A0 million).  At-equity  investments accounted for \u20ac697/uni00A0million (2020: -\u20ac1,125/uni00A0million). The differences resulted primarily from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Chinese renminbi relative to the euro in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of divestitures and other changes in the scope of consolidation, \u20ac52/uni00A0million after taxes was reclassified to the income statement in 2021 and \u20ac71/uni00A0million after taxes in 2020.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  designated  in  hedging relationships (cash flow hedges) adjusted for deferred taxes in the amount of -\u20ac10/uni00A0million (2020: \u20ac24/uni00A0million) reduced equity by a total of \u20ac329/uni00A0 million (2020: \u20ac108/uni00A0million). In 2021, -\u20ac381/uni00A0million (2020: -\u20ac163/uni00A0million) was attributable to the hedging of future cash flows at shareholdings accounted for using the equity method.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on cash flow hedge accounting, see Note/uni00A026.5 from page/uni00A0274 onward",

Benefits generally depend on years of service, contributions or compensation, and take into consideration the legal framework of labor, tax and social security laws of the countries where the companies are located. To limit the risks of changing financial market conditions as well as demographic developments, employees have, for a number of years now, been almost  exclusively offered defined contribution plans for future years of service.\n\nThe Group Pension Committee monitors the risks of all pension plans  of  the  Group  with  regard  to  the  financing  of  pension commitments and the portfolio structure of existing plan assets. The organization, responsibilities, strategy, implementation and  reporting requirements are documented for the units involved.\n\nThe accounting policies presented in the following relate to defined benefit pension obligations.\n\nProvisions  for  pensions  are  calculated  on  an  actuarial  basis  in accordance with the projected unit credit method. Assumptions relating to the following valuation parameters, among others are used: future developments in compensation, pensions and inflation, employee  turnover,  and  the  life  expectancy  of  beneficiaries. Obligations are discounted based on the market yields on highquality corporate fixed-rate bonds.\n\nSimilar obligations, especially those arising from commitments by North American Group companies to pay the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired staff and their dependents, are reported under provisions for similar obligations.",

    {
        "page_content": "Actuarial  reports  are  used  to  calculate  the  amount  of  pension provisions.\n\nActuarial gains and losses from changes in estimates relating to the actuarial assumptions used to calculate defined benefit obligations, the difference between standardized and actual returns on plan assets, as well as the effects of the asset ceiling are recognized directly in equity as other comprehensive income.\n\n## Economic and legal environment of the plans\n\nIn some countries - especially in Germany, in the United States, in the  United  Kingdom  and  in  Switzerland  -  there  are  pension obligations  subject  to  government  supervision  or  similar  legal restrictions. For example, there are minimum funding requirements to  cover  pension  obligations,  which  are  based  on  actuarial assumptions that differ from those pursuant to IAS/uni00A019. Furthermore, there are qualitative and quantitative restrictions on allocating plan assets  to  certain  asset  categories.  This  could  result  in  annual fluctuations in employer contributions, financing measures and the assumption of obligations in favor of the pension funds to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe obligations and the plan assets used to fund the obligations are exposed to demographic, legal and economic risks. Economic risks are primarily due to unforeseen developments on commodity and capital  markets.  They  affect,  for  example,  pension  adjustments based on the level of inflation in Germany and in the United  Kingdom, as well as the impact of discount rates on the amount of the defined benefit obligation. In previous years, measures taken to close plans with defined benefits for future service, especially benefits based on final pay promises and the assumption of healthcare costs for  former employees, led to a reduction in risk with regard to future benefit levels.\n\nThe strategy of the BASF Group with regard to financing pension commitments takes into account country-specific supervisory and tax regulations.\n\nIn some countries, pension benefits were granted for which the employer has a subsidiary liability. Pension benefits in a number of countries include minimum interest guarantees to a limited extent. If the pension fund cannot generate the income needed to provide the minimum guarantee, this must be provided by the employer under the subsidiary liability. To the extent that recourse to the employer is unlikely based on the structure and execution of the pension  benefits as well as the asset situation of the pension fund, these plans are treated as defined contribution plans.\n\n## Description of the defined benefit plans\n\nThe following section describes the typical plan structure in the individual countries. Different arrangements may exist, in particular due to the assumption of plans as part of acquisitions; however, these do not have any material impact on the description of plans in the individual countries.\n\n## Germany\n\nFor BASF/uni00A0 SE and German Group companies, a basic level of benefits  is  provided  by  BASF  Pensionskasse/uni00A0 VVaG,  a  legally independent plan, which is financed by employer and employee contributions as well as the return on plan assets. BASF/uni00A0SE ensures the  necessary  contributions  to  adequately  finance  the  benefits promised by BASF/uni00A0 Pensionskasse VVaG. Some of the benefits financed via BASF Pensionskasse/uni00A0VVaG are subject to adjustments that must be borne by its member companies to the extent that these cannot be borne by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG due to the regulations imposed by the German supervisory authority. In 2004, the basic benefit plan was closed for newly hired employees at German BASF companies and replaced by a defined contribution plan.  A  new  defined  contribution  plan  was  introduced  as  of July/uni00A0 1,/uni00A0 2021, for new hires in the German BASF companies. At BASF/uni00A0 SE, occupational pension promises that exceed the basic level of benefits are financed under a contractual trust arrangement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nby BASF Pensionstreuhand/uni00A0 e.V.; at German Group companies, these benefits are financed primarily via pension provisions. The benefits are largely based on cash balance plans. Furthermore, employees are given the option of participating in various deferred compensation schemes.\n\n## United States\n\nEmployees  are  granted  benefits  based  on  defined  contribution plans.\n\nEffective 2010, the existing defined benefit plans were closed to further increases in benefits based on future years of service, and benefits earned in the past were frozen. There is no entitlement to pension adjustments to compensate for cost-of-living increases.\n\nThe legal and regulatory frameworks governing the plans are based on the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which requires the plan sponsor to ensure a minimum funding level. Any employer contributions necessary to meet the minimum funding level are based on the results of an actuarial valuation. Furthermore, there are unfunded pension plans that are not subject to ERISA requirements.\n\nAdditional  similar  obligations  arise  from  plans  that  assume  the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired employees and their dependents. Such plans have been closed to new entrants since 2007. In addition, the amount of the benefits for such plans has been frozen.",

        "page_content": "## Switzerland\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe employees of the BASF/uni00A0Group in Switzerland receive a  company pension, which is financed through a pension fund by employer and employee contributions as well as the return on plan assets. The pension plans are accounted for as defined benefit plans, as the obligatory minimum pension guaranteed by law under the Swiss Pension Fund Act (BVG) is included in the scheme. All benefits vest immediately. According to government regulations, the employer is obligated to make contributions, so that the pension funds are able to grant the minimum benefits guaranteed by law. The pension funds are managed by boards, where employer and employees are equally represented, which steer and monitor the benefit plans and asset allocation.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nEmployees are granted benefits based on a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe BASF Group also maintains defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, which have been closed for further increases based on future years of service. Adjustments to compensate for increases in the cost of living until the beginning of retirement are legally required for beneficiaries of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe financing of the pension plans is determined by the provisions of the regulatory authority for pensions and the relevant social and labor law requirements. The defined benefit plans are administered by a trust company, whose Board of Trustees, according to the trustee  agreement  and  law,  represents  the  interests  of  the beneficiaries and ensures that the benefits can be paid in the future. The  required  funding  is  determined  using  technical  valuations according to local regulations every three years.\n\n## Other countries\n\nFor  Group  companies  in  other  countries,  defined  benefits  are covered in some cases by pension provisions, but mainly by external insurance companies or pension funds.\n\nThe valuation of the defined benefit obligation is based on the following key assumptions:\n\n## Assumptions used to determine the defined benefit obligation as of December/uni00A031\n\n|                             |   Germany |   Germany | United States   | United States   | Switzerland   | Switzerland   |   United  Kingdom |   United  Kingdom |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                             |    2021   |    2020   | 2021            | 2020            | 2021          | 2020          |            2021   |            2020   |\n| Discount rate               |       1.1 |       0.7 | 2.70            | 2.30            | 0.40          | 0.10          |               2   |               1.5 |\n| Projected pension  increase |       1.6 |       1.5 | -               | -               | -             | -             |               3.5 |               3.1 |\n\n## Assumptions used to determine expenses for pension benefits in the respective business year\n\n|                             |   Germany |   Germany | United States   | United States   | Switzerland   | Switzerland   |   United  Kingdom |   United  Kingdom |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                             |    2021   |    2020   | 2021            | 2020            | 2021          | 2020          |            2021   |            2020   |\n| Discount rate               |       0.7 |       1.1 | 2.30            | 3.10            | 0.10          | 0.20          |               1.5 |               2.2 |\n| Projected pension  increase |       1.5 |       1.5 | -               | -               | -             | -             |               3.1 |               3   |\n\nThe assumptions used to ascertain the defined benefit obligation as of December/uni00A0 31 are used in the following year to determine the expenses for pension plans.\n\nA Group-wide, uniform procedure is used to determine the discount rates applied for valuation of material pension obligations of the BASF/uni00A0Group.

In order to mitigate risks and maximize returns, a widely spread global portfolio of individual assets is held.\n\nLiability-driven investment (LDI) techniques, such as hedging the risk of changes in interest rates and inflation, are used in some pension plans, especially for U.K. and U.S. plans.\n\n## Structure of plan assets\n\n%\n\n|                                 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equities                        |     26 |     28 |\n| Debt instruments                |     45 |     47 |\n| of which for government debtors |     18 |     19 |\n| for other debtors               |     27 |     28 |\n| Real estate                     |      6 |      5 |\n| Alternative investments         |     21 |     17 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents       |      2 |      3 |\n| Total                           |    100 |    100 |\n\nThe asset class debt instruments comprises promissory notes and debentures  (Pfandbriefe)  as  well  as  corporate  and  government bonds. Government bonds primarily relate to bonds from countries with very high credit ratings, such as the United States, the United Kingdom,  Germany  and  Switzerland.  Government  bonds  from emerging countries are also held to a limited extent. Corporate bonds mainly comprise bonds from creditworthy debtors, although particular high-yield bonds are also held to a limited extent. In connection with the continuous monitoring of default risk based on a given risk budget and on the observation of the development of\n\nthe creditworthiness of issuers, the plan asset allocation may be adjusted in the case of a revised market assessment. Alternative investments largely comprise investments in private and infrastructure  equity,  absolute  return  funds  and  senior  secured loans.\n\nAlmost all of the equities are priced on active markets. The  category debt  instruments includes  promissory  notes  and  debentures (Pfandbriefe) acquired through private placements with a market value in the amount of \u20ac188/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021, and \u20ac110/uni00A0 million  as  of  December/uni00A0 31,  2020.  For  such  securities, especially those held by domestic pension plans, there is no active market. There is also no fungible market price for the additional amount of \u20ac387/uni00A0 million, especially in the category of alternative investments and real estate . The capital market compensates for this lack of fungibility with yield premiums depending on the  maturity.\n\nPlan assets as of the balance sheet date contained securities issued by BASF Group companies with a market value of \u20ac0/uni00A0million in 2021 and \u20ac1/uni00A0million in 2020. The market value of the properties of legally independent  pension  funds  rented  to  BASF  Group  companies remained unchanged from the previous year at \u20ac112/uni00A0million.\n\nSince 2010, an agreement has existed between BASF/uni00A0 SE and BASF/uni00A0 Pensionskasse VVaG on the granting of profit participation capital with a nominal value of \u20ac80/uni00A0million to strengthen the financing of the BASF Pensionskasse VVaG. The existing profit participation capital was paid back to BASF SE in 2021. To enable Pensionskasse/uni00A0 VVaG to meet future regulatory solvency requirements and strengthen its risk-bearing capacity, BASF/uni00A0SE temporarily  provided the pension fund with capital in the form of a retrospective initial fund loan with a nominal value of \u20ac220/uni00A0million in 2021. The pension fund utilized \u20ac80/uni00A0million of that amount in 2021. Furthermore, BASF/uni00A0Pensionstreuhand e.V. reimbursed BASF/uni00A0SE in 2021 with \u20ac250/uni00A0million in pension payments relating to 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe funding of the plans was as follows:\n\n## Current funding situation of the pension plans as of December/uni00A031\n\n## Million \u20ac\n\n|                        | 2021                         | 2021            | 2020                         | 2020            |\n|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                        | Defined  benefit  obligation | Pension  assets | Defined  benefit  obligation | Pension  assets |\n| Unfunded pension plans | 2,121                        | -               | 1,840                        | -               |\n| Funded pension plans   | 26,508                       | 23,130          | 28,000                       | 21,400          |\n| Total                  | 28,629                       | 23,130          | 29,840                       | 21,400          |\n\n## Defined contribution plans and government pensions\n\nThe  contributions  to  defined  contribution  plans  recognized  in income from operations amounted to \u20ac308 million in 2021 and \u20ac306/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\nContributions to government pension plans were \u20ac578/uni00A0 million in 2021 and \u20ac557/uni00A0million in 2020.",

Provisions are recognized at the probable settlement value.\n\nProvisions for environmental protection and remediation costs are recognized for expected costs for rehabilitating contaminated sites, recultivating landfills, removal of environmental contamination at existing production or storage sites and similar measures.\n\nIn  addition,  other  provisions  also  cover  expected  costs  for restoration obligations for dismantling  existing  plants  and buildings. If BASF is the only responsible party that can be identified, the provision covers the entire expected obligation. At sites  operated together with one or more partners, the provision generally covers only BASF's share of the expected obligation. The amount of the provision is determined based on the available technical information on the site, the technology used, legal regulations, and official requirements.  The  calculation  accounts  for  expected  significant changes in obligations.\n\nProvisions for restructuring measures include severance payments to departing employees or similar personnel expenses as well as expected costs for site closures, including the costs for demolition and similar measures. Provisions are recognized for these expenses when the relevant measures have been planned and announced by management.\n\nProvisions for employee obligations primarily consist of variable compensation including associated social security contributions, as well as obligations for granting long-service bonuses. The latter are predominantly calculated based on actuarial principles.\n\nProvisions for obligations from sales and purchase contracts largely comprise obligations arising from rebates granted and other price discounts in the Agricultural Solutions segment, warranties and product liabilities, sales commissions and expected losses on contracts.\n\nProvisions for litigation, damage claims, warranties and similar obligations contain anticipated expenses from lawsuits in which BASF is the defendant party, as well as obligations under damage claims against BASF and fines. In order to determine the amount of the  provisions,  the  company  takes  into  consideration  the  facts related to each case, the size of the claim, compensation awarded in  similar  cases  and  independent  expert  advice  as  well  as assumptions  regarding the probability of a successful claim and the range  of  possible  claims.  Actual  costs  can  deviate  from  these estimates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe probable amount required to settle noncurrent provisions is discounted if the effect of discounting is material. In this case, the provision is recognized at present value. Assumptions must be made in determining the discount rate (2021: 1.25%; 2020: 1.5%) used for calculating noncurrent provisions. Financing costs related to unwinding the discount of provisions in subsequent periods are shown in other financial result.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                 | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                                 |                            | Of which  current          |                            | Of which  current          |\n| Restoration obligations                                         | 158                        | 21                         | 148                        | 21                         |\n| Environmental protection and  remediation costs                 | 926                        | 94                         | 693                        | 114                        |\n| Employee obligations                                            | 2,368                      | 1,907                      | 1,174                      | 754                        |\n| Obligations from sales and  purchase  contracts                 | 1,423                      | 1,379                      | 1,134                      | 1,114                      |\n| Restructuring measures                                          | 279                        | 229                        | 414                        | 371                        |\n| Litigation, damage claims,  warranties and similar  obligations | 79                         | 26                         | 205                        | 161                        |\n| Other                                                           | 486                        | 279                        | 541                        | 290                        |\n| Total                                                           | 5,717                      | 3,935                      | 4,309                      | 2,825                      |",

        "page_content": "## 24 Risks from litigation and claims\n\nBASF Corporation has potential liability under the Comprehensive Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws for investigation and cleanup at certain sites. The Lower Passaic River Study Area (LPRSA) is one such site comprising the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River in New Jersey. BASF Corporation and more than 60 other companies (collectively, the Lower Passaic River Study Area Cooperating Parties Group or CPG) agreed to complete a remedial investigation / feasibility study (RI/FS) of the LPRSA. In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) selected a final remedy for the lower eight miles of the LPRSA. A decision from USEPA on a targeted approach  for  the  upper  portion  of  the  LPRSA  was  issued  on September 30, 2021. BASF Corporation established a provision covering BASF's currently estimated share of the remediation costs.\n\nSince August 2019, BASF Corporation has been served in various U.S.  federal  and  state  lawsuits  alleging  property  and  resource damages and personal injuries from possible exposure to per- and polyflouroalkyl  substances  (PFAS).  In  December  2018,  a  multidistrict litigation (MDL) was created to coordinate claims brought against manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) in particular, which plaintiffs allege contains toxic levels of certain PFAS compounds including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Plaintiffs  typically allege that exposure to AFFF has caused loss of use and enjoyment of  property,  diminished  property  value,  remediation  costs,  and personal injuries including various types of cancers. The complaints name BASF as a defendant in connection with its 2009 acquisition of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc. and the legacy Ciba/BASF Lodyne fluorochemical  product  lines.  BASF  has  been  named  in  over 1,200/uni00A0suits as of January 2022 and is defending all litigation.\n\nAt this time, BASF cannot predict the outcomes of resolving these matters  or  what  potential  actions  may  be  taken  by  regulatory agencies. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to BASF's financial results.\n\nFurthermore, BASF SE and its affiliated companies are defendants in or parties to a variety of legal or regulatory proceedings on a recurring basis. To our current knowledge, none of these proceedings will have a material effect on the economic situation of BASF.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  guarantees  do  not  stipulate  a  maximum amount. The risk of a claim being exercised against the guarantees is classified as low. In addition, guarantees by BASF SE existed until January/uni00A0 12, 2022, for restoration obligations of Wintershall Dea Norge/uni00A0AS for various oil and gas facilities acquired from Equinor.\n\nThe rise in obligations from initiated investment projects is mainly attributable to large-scale projects which began in 2021.\n\n## Obligations arising from purchase contracts\n\nObligations  from  purchase  contracts   resulted  primarily  from long-term purchase obligations for raw  materials as well as supply agreements for renewable energy. The increase is mainly due to long-term energy supply agreements concluded in 2021, including about \u20ac3.5 billion for green energy from the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm.\n\n- For more information on long-term energy supply agreements, see the chapter on Energy and climate protection in the Management's Report from page 126 onward\n\nFirm  purchase  obligations  as  of  December  31,  2021,  were  as follows:\n\n## Obligations arising from purchase contracts\n\n## Million \u20ac\n\n|                                                  | Dec./uni00A031,  2021   | Dec./uni00A031,  2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Following year 1                                 | 9,686                   | 8,003                   |\n| Following year 2                                 | 4,963                   | 5,347                   |\n| Following year 3                                 | 1,832                   | 3,419                   |\n| Following year 4                                 | 1,716                   | 1,317                   |\n| Following year 5                                 | 1,720                   | 1,238                   |\n| Following year 6 and maturities beyond this year | 11,823                  | 4,165                   |\n| Total                                            | 31,741                  | 23,489                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 26 Supplementary information on financial instruments\n\n## 26.1 Accounting policies\n\nFinancial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  recognized  in  the consolidated balance sheet when the BASF Group becomes a party to a financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognized when BASF no longer has a contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset or when the financial asset is transferred together with all material risks and rewards of ownership and BASF does not have control of the financial asset after it has been transferred. For example, receivables are derecognized when they are definitively found  to  be  uncollectible  such  as  in  the  event  of  concluded insolvency proceedings. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligations expire, are discharged or cancelled. Regular-way  purchases  and  sales  of  financial  instruments  are accounted for using the settlement date; in precious metal trading, the trade date is used.\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If pricing on an active market is available, for example in the form of exchange prices, these are used as the basis for the measurement. Otherwise, the measurement is based on either internal measurement models using current market parameters or external measurements, for example, from banks. These internal measurements rely predominantly on the net present value method and option pricing models. These models incorporate, for example, expected future cash  flows  as  well  as  discount  factors  adjusted  for  term  and, potentially, risk. Depending on the availability of market parameters, BASF assigns financial instruments' market values one of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy pursuant to IFRS/uni00A013. Reassignment to a different level during a fiscal year is only carried out if the availability of observable market parameters for identical or similar items   changes.",

        "page_content": "The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow condition (the 'solely payments of principle and interest' criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model used for managing financial asset  portfolios.  Based  on  these  two  criteria,  BASF  uses  the following measurement categories for financial assets:\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include all financial assets whose cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition established in IFRS/uni00A0 9. At BASF, derivatives, for example, are allocated to this measurement category. In general, BASF does not exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of financial instruments not to be measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances.\n- -Financial assets measured at amortized cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9, to the extent that the asset is held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows over its term. At BASF, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivable, as well as  receivables reported under other receivables and miscellaneous assets and certain securities.\n\nInitial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value, which usually corresponds to the transaction price at the time of acquisition or, in the case of trade accounts receivable, to the transaction price pursuant to IFRS 15. Subsequent measurement effects  are  recognized  in  income  using  the  effective  interest method.\n\nImpairments are recognized for expected credit losses in both initial and subsequent measurement, even before the occurrence of any default event. Counterparties are generally considered to default  when  they  become  insolvent,  become  a  debtor  in  a creditor  protection  program  or  are  in  a  finance-related  legal dispute  with  BASF,  or  more  than  half  of  BASF's  receivables portfolio with them is more than 90/uni00A0days overdue. In these cases, individual impairments are recognized for the financial assets measured at amortized cost that are then considered to be credit impaired.\n\nThe extent of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit risk of a financial asset, as well as any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, expected credit losses are generally  recognized over the lifetime of the asset. If, however, the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period, impairments  are  generally  only  recognized  as  12-month  expected credit  losses.  By  contrast,  under  the  simplified  approach  for determining  expected  credit  losses  permitted  by  IFRS/uni00A0 9, impairments for receivables such as lease receivables and trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable  concerned.\n\nAt BASF, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal  information  and  external  rating  information  on  the respective counterparty.  A significant increase in the  counterparty's credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. It is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have increased significantly.\n\nRegional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and expectations are taken into account when assessing the extent of impairment as part of the calculation of expected credit losses and individual impairments. In addition, BASF uses internal and  external  ratings  and  the  assessments  of  debt  collection agencies and credit insurers, when  available. Individual impairments are also based on experience relating to customer solvency  and  customer-specific  risks.  Factors  such  as  credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at amortized  cost,  are  likewise  considered  when  calculating\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nimpairments. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to an immaterial extent. Expected  credit losses and  individual impairments are only calculated for those receivables that are not covered  by  insurance  or  other  collateral.  Impairments  on receivables  whose  insurance  includes  a  deductible  are  not recognized in excess of the amount of the deductible.\n\nA decrease in impairment due, for example, to a reduction in the credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event occurring after the  impairment  is  recorded  in  profit  or  loss.  Reversals  of impairments may not exceed amortized cost, less any expected future credit losses.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9. Furthermore, the assets in this measurement category may not just be held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows over their term, but also generating cash flows from their sale. At BASF, certain securities that are reported as other financial assets or  marketable securities are allocated to this category. BASF does not exercise the option to subsequently measure equity instruments through other comprehensive income.\n\nAssets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value,  which  usually corresponds to the transaction price of the securities allocated to this category at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of income when the asset is disposed of.\n\nImpairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized in profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "The  following  measurement  categories  are  used  for  financial liabilities:\n\n- -Financial  liabilities  measured  at  amortized  cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent measurement is recognized in profit or loss at amortized cost using the effective interest method. At BASF, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial indebtedness are measured at amortized cost.\n- -Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss contain derivative financial liabilities. These are likewise measured at the value of the consideration received as the fair value of the liability on the date of initial recognition. Fair value is also applied as a measurement basis for these liabilities in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently measure non- derivative financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised.\n\nDerivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial instrument. If IFRS policies require separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its host contract and measured at fair value. If IFRS/uni00A0 9 does not provide for separation, the hybrid instrument is accounted for at fair value in its entirety.\n\nFinancial guarantees of the BASF Group are contracts that require compensation payments to be made to the guarantee holder if a debtor fails to make payment when due under the terms of a transaction entered into with the holder of the guarantee. Financial guarantees issued by BASF are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. In subsequent periods, these financial guarantees are carried at the higher of amortized cost or the best estimate of the present obligation as of the reporting date.\n\nIn cash flow hedges, future cash flows and the related income and expenses are hedged against the risk of changes in fair value. To this end, future underlying transactions and the corresponding hedging instruments  are  designated  in  a  cash  flow  hedge  accounting relationship for accounting purposes. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument, which often meets the definition of a derivative, and the cost of hedging are recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income over the term of the hedge, taking deferred taxes into account. The ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. In the case of future transactions that lead to recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a nonfinancial liability, the cumulative fair value changes of the hedge in equity are generally charged against the cost of the hedged item on its initial recognition. For hedges based on financial assets, financial liabilities or future transactions, cumulative fair value changes of the hedges are transferred from equity to the income statement in the reporting period in which the hedged item is recognized in the income statement. The maturity of the hedging instrument is aligned with the effective date of the future transaction.\n\nWhen fair value hedge accounting is used, the asset or liability recognized is hedged against the risk of a change in fair value. The hedging instruments used, which often take the form of a derivative, are measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of income. The carrying amounts of the assets or liabilities designated as the underlying transaction are also  measured at fair value through the statement of income.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This only refers to transactions in U.S. dollars.\n\n## Market risks\n\nForeign currency risks: Changes in exchange rates could lead to losses in the value of financial instruments and adverse changes in future cash flows from planned transactions. Foreign currency risks from financial instruments result from the translation at the closing rate of financial receivables, loans, securities, cash and financial liabilities  into  the  functional  currency  of  the  respective  Group company. Foreign currency contracts in various currencies are used to  hedge  foreign  exchange  risks  from  nonderivative  financial instruments and planned transactions.\n\nThe foreign currency risk exposure corresponds to the net amount of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial instruments that are exposed to currency risks. In addition, planned purchase and sales transactions of the respective following year are included if they fall under the currency risk management system. Long and short positions in the same currency are offset against each other.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating a 5% and 10% appreciation of the respective functional currency against the other currencies. A 5% appreciation of the respective functional currency would  have  reduced  BASF's  income  before  income  taxes  by \u20ac174/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031,/uni00A02021. A 10% appreciation of the respective functional currency would have resulted in a negative effect on BASF's income before income taxes in the amount of \u20ac326/uni00A0million. A 5% appreciation of the respective functional  currency resulted in an effect on BASF's income in the amount of  -\u20ac203/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031,/uni00A02020 (-\u20ac390/uni00A0million with a 10% appreciation).

Interest rate swaps and combined interest rate and currency derivatives are used in individual cases to hedge these risks. The derivatives are presented in Note 26.5. Interest rate risks are relevant to BASF's financing activities but are not of material significance for BASF's operating activities.\n\nThe variable interest risk exposure, which also includes fixed rate bonds maturing in the following year, amounted to -\u20ac2,408/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (2020: -\u20ac1,659 million). An increase in all relevant interest rates by one half of a percentage point would have lowered  income  before  income  taxes  by  \u20ac4/uni00A0 million  as  of December/uni00A031, 2021.

Accordingly, the interest rates affected by the reform will be phased out and replaced by new ones. The publication of all GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBORs as well as USD LIBORs with maturities of one week and two months was discontinued as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021. Publication of the remaining USD LIBORs is expected to continue until June/uni00A030, 2023.\n\nBASF is continuously monitoring developments arising from the IBOR reform to ensure the timely adjustment of existing contracts as well as to identify potential financial risks at an early stage. Particular consideration is given to the carrying amounts or nominal values (derivatives) of contracts that reference an interest rate affected by the reform and therefore may still have to be converted to an alternative  interest  rate  (contracts  yet  to  be  adjusted).

        "page_content": "December/uni00A031, 2021, financial liabilities related to contracts yet to be adjusted were identified in the amount of \u20ac302/uni00A0million. These are mainly  variable-rate  bank  loans  referenced  to  a  USD  LIBOR (\u20ac187/uni00A0million) or EONIA (\u20ac115/uni00A0million).  Furthermore, financial assets related to contracts yet to be adjusted were identified in the amount of \u20ac85/uni00A0 million. These are mainly short-term loans, particularly to nonconsolidated subsidiaries, that are referenced to a USD LIBOR (\u20ac85 million). No derivatives were identified that are associated with contracts yet to be adjusted.\n\nCommodity price risks: Some of BASF's divisions are exposed to strong fluctuations in raw materials prices. These result primarily from raw materials (for example naphtha, benzene, natural gas, LPG condensate)  as  well  as  from  precious  metals.  BASF  takes  the following  measures  to  reduce  price  risks  associated  with  the purchase of raw materials:\n\n- - BASF uses commodity derivatives to hedge risks from the volatility of raw materials prices. These are primarily options on crude oil, oil products and natural gas.\n- - The Catalysts division enters into both short-term and long-term purchase  contracts  with  precious  metal  and  battery  metal producers. It also buys precious metals on spot markets from various business partners. The price risk from metals purchased to be sold on to third parties, or for use in the production of catalysts  and  battery  materials,  is  hedged  using  derivative instruments. This is mainly performed using forward contracts, which are settled by either entering into offsetting contracts or by delivering the precious metal.\n- - In the Agricultural Solutions division, the sales prices of products are  sometimes  pegged  to  the  price  of  certain  agricultural commodities.  To  hedge  the  resulting  risks,  derivatives  on agricultural commodities are concluded.\n\nIn addition, BASF holds limited unhedged precious metal and oil product positions, which can also include derivatives, for trading on its own account. The value of these positions is exposed to market price volatility and is subject to constant monitoring.\n\nBy  holding  commodity  derivatives  and  precious  metal  trading positions,  BASF  is  exposed  to  price  risks.  The  valuation  of commodity derivatives and precious metal trading positions at fair value means that adverse changes in market prices could  negatively affect the earnings and equity of BASF.\n\nBASF  concluded  several  physical  power  purchase  agreements (physical PPAs) in Europe with terms of up to 25/uni00A0 years in 2021. Under the physical PPAs, BASF procures electricity and associated green electricity certificates, known as guarantees of  origin (GoOs), at a fixed price. Some physical PPAs are not eligible for the own use exemption and are therefore recognized as derivatives in the balance sheet. In addition, BASF concluded what is known as a virtual power purchase agreement (virtual PPA) with a term of 15/uni00A0years in the United States in 2021. The virtual PPA contains an embedded contract for difference for electricity that is recognized separately as a derivative in the balance sheet.\n\nBASF performs value-at-risk analyses for all commodity derivatives and precious metal trading positions. Using the value-at-risk  analysis enables continual quantification of market risk and forecasting of the maximum possible loss within a given confidence interval over a defined period. The value-at-risk calculation is based on a  confidence interval of 95% and a holding period of one day. BASF uses the variance-covariance approach.\n\nBASF uses value at risk in conjunction with other risk management tools. Besides value at risk, BASF sets volume-based limits as well as exposure and stop-loss limits.\n\n## Exposure due to commodity derivatives\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                   | Exposure                   | Value at risk              | Exposure                   | Value at risk              |\n| Crude oil, oil  products  and  natural  gas       | 97                         | 18                         | 56                         | 5                          |\n| Precious metals                                   | 51                         | 1                          | 88                         | 1                          |\n| Agricultural  commodities                         | 58                         | 0                          | 37                         | 0                          |\n| Electricity and   green electricity  certificates | 388                        | 7                          | -                          | -                          |\n\nThe exposure corresponds to the net amount of all long and short positions of the respective commodity category.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on BASF's financial risks and risk management, see Opportunities and Risks from page/uni00A0151 onward\n\n## Default and credit risk\n\nDefault and credit risks arise when customers and debtors do not fulfill  their  contractual  obligations.  BASF  regularly  analyzes  the creditworthiness of the counterparties and grants credit limits on the basis of this analysis. Due to the global activities and diversified customer  structure  of  the  BASF  Group,  there  is  no  significant concentration of default risk. The carrying amount of all receivables, loans  and  interest-bearing  securities  plus  the  nominal  value  of financial obligations stemming from contingent liabilities not to be recognized represents the maximum default risk for BASF.\n\nFor more information on credit risks, see Note/uni00A018 from page 247 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nBASF promptly recognizes any risks from cash flow fluctuations as part of liquidity planning. BASF has ready access to sufficient liquid funds from the ongoing commercial paper program and confirmed lines of credit from banks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The difference between carrying amounts and fair values results primarily from changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe financial instruments reported under Derivatives - no hedge accounting,  of  which  fair  value  level  3,  in  the  table 'Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments' relate to a contract for difference for electricity embedded in a virtual power purchase  agreement  (virtual  PPA).  The  expected  contractual capacity  of  the  solar  power  plant  in  Texas,  United  States,  is 50/uni00A0 mega watts. The solar park is scheduled to go into operation in 2023. The level 3 fair value is determined as the present value of the expected  cash  flows  from  the  contract  for  difference.  The  key valuation  parameters  are  the  expected  electricity  prices  and expected   production  volumes.  A  change  in  the  key  valuation parameters as of December/uni00A031, 2021 would have  affected the fair value of the contract for difference as follows:\n\n## Sensitivities virtual PPA contract for difference for electricity (United States)\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n| Change in expected    electricity prices   | Change in expected    electricity prices   | Change in expected     production volumes   | Change in expected     production volumes   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| +10%                                       | -10%                                       | +10%                                        | -10%                                        |\n| 5                                          | -5                                         | 1                                           | -1                                          |\n\nAt the time of initial recognition, the fair value of the contract for difference, which was calculted using a valuation model, was higher than the transaction price. As this is a level 3 fair value, the difference of \u20ac12/uni00A0million is deferred and reported in the balance sheet together with the positive or negative fair value of the contract for difference, according  to  the  valuation  model,  under  other  receivables  and miscellaneous assets or other liabilities. The difference is reversed using the straight-line method over the term of the contract. Income from the reversal of the difference will be recognized in profit or loss under other  operating income. The changes in fair value according to the  valuation model are recognized in profit or loss as other operating income or other operating expenses.\n\nThe  financial  instruments  reported  under  Derivatives  -  hedge accounting,  of  which  fair  value  level  3,  in  the  table 'Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments' relate to two physical power purchase agreements (physical PPAs) concluded in Europe. The physical PPAs are based on wind turbines in the Netherlands with an expected proportional capacity of 35/uni00A0 megawatts each. The wind farm is scheduled to go into operation in 2022 or 2023. Unlike virtual PPAs, physical PPAs provide for actual supply of  electricity  volumes  to  BASF.  In  addition  to  electricity,  BASF receives   certificates verifying the 'green properties' of the electricity, known as  guarantees of origin (GoOs). BASF purchases both the electricity and the GoOs at a fixed price under the physical PPAs. Because the physical PPAs described here are not eligible for the own use  exemption, they are to be recognized in the balance sheet as  derivatives and measured at fair value. Level 3 fair value is determined as the present value of the difference between the agreed fixed price and the expected market prices for electricity or GoOs. The key valuation parameters are the expected electricity and GoO prices as well as the expected  production volumes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sensitivities physical PPAs (Europe) Million \u20ac\n\n| Change in  expected  electricity  prices   | Change in  expected  electricity  prices   | Change in  expected   GoO prices   | Change in  expected   GoO prices   | Change in  expected  production   volumes   | Change in  expected  production   volumes   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| +10%                                       | -10%                                       | +10%                               | -10%                               | +10%                                        | -10%                                        |\n| 42                                         | -42                                        | 1                                  | -1                                 | 8                                           | -8                                          |\n\nAt the time of initial recognition, the physical PPAs' fair values, which were calculated using a valuation model, were higher or lower, respectively, than the transaction prices. As these are level 3 fair values, the differences amounting to \u20ac14/uni00A0 million and -\u20ac5 mil lion were deferred and recognized in the balance sheet together with the positive fair values of the contracts, according to the valuation model,  under  assets  of  disposal  groups.  The  differences  are reversed over the term of the contract using the straight-line  method. The resulting gains and losses are reported in profit or loss under other operating income or other operating expenses.\n\nThe physical PPAs were designated in a cash flow hedge  accounting relationship. Accordingly, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instruments is recognized directly in equity (other comprehensive income). Possible ineffectiveness is recognized in profit or loss as other operating income or other operating expenses.",

All insignificant shareholdings are measured at cost (carrying amount: \u20ac514/uni00A0million). Fair value level 1 is applied to publicly listed shareholdings. Level 2 is  applied to shareholdings for which valuation is based on parameters observable in the market to the greatest extent possible. These may be adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective shareholding in the fair value.\n- b AC: amortized cost; FVTOCI: fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss; a more detailed description of the categories can be found in Note 26.1 from page 263 onward.\n- c Fair value was determined based on quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.\n- d Fair value was determined based on parameters for which directly or indirectly quoted prices on active markets were available.\n- e Fair value was determined based on parameters for which there was no observable market data.\n- f Does not include separately shown derivatives or receivables and liabilities from finance leases. If miscellaneous receivables are valued at fair value through profit or loss, their valuation is generally based on parameters observable on the market. These are adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective assets in the fair value.\n- g The carrying amount of the physical PPAs reported in the balance sheet under assets of disposal groups is \u20ac71/uni00A0million after subtracting the differences of \u20ac14/uni00A0million and -\u20ac5/uni00A0million described on page 269.\n- h The carrying amount of the contract for difference for electricity reported in the balance sheet under other liabilities is \u20ac1/uni00A0million after subtracting the difference of \u20ac12/uni00A0million described on page 269.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All insignificant shareholdings are measured at cost (carrying amount: \u20ac439/uni00A0million). Fair value level 1 is applied to publicly listed shareholdings. Level 2 is  applied to shareholdings for which valuation is based on parameters observable in the market to the greatest extent possible. These may be adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective shareholding in the fair value.\n- b AC: amortized cost; FVTOCI: fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss; a more detailed description of the categories can be found in Note 26.1 from page 263 onward.\n- c Fair value was determined based on quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.\n- d Fair value was determined based on parameters for which directly or indirectly quoted prices on active markets were available.\n- e Fair value was determined based on parameters for which there was no observable market data.\n- f Does not include separately shown derivatives or receivables and liabilities from finance leases. If miscellaneous receivables are valued at fair value through profit or loss, their valuation is generally based on parameters observable on the market. These are adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective assets in the fair value.\n\n<!-- image -->",

liabilities' shows the extent to which assets and liabilities were offset in the balance sheet, as well as potential effects from the offsetting of derivatives subject to a legally enforceable global netting agreement (primarily in the form of an ISDA agreement) or similar agreement. For positive fair values of combined interest rate and currency swaps, the respective counterparties provided cash collaterals in an amount comparable to the outstanding fair values.\n\nDeviations  from  the  derivatives  with  positive  fair  values  and derivatives with negative fair values reported in other receivables and  other  liabilities  at  the  end  of  2021  and  2020  arose  from derivatives not subject to any netting agreements as well as from embedded derivatives. These are not included in the table above.\n\nIn addition to the offsetting of derivatives presented in the table above, trade accounts receivable in 2021 were offset against trade accounts payable and advance payments received on orders, which were included in current other liabilities, provided specific netting agreements with customers existed. As a result, trade accounts\n\nreceivable were reduced by \u20ac805 million. The reduction in trade accounts payable was \u20ac36/uni00A0 million and the reduction in advance payments received on orders was \u20ac769/uni00A0million. Accordingly, the net amount for trade accounts receivable was \u20ac11,942 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac12,747/uni00A0million). The resulting net amount for trade accounts payable was \u20ac7,826 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac7,862/uni00A0 million). The net amount for advance payments received on orders was \u20ac949 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac1,718/uni00A0million). In 2020, trade accounts receivable were also offset against trade accounts payable and the advance payments received on orders included in current other liabilities. This reduced trade accounts receivable by \u20ac616 million. The reduction in trade accounts payable was \u20ac45/uni00A0 million and the reduction in advance payments received on orders was \u20ac571/uni00A0million. Accordingly, the net amount for trade accounts receivable was \u20ac9,466 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac10,082/uni00A0 million). The resulting net amount for trade accounts payable was \u20ac5,291 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac5,336/uni00A0 million). The net amount for advance payments received on orders was \u20ac679 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac1,250/uni00A0million).",

        "page_content": "## 26.5 Derivative financial instruments and hedging relationships\n\n## The use of derivative financial instruments\n\nBASF is exposed to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks during the normal course of business. These risks are hedged using derivative instruments as necessary in accordance with  a  centrally  determined  strategy.  Hedging  is  employed  for existing underlying transactions from the product business, cash investments and financing as well as for planned sales, raw material purchases and capital measures. Furthermore, hedging may also be used for cash flows from acquisitions and divestitures. The risks from the hedged items and the derivatives are continually monitored. Where derivatives have a positive market value, BASF is exposed to credit risks from derivative transactions in the event of nonperformance of the other party. To minimize the default risk on derivatives with  positive market values, transactions are exclusively conducted with creditworthy banks and partners and are subject to predefined credit  limits.\n\n## Fair value of derivative instruments\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                                 | December/uni00A031, 2021   |   December/uni00A031, 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Foreign currency forward contracts                                              | 21                         |                         10 |\n| Foreign currency options                                                        | 1                          |                         35 |\n| Foreign currency derivatives                                                    | 22                         |                         45 |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) | 0                          |                         35 |\n| Combined interest rate and currency swaps                                       | 102                        |                       -163 |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) | 179                        |                         90 |\n| Interest derivatives                                                            | 102                        |                       -163 |\n| Commodity derivatives                                                           | 324                        |                       -321 |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) | 107 a                      |                          7 |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                | 447                        |                       -439 |\n\n- a Of which \u20ac71 million reported in the balance sheet under assets of disposal groups\n\nTo ensure efficient risk management, risk positions are centralized at BASF  SE  and  certain  Group  companies.  The  contracting  and execution of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes are conducted according to internal guidelines, and subject to strict control mechanisms.\n\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated using  valuation  models  that,  if  available,  use  input  parameters observable on the market. Exceptions to this are some commodity derivatives, whose valuation is based directly on market prices.\n\nIn addition to the derivative instruments presented in the following table, BASF also had derivatives that were embedded in other financial instruments. This primarily related to options embedded in a loan on the borrower's equity instruments. The fair value of these derivatives was \u20ac33/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031,/uni00A02020. The options were exercised in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nBASF is exposed to commodity price risks in the context of  procuring naphtha. Some of the planned purchases of naphtha are hedged using  swaps  and  options  on  oil  and  oil  products.  The  main contractual  elements  of  these  items  are  aligned  with  the characteristics of the hedged item. Cash flow hedge accounting was employed for a portion of these hedging relationships in 2021 and 2020. The average exercise price of the designated options was $675.54 per metric ton as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021 (December/uni00A031, 2020: $454.45 per metric ton). Cash flows from designated hedging instruments and hedged transactions occur in the following year and are also recognized in profit or loss for that year.\n\nFurthermore, cash flow hedge accounting continued to be  employed to a minor extent for procuring natural gas, which is likewise  exposed to commodity price risks. Commodity price-based options serve as hedging instruments, for which contract terms are defined to reflect the risks of the hedged item. Depending on where trading took place, the average exercise price of the designated options was \u20ac32.60 per MWh or $3.74 per mmBtu as of December/uni00A031, 2021. The average exercise price of the designated options was \u20ac13.35 per MWh or $2.74 per mmBtu as of December/uni00A0 31, 2020. Cash flows from the hedging transaction and hedged item are generally recognized in profit or loss for the following year.\n\nThe change in the options' time value is recognized separately in equity as costs of transaction-related hedging and, in the year during which the hedged items mature, it is initially derecognized against the carrying amount of the procured assets and recognized in profit or loss when the assets are consumed. In 2021, a decrease in fair value of \u20ac27 million was recognized in equity, and \u20ac24 million was  initially  derecognized  against  the  carrying  amount  of  the inventories procured and then recognized upon consumption in profit or loss. In 2020, a decrease in fair value of \u20ac17 million was recognized as a reduction in equity, and \u20ac13 million was derecognized against the carrying amount of the assets.",

        "page_content": "BASF's planned soybean procurement is also exposed to commodity price risks. These commodity price risks are hedged with  soybean futures. The contractual conditions for these hedging transactions correspond to the respective hedged item, and some are designated in cash flow hedge accounting relationships. The average price hedged using these instruments was $13.35 per bushel as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (December/uni00A031, 2020: $12.52 per bushel). Cash flows from these futures and the hedged expected future transactions are generally recognized in profit or loss for the following year.\n\nThe physical power purchase agreements that were reported as derivatives  in  the  balance  sheet  were  designated  as  hedging instruments to a cash flow hedge accounting relationship. The average price hedged using these instruments was \u20ac45.44 per MWh of electricity and \u20ac1.83/uni00A0per GoO as of December/uni00A031, 2021. The realized hedging results are recognized in profit or loss upon occurrence of the hedged underlying transactions in the years 2022 to 2048.\n\nDue to planned sales in U.S. dollars, BASF is exposed to foreign currency risks, which are partially hedged with currency options and designated  in  a  cash  flow  hedge  accounting  relationship.  The hedged transaction - the designated share of expected sales in U.S./uni00A0dollars - is calculated based on internal thresholds. The  hedged volume is always below the total amount of expected sales in U.S./uni00A0 dollars for the following fiscal year. The average hedged rate was $1.1630 per euro as of December/uni00A031,/uni00A02021, and $1.1583 per euro in the previous year. The impact on earnings from designated transactions in 2021 will be recognized in the following year. The decrease in the options' time value component arising in the amount of \u20ac14 million in 2021 was recognized separately in equity as the cost of hedging and resulted in a reduction in equity. Due to the maturity of hedged items, accumulated changes in the options' time values were reclassified as a reduction in earnings in the amount of \u20ac19/uni00A0million. In 2020, \u20ac30/uni00A0million was recognized as a change in the options'  time  value  component,  thereby  reducing  equity;  and \u20ac34/uni00A0million was reclassified as a reduction in earnings.\n\nFurthermore,  BASF  SE's  fixed-rate  U.S.  private  placement  of $1.25/uni00A0 billion,  issued  in  2013,  was  converted  to  euros  using cross-currency swaps, as the private placement exposes BASF to a combined  interest/currency  risk.  The  hedged  interest  rate  was 4.13% in the fiscal years 2021 and 2020. The hedged foreign exchange rate in both years was $1.3589 per euro. This hedge was designated as a cash flow hedge.\n\nFurthermore, BASF was exposed to foreign currency risks in 2021 through U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper. These risks are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts and designated in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship.  The changes in the value of the hedging instruments in the amount of \u20ac11/uni00A0 million resulting from the change in the forward rate were recognized as time-  periodrelated  hedging  costs.  Because  all  underlying  transactions  and hedging  instruments  had  expired  by  December/uni00A0 31,  2021,  the amount of \u20ac11/uni00A0million, which was initially recognized in equity, was reclassified  in  full  as  an  increase  in  earnings.  There  was  no ineffectiveness at any time during the year.\n\nThe  expected  sales  price  associated  with  the  disposal  of  the pigments business was partially hedged against exchange rate fluctuations in 2021 and 2020. The occurrence of the hedged transactions was, due to contractual agreements, considered highly probable; and the transaction and derivatives used for hedging were designated in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship. The hedge was initially achieved through foreign currency forward contracts and, following the discontinuation of this hedging relationship, with foreign currency options. This was a transaction-related hedge. The change  in  the  forward  rate  and  the  change  in  the  time  value component were recognized as hedging costs at a point in time. This reduced equity by \u20ac3 million in 2021, and by \u20ac8 million in 2020. Upon disposal of the pigments business as of June/uni00A0 30, 2021, \u20ac11/uni00A0million was reclassified as a reduction in earnings and included in disposal losses from the global pigments business. There was no ineffectiveness at any time during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF used currency options in 2021 to hedge the foreign currency risk resulting from the U.S. dollar-denominated sales price for the sale of the shares in Solenis. These were designated in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship. As this was a transaction-related hedge, the change in the time value component was recognized as hedging costs at a point in time. Accordingly, \u20ac10/uni00A0million was  initially recognized as a reduction in equity. Upon disposal of the shares in Solenis in November/uni00A0 2021, the amount recognized in equity was reclassified to profit or loss and reported under net income from shareholdings. There was no ineffectiveness at any time during the year.\n\nFurthermore, BASF used foreign currency options in 2021 to hedge the Chinese renminbi denominated purchase price for 51% of the shares in BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd. The options used for hedging were designated in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship. This was a transaction-related hedge; accordingly, the change in the time value component was recognized as hedging costs at a point in time.  For this purpose, \u20ac2/uni00A0million was recognized as  a  reduction  in  equity.  Upon  closing  of  the  transaction  in August/uni00A0 2021, the amount recognized in equity as hedging costs was derecognized thereby increasing the purchase price. There was no ineffectiveness at any time during the year.\n\nThe effects of the hedging relationships on the balance sheet, the cash flow hedge reserve, hedged nominal value and ineffectiveness to be determined are presented in the following tables by fiscal year.",

        "page_content": "The occurrence of all forecasted transactions was considered to be highly probable at all times during fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve for commodity  price risks are derecognized against the carrying amount of acquired assets once the hedged transaction occurs. Thus, there is no immediate reclassification of the amounts recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss in these cases.\n\nIn connection with its catalyst production, BASF is exposed to commodity price risks associated with holding physical precious metal items. These production-related precious metal inventories are hedged with forward contracts in accordance with a defined hedging  strategy.  In  2021,  a  portion  of  these  precious  metal inventories  was  designated  in  a  fair  value  hedge  accounting relationship with forward contracts on the precious metals. Changes in the forward rate were considered costs of hedging, and \u20ac2/uni00A0million was recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified successively to profit or loss, being a time-period-related hedge. All hedging instruments expired in 2021. The hedged precious metals were sold. Cash flows in connection with the hedging instruments were recognized in profit or loss in 2021. All hedging relationships were fully effective.\n\n## 27 Statement of cash flows and capital structure management\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nCash  flows  from  operating  activities  contained  the  following payments:\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                             | 2021   |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income taxes                | -1,707 |   -595 |\n| of which income tax refunds | 95     |    273 |\n| income tax payments         | -1,802 |   -868 |\n| Interest payments           | -318   |   -341 |\n| of which interest received  | 151    |    146 |\n| interest paid               | -469   |   -487 |\n| Dividends received          | 711    |    244 |\n\nIn 2021, cash flows from investing activities included \u20ac600/uni00A0million in payments made for acquisitions in connection with the purchase of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co.,/uni00A0Ltd. (2020: \u20ac1,240/uni00A0million for the acquisition of Solvay's polyamide business).\n\nPayments received for divestitures in the amount of \u20ac1,030/uni00A0million were mainly from the sale of the pigments business. That included project-related tax payments of \u20ac65/uni00A0million and special contributions to Swiss pension plan assets of \u20ac43/uni00A0million. Payments received from the  disposal  of  the  equity-accounted  investment  in  Solenis (\u20ac1,066/uni00A0 million) are reported in cash flows from investing activities under payments received from the disposal of noncurrent assets and securities. Gains on divestitures in the amount of \u20ac589/uni00A0million was reclassified from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from investing activities via gains (-) / losses (+) from the disposal of noncurrent assets and securities.\n\nIn 2020, payments received for divestitures resulted in the amount of  \u20ac2,520/uni00A0 million  from  the  sale  of  the  construction  chemicals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness. These included tax payments in the amount of  \u20ac150/uni00A0million  that were directly associated with the transaction. Further tax payments were accounted for in the amount of \u20ac31/uni00A0million in 2021.\n\nFor more information on acquisitions and divestitures, see Note/uni00A03 from page/uni00A0207 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPayments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to \u20ac3,532/uni00A0million, \u20ac403/uni00A0million higher than in the previous year.\n\nIn 2020, BASF/uni00A0SE transferred securities in the amount of    \u20ac401/uni00A0million  to  BASF  Pensionstreuhand/uni00A0 e.V.,  Ludwigshafen  am  Rhein, Germany. This transfer was not cash effective and therefore had no effect on the statement of cash flows.\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand and bank balances with maturities of less than three months.\n\nThe cash and cash equivalents presented in the  statement of cash flows may deviate from the figures in the balance sheet if the  relevant amounts  were  reclassified  to  assets  of  disposal  groups.  As  of January/uni00A0 1, 2021, cash and cash equivalents in the amount of \u20ac4,335/uni00A0million reported in the statement of cash flows consisted of the balance sheet value (\u20ac4,330/uni00A0million) and the value reclassified to the pigments business disposal group (\u20ac5/uni00A0 million). No cash and cash equivalents were reclassified to the disposal groups as of December/uni00A031, 2021; their  balance in the statement of cash flows is therefore identical to that in the balance sheet. As of January/uni00A01,/uni00A02020, cash and cash  equivalents in the amount of \u20ac2,455/uni00A0million reported in the statement of cash flows consisted of the balance sheet value (\u20ac2,427/uni00A0million) and the values reclassified to the disposal groups for the construction chemicals business (\u20ac21/uni00A0million) and the pigments business (\u20ac7/uni00A0million).\n\nAs in the previous year, cash and cash equivalents were not subject to any utilization restrictions.\n\nThe reconciliation according to IAS/uni00A07 breaks down the changes in financial and similar liabilities and their hedging transactions into cash-effective and non-cash-effective changes.

The rise was  primarily due to staff increases in Asia  Pacific,  especially  in   connection  with  the  formation  of BASF/uni00A0Shanshan Battery  Materials/uni00A0Co., Ltd., as well as for the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China. The divestiture of the pigments business,  which  comprised  around  2,500/uni00A0 employees,  had  an offsetting  impact.\n\nAs of December/uni00A0 31, 2021, a total of 1,175 employees (2020: 1,137/uni00A0employees) worked at joint operations.\n\nThe development of the number of employees was distributed over the regions as follows:\n\n## Number of employees as of December/uni00A031\n\n|                                    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Europe                             | 67,532  | 68,849  |\n| of which Germany                   | 51,026  | 51,961  |\n| North America                      | 16,753  | 16,948  |\n| Asia Pacific                       | 19,976  | 17,753  |\n| South America, Africa, Middle East | 6,786   | 6,752   |\n| BASF/uni00A0Group                  | 111,047 | 110,302 |\n| of which apprentices and trainees  | 3,028   | 3,120   |\n| temporary staff                    | 2,329   | 2,128   |\n\n## Average number of employees\n\n|                                    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Europe                             | 67,788  | 71,329  |\n| of which Germany                   | 51,144  | 53,080  |\n| North America                      | 16,765  | 18,599  |\n| Asia Pacific                       | 18,464  | 18,719  |\n| South America, Africa, Middle East | 6,799   | 7,326   |\n| BASF/uni00A0Group                  | 109,815 | 115,973 |\n| of which apprentices and trainees  | 2,750   | 2,821   |\n| temporary staff                    | 2,400   | 2,518   |\n\nThe average number of employees decreased to 109,815/uni00A0employees in 2021 (2020: 115,973/uni00A0employees). This decline was primarily due to the divestiture of the construction chemicals business in the previous year and to the divestiture of the pigments business in the year under review. Employees from joint operations are included in the average number of employees relative to BASF's share in the company. On average, these had a total of 1,143/uni00A0employees (2020: 1,055/uni00A0employees).\n\nFor more information on acquisitions and divestitures, see Note/uni00A03 from page/uni00A0207 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n29\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Share price-based compensation programs and BASF incentive share program\n\n## Share price-based compensation programs\n\nIn 2021, the BASF/uni00A0Group continued offering its share price-based compensation  program  (the  long-term  incentive  (LTI)  program), known as Strive!, which was launched in 2020. The share pricebased  compensation  program  known  as  'BOP'  (BASF  Option Program), which had existed since 1999, was offered for the last time in 2020. All option rights granted during the BOP program years remain valid until the end of their respective exercise periods.\n\nGenerally, members of the Board of Executive Directors and all senior executives are entitled to participate in the LTI programs.\n\n## Strive!\n\nStrive! is based on a performance share plan and takes into account the achievement of strategic goals and the development of the BASF share and dividend (total shareholder return) over a period of four years.\n\nParticipation in Strive! is voluntary for senior executives and is linked to  a  share  ownership  obligation.  Strive!  offers  rolling  eligibility, without a deadline for participation. Approximately 700/uni00A0people were eligible to participate in Strive! in 2021. About 90% of eligible senior executives and the Members of the Board of Executive Directors participated.  Unlike  for  senior  executives,  participation  is  not voluntary for the members of the Board of Executive Directors and is outlined in their service contracts. The same plan conditions generally apply to members of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nA Strive! plan includes a four-year performance period with a fixed disbursement date. A target amount is determined at the beginning of each new Strive! plan for every participant. This target amount is converted into a preliminary number of virtual performance share units (PSUs) by dividing it by the average BASF share price in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The number of PSUs that are",

        "page_content": "ultimately  paid  out  at  the  end  of  the  performance  periods  for Strive!2021 and Strive!2020 depends on the achievement of the three  strategic  targets:  growth  (volume  growth  compared  with global chemical production), profitability (increase in EBITDA before special items) and sustainability (CO2 emissions).\n\nAchievement of each strategic target is calculated for each year of the four-year performance period. Upon conclusion of the performance period, the average degree of target achievement for each strategic goal is equal to the arithmetic mean of the degrees of target achievement for the four years. The total target achievement for the respective Strive! plan is determined by adding the target achievement degree for the three strategic targets after having multiplied each by the corresponding weighting factor. To calculate the final number of PSUs, this weighted target achievement is  multiplied by the  preliminary  number  of  PSUs.  The  payment  amount  upon conclusion of the four-year performance period is calculated by multiplying the final number of PSUs by the average BASF share price for the fourth quarter of the last year of the performance  period, plus the accumulated dividend payments in the four fiscal years. The payment occurs in May of the following year and is capped at 200% of  the  target  amount.  The  payment  amount  therefore  not  only reflects achievement of the strategic targets, but performance of BASF's dividend and share price as well (total shareholder return).\n\nA  personal  investment  in  BASF  shares  is  the  prerequisite  for participation in Strive!. Participants are required to own BASF shares amounting to a predetermined percentage of their base salary for the duration of the performance period. A set-up phase applies to first-time participants. During this period, they are required to hold a percentage of shares as their predetermined personal investment. The set-up phase for the 2021 Strive! program ends on December/uni00A031, 2024. The 2021 Strive! program has the same fundamental structure as the 2020 Strive! program.\n\n## Fair value of PSUs and parameters used as of December 31, 2021\n\n|                                        |    | Strive! program of the year   | Strive! program of the year   |\n|----------------------------------------|----|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                        |    | 2021                          | 2020                          |\n| Number of PSUs granted                 |    | 892,146                       | 724,405                       |\n| Number of PSUs vested                  |    | 223,037                       | 362,203                       |\n| Fair value including fluctuation / PSU | \u20ac  | 78.59                         | 82.06                         |\n| Fair value excluding fluctuation / PSU | \u20ac  | 88.83                         | 89.04                         |\n| Weighted target achievement            | %  | 158.3                         | 137.5                         |\n| Base price                             | \u20ac  | 57.15                         | 67.85                         |\n\nIn  2021,  the  number  of  PSUs  granted  under  the  2021  Strive! program amounted to 892,146 and under the 2020 Strive! program to 724,405. PSUs vested by the deadline totaling 223,037 for the 2021 Strive! program and 362,203 for the 2020 Strive! program were measured at fair value. Fair value is determined using the BASF share price of \u20ac61.78 on the balance sheet date plus expected dividend payments during the term of the program. The weighted target achievement degrees of 158.3% for the 2021 Strive! program and  137.5%  for  the  Strive!  program  2020  are  also  taken  into account. A fluctuation rate of 4% is assumed in the fair value calculation for senior executives.\n\nThe LTI provision for Strive! rose from \u20ac11/uni00A0 million as of December/uni00A0 31,/uni00A0 2020, to \u20ac48/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021, due to the increased  number  of  vested  PSUs  and  higher  fair  values.  The expense from the addition of provisions totaled \u20ac37/uni00A0million in 2021 and \u20ac11/uni00A0 million in 2020. No provisions were attributable to the disposal groups as of December/uni00A031, 2021, or December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BASF Option Program (BOP)\n\nThe 'BOP' LTI program last offered in 2020, grants virtual option rights. When exercised, the option rights are settled in cash.\n\nParticipation in BOP was voluntary. In order to take part in the program,  a  participant  had  to  make  a  personal  investment: Participants  were  required  to  hold  BASF  shares  representing between 10% and 30% of their respective variable compensation for a two-year period from the granting of the option (holding period). The number of shares to be held was determined by the amount of variable compensation and the volume-weighted average share price on the first trading day after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nParticipants received four option rights per invested share. Each option consists of two parts, right A and right B, which may be exercised if defined thresholds have been met: The threshold of right/uni00A0A is met if the price of the BASF share has increased by more than 30% in comparison with the base price on the option grant date (absolute threshold). The value of right A is the difference between the market price of BASF shares on the exercise date and the base price; it is limited to 100% of the base price. Right B may be  exercised  (relative  threshold)  if  the  cumulative  percentage performance of BASF shares exceeds the percentage performance of the MSCI World Chemicals Index SM (MSCI Chemicals). The value of right/uni00A0 B is the base price of the option multiplied by twice the percentage  by  which  the  BASF  share  outperforms  the  MSCI Chemicals Index on the exercise date. It is limited to the closing price on the date of exercise less the calculated nominal value of the BASF share. Right B may only be exercised if the price of the BASF share equals at least the base price. When a two-year vesting period is over, options granted can be exercised until the end of the respective exercise period. During the exercise period, there are certain times (closed periods) during which the options may not be exercised. Each option can only be exercised in full, and one of the thresholds must be exceeded. If the other threshold is not  exceeded, the other option right lapses. A participant's maximum gain from",

Option rights are nontransferable and are forfeited if the option holders no longer work for the BASF/uni00A0Group or have sold part of  their  individual  investment  before  the  expiry  of  the  two-year vesting period. They remain valid in the case of retirement. For the members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors,  the  long-term orientation of the program was significantly strengthened compared with the conditions applying to the other participants. Members of the Board of Executive Directors were required to participate in the BOP program with at least 10% of their actual annual variable compensation. In view of this binding personal investment (in the form of BASF shares), an extended holding period of four years applies. Members of the Board of Executive Directors may only exercise their option rights four years after they have been granted at the earliest (vesting period).\n\nThe models used in the valuation of the option plans are based on the arbitrage-free valuation model according to Black-Scholes. The fair values of the options were determined using the binomial model. Volatility was determined on the basis of the monthly closing prices over a historical period corresponding to the remaining term of the options.\n\nAs a result of a resolution by the Board of Executive Directors in 2002 to settle option rights in cash, all outstanding option rights under the 2014 to 2020 programs were valued at fair value as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021. A proportionate provision is recognized for programs in the vesting period.\n\nThe  LTI  provision  for  BOP  decreased  from  \u20ac115/uni00A0 million  as  of December/uni00A031, 2020, to \u20ac110/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021, due to lower fair values and a lower number of outstanding option rights. No utilizations were recognized in 2020, whereas \u20ac3/uni00A0 million was utilized in 2021 due to senior executives leaving the company. Income from the reduction in provisions totaled \u20ac2/uni00A0million in 2021. The expense from the addition of provisions totaled \u20ac25/uni00A0million in 2020. \u20ac1/uni00A0 million was attributable to the disposal group for the pigments business as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe  exercisable  options  had  no  intrinsic  value  as  of  December/uni00A031,/uni00A02021, or December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## BASF 'Plus' Incentive Share Program\n\nThe 'plus' incentive share program was introduced in 1999 and is currently  available  to  employees  in  Germany,  other  European countries and Mexico. Simultaneous participation in both the 'plus' program and an LTI program is not permitted.\n\nEmployees who participate in BASF's 'plus' incentive share  program and acquire shares in BASF as a personal investment from their variable compensation. For every 10/uni00A0BASF shares purchased in the program, a participant receives one BASF share at no cost after one, three, five, seven and 10/uni00A0years of holding these shares. As a rule, the first and second block of 10/uni00A0shares entitles the participant to receive one BASF share at no extra cost in each of the next 10/uni00A0years.\n\nThe right to receive free BASF shares lapses if a participant sells the individual investment in BASF shares, if the participant stops  working for a Group company or one year after retirement. The number of free shares to be granted has developed as follows:\n\n## Number of free shares to be granted\n\nShares\n\n|                             | 2021      | 2020      |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| As of January/uni00A01      | 3,251,576 | 3,025,462 |\n| Newly acquired entitlements | 498,765   | 942,685   |\n| Bonus shares issued         | -547,960  | -490,050  |\n| Lapsed entitlements         | -123,258  | -226,521  |\n| As of December/uni00A031    | 3,079,123 | 3,251,576 |\n\nThe free shares to be provided by the company are measured at the fair value on the grant date.

        "page_content": "## Glossary and Trademarks\n\n## C\n\n## CO2 equivalents\n\nCO2 equivalents are units for measuring the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the greenhouse effect. A factor known as the global warming potential (GWP) shows the impact of the individual gases compared with CO2 as the reference value.\n\n## E\n\n## Eco-Efficiency Analysis\n\nThe Eco-Efficiency Analysis is a method developed by BASF for assessing the economic and environmental aspects of products and processes. The aim is to compare products with regard to profitability and environmental compatibility.\n\nF\n\n## Formulation\n\nFormulation describes the combination of one or more active substances with excipients like emulsifiers, stabilizers and other inactive components in order to improve the applicability and effectiveness of various products, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, agri cultural chemicals, paints and coatings.\n\n## G\n\n## Genome editing\n\nGenome  editing  refers  to  a  series  of  new  molecular  biological methods to make specific changes in the genome. Naturally occurring processes are used to make small changes to an organism's genes to modify a specific characteristic. Such techniques have great potential for innovative solutions in healthcare, agriculture and industrial applications, for example.\n\nP\n\n## Peak sales potential\n\nThe  peak  sales  potential  of  the  Agricultural  Solutions  pipeline describes the total peak sales forecast for individual products in the research and development pipeline. Peak sales are the highest sales value to be expected from one year. The pipeline comprises innovative products that have been on the market since 2021 or will be launched on the market by 2031.\n\nS\n\n## SEEbalance \u00ae\n\nSEEbalance \u00ae is  the  Socio-Eco-Efficiency  analysis  developed  by BASF. It can be used to evaluate and compare the environmental impact, costs and social aspects of products and manufacturing processes. SEEbalance \u00ae makes sustainable development measurable  and  manageable  for  companies  by  combining  the  three dimensions of sustainability - economy, environment and society in an integrated product assessment tool.\n\n## Steam cracker\n\nA steam cracker is a plant in which steam is used to 'crack' naphtha (petroleum) or natural gas. The resulting petrochemicals are the raw materials used to produce most of BASF's products.\n\nT\n\n## Traits\n\nTraits are commercial plant characteristics, such as an inherent resistance to certain herbicides or an inherent defense against certain  insects.\n\nV\n\n## Value chain\n\nA value chain describes the successive steps in a production process: from raw materials through various intermediate steps, such as transportation and production, to the finished product.\n\n## Verbund\n\nIn the BASF Verbund, plants are intelligently connected. In this system, chemical processes consume less energy, produce higher product yields and conserve resources. The by-products of one plant serve as feedstock elsewhere, creating efficient value chains/uni00A0from basic chemicals to high value-added solutions such as coatings or crop protection products. Our Verbund concept - realized in production, technologies, the market and digitalization - enables innovative solutions for a sustainable future.\n\n## Trademarks a\n\n## Net Promoter System \u00ae\n\nRegistered trademark of Bain & Company, Inc.\n\n## Responsible Care \u00ae\n\nRegistered  trademark  of  the  European  Chemical  Industry Council\n\nAll  other  trademarks  referred  to  in  the  BASF  Report  are registered trademarks of the BASF Group (identified with the \u00ae /uni00A0 symbol), trademarks pending (identified with the TM symbol), or trademarks used by the BASF Group.\n\n- a Trademarks are not registered/used in all countries.\n\n<!-- image -->",
