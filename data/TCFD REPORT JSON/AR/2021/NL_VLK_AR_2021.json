The official annual report, including the audited financial statements and the auditor's opinion thereof, are included in the single report package which can be found via media.vanlanschot.nl/media/xbrl/vlk-2021-12-31-en.zip.\n\nIn case of any discrepancies between the website version and the annual report package, the annual report package will prevail.\n\nNote that the auditor's opinion included in the website version does not relate to the website version but only to the official annual report. No rights can be derived from using the website version, including the unofficial copy of the auditor's opinion. Our auditors did not determine (nor do they need to) that the website version is identical to the official version.\n\n## Unrounded figures\n\nAmounts in the annual report may not add up due to being rounded up or down. The total amounts may therefore deviate from the sum of the parts. Percentage changes are based on the unrounded figures.\n\n## Changes to comparative figures\n\nSome amounts may differ from previously published reports; in these cases, explanations are given in the footnotes.\n\n## Acquisition of Mercier Vanderlinden\n\nAt the beginning of July 2021, the acquisition of 70% of the shares in Mercier Vanderlinden was completed. We have therefore included the July-December 2021 figures for Mercier Vanderlinden in Van Lanschot Kempen's 2021 figures.\n\n## Disclosure of Non-financial Information Act\n\nThe Disclosure of Non-financial Information Act is a Dutch regulation that made reporting on a number of non-financial themes compulsory for companies that qualify as large publicinterest entities ( grote organisaties van openbaar belang ) with more than 500 employees. These themes comprise environmental, social and labour issues, as well as anticorruption, bribery and human rights. For each of these themes, companies are obliged to report on the relevant policies, results, risks (including management of these risks) and non-financial key performance indicators. The regulation also requires companies to describe their business models in their annual reports. We provide all of the information required in the relevant parts of this annual report. For transparency purposes only, the reference table in our sustainability supplement provides additional guidance on where to find this information.\n\n## Global Reporting Initiative\n\nCommunicating transparently on our policies and results is an important element of sustainability. To ensure this, our annual report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Comprehensive option. See the GRI content index on our website for further details: vanlanschotkempen.com/en/sustainability/reporting.\n\n## International Integrated Reporting Framework\n\nIn addition to the GRI Standards, we aim to apply the fundamental concepts and guiding principles of the International Integrated Reporting Framework. This annual report employs various elements of the framework, such as our value creation model and materiality matrix, and is partly structured around the types of capital identified by the framework (financial capital, human and intellectual capital, natural capital and social capital). For more information, visit integratedreporting.org/resource/international-ir-framework.\n\n## External assessment\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's sustainability performance is assessed by a variety of external organisations. For more information, see vanlanschotkempen.com/en/sustainability/ reporting.\n\n.",

        "page_content": "## 2021: A YEAR IN REVIEW\n\nWe achieved significant growth in both assets under management and earnings over 2021. Our strategy as a leading independent wealth manager resonates clearly with our clients, and our strong results enabled us to deliver on our financial targets. This despite the lasting impact of Covid-19 on our employees and on society. In addition to strong organic growth, key milestones in the execution of our strategy included the integration of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers in the Netherlands and the acquisition of 70% of the shares in wealth management firm Mercier Vanderlinden in Belgium.\n\n## 2021 for our clients\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur clients continue to be more satisfied with us, as evidenced by an increase in the Net Promoter Score (NPS) to 36 for Private Clients (2020: 26) and 15 for Evi (2020: 5), exceeding our target of 10.\n\nIn line with our strategy, collaboration between client segments is improving. Examples include offering our investment strategies - such as the Kempen SDG Farmland Fund and Kempen Private Markets Funds - to both our private clients and our wholesale and institutional clients.\n\n## Private Clients\n\nAt \u20ac3.8 billion, our Private Clients segment is recording very good net inflows in assets under management (AuM). Our unique advisory proposition combined with our sustainable discretionary management proposition, expert bankers, distinctive offering to entrepreneurs and standout client experience differentiate us from our competitors. Our performance in this segment tells us that our combination of personal advice and real solutions with modern technology and our sole focus on wealth management are working.\n\nTechnology is an integral part of how we provide our solutions to clients, while we continue to maintain our signature personal touch. We have embraced technology to further enhance our service. Our clients can always request a personal meeting at one of our offices, but we're just as happy to talk to them via video call or WhatsApp. We use biometric voice recognition, making it even easier and safer to talk. Meanwhile, our investment app supports our discretionary management and advice propositions.\n\nEvi, our solution for mass-affluent clients, also recorded strong net inflows. Driven by an increase in commission income, Evi contributed to net profit for the first time. We improved both the sustainability profile of Evi investments and the content of our monthly client reports. Examples of the latter include a sustainability webpage and articles about relevant topics for mass-affluent clients.\n\n## Wholesale & Institutional Clients\n\nWithin our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, appetite for less liquid investments continues to increase. An example of how we responded to this demand is the launch of the Kempen SDG Farmland Fund in cooperation with one of our fiduciary clients. Investment strategies such as Global Small-caps and Real Estate also showed strong inflows. However, total net outflow in this segment amounted to \u20ac4.0 billion, mainly due to the loss of two institutional clients both because of mergers with other parties - and outflow in credit strategies.\n\n## Investment Banking Clients\n\nOur Investment Banking Clients segment (formerly: Merchant Banking Clients) enjoyed a strong flow of Corporate Finance/ Equity Capital Markets deals, partly driven by close cooperation with the Private Clients segment. Our strength lies in our focus on selected sectors: real estate, life sciences & healthcare, tech & fintech, renewables and infrastructure; 54 transactions were executed in nine countries across all our sectors. To facilitate transactions, we also executed a limited number of bridge loans.\n\n## 2021 for our employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, we carried out our employee engagement survey that happens once every two years; the survey saw a participation rate of almost 80%. Compared with the 2019 results and with the financial services industry benchmark, almost all categories showed better scores. The survey saw our engagement score increase from 82% in 2019 to 88% in 2021 - which is also 4% better than the industry benchmark. Compared with the 2019 survey, employees' feelings of inclusion have improved the most - from 66% in 2019 to 88% in 2021.\n\nWe started the reporting year with almost all employees working from home. After the summer - with Covid-19 measures temporarily becoming less strict - we adopted a method of hybrid working. This gave us the opportunity to rethink the way we use our office space and to support our employees in their work-life balance. Our office set-up now includes spaces for working collaboratively, working in silence and having a chat over coffee.\n\n.",

        "page_content": "## Well-being and development\n\nDue to the workload and changes in physical working conditions, our focus in 2021 was on employee well-being. Our managers stayed in close contact with their employees while working from home. We offered our employees (online) yoga classes, boot camps and personalised health advice - all on a voluntary basis.\n\nIn addition to health and well-being, development is an important factor in employee engagement. We therefore introduced five key skills: collaboration, embracing technology, client-centricity, adaptability and embracing sustainability - these are important for all colleagues to develop further and help strengthen our identity as a company. We provided learning solutions to help the workforce further develop these skills.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nDiversity is an increasingly important focus area. In order to support a diverse and inclusive culture at Van Lanschot Kempen, we launched a variety of initiatives. For example, we now have a diversity working group and a Van Lanschot Kempen women's network. We have also become a member of Workplace Pride.\n\nBased on our employee engagement survey, we can conclude that we are perceived as an inclusive organisation. However, we still have work to do: for example, on gender diversity among senior staff.\n\n## 2021 for our shareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on the recommendation of the European Central Bank (ECB), and supported by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), we postponed the payment of our 2019 dividend and part of our 2020 dividend. After the ECB and DNB withdrew this recommendation in the summer, we paid out the 2019 and remaining 2020 dividends to our shareholders, totalling \u20ac1.95 per share, in October 2021. We had already paid out a minor part of the 2020 dividend of \u20ac0.20 per share in June 2021. These payouts together amounted to almost \u20ac90 million in total.\n\n## Growth\n\nIn 2021, we saw growth through partnerships and acquisitions, innovation in products and solutions, and gaining ground outside the Benelux region.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growth through acquisitions\n\nDuring the reporting year, we completed the integration of clients, employees and funds from Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, according to plan. We announced the acquisition of this Dutch private bank in summer 2020. Hof Hoorneman's clients are now on our platform and have access to our range of products and solutions.\n\nIn 2021, we entered into a partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden by acquiring 70% of the shares in this Belgian wealth manager. The remaining shares will be acquired within five years. We see this partnership as transformational for our franchise in Belgium, as we have now become a real challenger in the Belgian market.\n\nBoth Van Lanschot Kempen in Belgium and Mercier Vanderlinden showed very strong net AuM inflows in 2021, with a combined total of \u20ac0.8 billion. We've already seen cross-selling opportunities materialising here - for example, offering Lombard loans and Van Lanschot Kempen investment solutions to Mercier Vanderlinden clients.\n\n## Growth outside the Benelux region\n\nIn addition to our growth in the Netherlands and Belgium, we are growing in the rest of Europe as well. Since 2015, we've been active as a fiduciary manager in the United Kingdom, where we benefit from current industry trends. We entered into an agreement with Clara-Pensions platform (consolidator for DB pension schemes), which is expected to strengthen our position in the UK pensions market.\n\nFor our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, we're investing in expanding our distribution efforts via placing agents in Germany, Italy and the Nordics. And last but not least, we're continuing our pan-European approach for our Investment Banking Clients segment.\n\nOur offices in Switzerland - serving wealthy Dutch and Belgian private clients living in Switzerland - also showed strong organic growth of 25% in AuM.\n\n## Growth through innovation\n\nIn cooperation with our client Stichting Pensioenfonds PostNL, we developed the Kempen SDG Farmland Fund in 2021. This new investment solution enables professional investors to focus on global investments in sustainable agricultural land and make regenerative farming an important priority. Insurance companies Dela and De Goudse have also committed to invest in this fund.\n\n.",

        "page_content": "After the success of our first private equity fund, we introduced the Kempen European Private Equity Fund II in the second half of 2021. By year-end, the fund had a committed volume of \u20ac173 million.\n\nAt the end of the reporting year, we started a concept called Independent Wealth Manager Services, which puts our modern IT infrastructure and services at the disposal of independent wealth managers.\n\n## Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with our purpose, our vision on sustainability is to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders, which means that creating financial and sustainability returns must go hand-in-hand. We believe in an active engagement approach together with our private and institutional clients.\n\nIn 2021, we introduced a Sustainability Centre to coordinate our sustainability activities across the company. We also introduced three key themes to focus on in the coming years:\n\n- -Smart and circular economy : helping our investee companies to contribute to a smart, circular and inclusive economy;\n- -Climate and biodiversity : helping our environment to recover faster by contributing to energy transition and biodiversity;\n- -Living better for longer : helping our clients and society to live longer and in better health.\n\nDuring the reporting year, we were able to reduce the carbon footprint of our own organisation by 6.2% per FTE, and of our AuM by 44% per million euros invested. We've also made a commitment to become a net-zero investor as well as setting ambitious new targets and KPIs for further reducing our carbon footprint.\n\n## Organisational changes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, we changed our organisational structure by moving from a business line-driven organisation towards an integrated model. This allows us to work across client groups, use a broader range of products and further\n\nimprove the efficiency of our organisation. This new organisational structure means that our reporting is also according to client segment from 2021. Our client segments are: Private Clients (including Evi), Wholesale & Institutional Clients and Investment Banking Clients.\n\nOn 1 July 2021, the legal merger between Van Lanschot Kempen NV and Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV took effect. The merger helps to optimise the company's capital position and simplify its legal structure.\n\nOn 1 October, Maarten Edixhoven succeeded Karl Guha, who stepped down as Chair and member of the Management Board.\n\n## Recognition through awards and rankings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen was once again recognised for its work with several awards and rankings during the reporting year:\n\n- -Kempen won the award for Best ESG/Sustainable Investing Report 2020 at the Pensions for Purpose Annual Awards in London.\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen won the 2021 FD Henri Sijthoff Prize in the 'Other listed companies' category. The prize is awarded by the country's main financial newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad to companies judged to provide the best financial reporting and communication to investors and the public at large.\n- -For the third year in a row, Kempen Capital Management UK won the Fiduciary Manager of the Year award at Financial News ' 20th annual Asset Management Awards Europe. Kempen was commended for its continued growth of the UK business in the institutional market.\n- -Van Lanschot won the Founders Carbon Network Icoinic Award for best fintech. Our ability to keep up with the times and innovate was noted, including our investment app, client identification via biometric voice recognition and regular stream of new products, such as the Kempen European Private Equity Fund II.\n- -The Kempen Orange Fund received a Gold rating from Morningstar in the \"Aandelen Nederland\" category. Morningstar appreciated the team's qualities, its strong and consistently proven investment process and its excellent long-term track record.\n- -Two of our colleagues won individual awards: Lisanne Smink, Product Owner Business Intelligence and Analytics, won the RightBrains Digital Talent Award 2021; Nikesh Patel, Head of Investment Strategy Kempen UK, was named Investment Manager of the Year at the Professional Pensions Rising Star Awards 2021.

        "page_content": "## WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is the oldest independent financial institution in the Netherlands. With our roots going back to 17th century Antwerp, Van Lanschot Kempen has brought several entities together over time; the common thread that links us all is trade. Our ability to continuously adapt to change is what allows us to succeed, now and in the future.\n\nOur purpose is the preservation and creation of wealth, in a sustainable way, for our clients and the society we serve.\n\nAs a company, we believe that the generation of wealth and its redistribution through taxation are critical to the process of creating and maintaining stable, successful societies. Given that social cohesion necessitates such wealth creation, we believe that wealth management cannot be the preserve of a few but is a necessity for all. We create wealth, economic growth, jobs and tax income via our services to entrepreneurs, as well as contributing to the achievement of societal goals via the preservation and creation of wealth for asset owners, including private individuals and pension funds.\n\nWe believe that wealth is not just about financial assets; essential as these may be, wealth is about all the things that we value in life. In a broader sense, wealth represents the collective wisdom of a society and the cultural norms and values that sustain it. Although our primary objective is to help our clients with the financial aspects of wealth, we endeavour to serve their broader objectives as well.\n\nWe serve clients across the social spectrum and in several segments - Private Clients, Wholesale & Institutional Clients and Investment Banking Clients - as a trusted partner, and to assist them in preserving and creating wealth sustainably. Investing for the long term is no longer just about looking for the greatest returns by a future date; it's about ensuring the liveability of the planet for the generations to come. We believe that in serving the longterm interests of our clients, we can and must contribute to a sustainable world and societal stability.\n\n## Our values\n\nValues are essential to any successful enterprise. We are no exception. These values drive our decision-making process and our Code of Conduct. In turn, they define who we are and what we stand for. As a company, we believe in the following core values:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Entrepreneurial spirit\n\n- -We look for opportunities, even when there appear to be none.\n- -We accept failure as part of the process and are not defeated by it.\n- -We believe in and pursue our goals.\n- -We are able to connect the dots and make things work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Specialisation\n\n- -We accept that one cannot be good at everything.\n- -We believe in expertise.\n- -Specialisation helps us to make choices and to focus.\n- -We appreciate each other's specialist knowledge and employ this optimally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Craftsmanship\n\n- -We believe in the pursuit of excellence.\n- -We strive to be true professionals - knowing our craft inside out.\n- -We have the tenacity and relentlessness to get things right.\n- -We do not accept second best as the outcome in our search for excellence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dedication\n\n- -We believe in the conscious act of committing one's emotional, intellectual and physical capabilities to one's objectives.\n- -We believe genuine dedication enables us to create value for the long term.\n- -We are intrinsically motivated to work hard in providing our services in order to exceed clients' expectations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Discretion\n\n- -We understand that notions of privacy are changing in this era of social media and digital transformation.\n- -We do our utmost to protect and secure our clients' sensitive information in order to truly be their trusted partner.\n- -We believe in the importance of privacy at an individual, institutional and societal level.\n\nThese values define what we do, and help us to serve our clients best.\n\n.",

A combination of three factors led to a boom in the stock markets that started in 2020 and continued into 2021. Central banks, which had already brought in low interest rates and stimulus packages during the 2008 financial crisis, doubled down on these same policies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Governments around the world did the same, pumping financial support into their economies. At the same time, vaccination campaigns in developed markets meant that economies were able to re-open to some extent. The combined effect of these factors led to markets bouncing back higher than ever, improving every quarter during 2021.\n\nAs a result, clients who had invested in the stock markets enjoyed strong returns during the reporting year. On top of this, many business owners were able to sell their companies at high valuations, providing them with additional inflows of liquidity that they sought to invest. Institutional investors also enjoyed buoyant returns from rising markets. And overall, shareholders have benefited from all of this as well.\n\nOn the flip side, inflation is the big question mark for 2022 and beyond: will inflation become more structurally embedded in the real economy? We're seeing a lot of supply chain bottlenecks because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the strong recovery in demand. In addition, there are real shortages in commodities - especially energy - which will no doubt have an effect on Europe's economy.\n\nFrom a social perspective, the combination of the pandemic and the boom in stock markets has continued to highlight inequalities. This is the case in both emerging and developed economies, including in the Netherlands. For those who have assets and own property, 2021 has been a good year. For those who don't, tensions are rising. The housing crisis in the Netherlands has shown how many people on moderate incomes are unable to afford to buy homes in the current housing market. And populist parties with more extreme views (right and left) are gaining traction across Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrom an environmental point of view, the pandemic has been a catalyst for change in the Netherlands and across Europe. The energy crisis in the final quarter of 2021 showed that Europe is too dependent on fossil fuels, mostly coming from foreign countries, and needs to find its own alternative sources of energy. The severe flooding in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany in the summer of 2021 demonstrated the urgency of acting quickly in our own markets. The European Commission has put in place a more ambitious target than ever before under its 'Fit for 55' package: to reduce Europe's net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. And the COP26 summit brought government representatives from across the globe together to set ambitious carbon-reduction targets. Clearly, climate change will be one of the biggest agenda items for the new Dutch government, too.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Client needs\n\nOur client groups - and those we wish to attract - are broad-ranging. They include private clients, such as wealthy and mass-affluent individuals, entrepreneurs and business professionals; wholesale and institutional clients, such as pension funds and insurance companies; investment banking clients in our focus sectors (real estate, life sciences & healthcare, tech & fintech, renewables and infrastructure); and other types of clients, such as charities, foundations and associations. While different client groups have differing needs, we notice some increasingly common themes that run across them all: topics such as holistic advice, creative solutions, sustainable investments and guidance on how to prepare for the future.\n\nGiven the economic developments in 2021, we've seen two main trends among clients. Firstly, many clients have been faced with huge amounts of liquidity. Entrepreneurs, for example, have been selling their businesses for large sums,",

    },
    {
        "page_content": "while corporate clients have seen share prices surge. Deploying this extra liquidity in a persistently low interest rate environment is challenging, which is why all client groups are increasingly looking for relevant solutions.\n\nSecondly, the pandemic triggered a greater level of unpredictability in the market. The economic rebound ended up being faster and stronger than expected, and brought with it other issues such as potential inflation and rapidly rising energy prices. This is prompting both private and institutional clients to seek creative solutions. Coupled with this is an appetite to move from liquid to illiquid investing in areas such as real estate, private equity and land, as clients look for yield and inflation protection. Again, investors are looking for guidance on the different scenarios they may be facing and on how to protect their portfolios against future inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, many clients are becoming more and more aware of sustainability. They're looking not only to fulfil their financial goals, but also to meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the same time. The need for more balance between people, planet and prosperity has never been clearer - and investors are demanding a more sustainable equilibrium, too.\n\nWith the increased liquidity in the market and the demand for creativity and sustainability, the need for a trusted financial guide to look ahead has become even stronger. In this context, professional advice is more relevant than ever. For more information about how we're serving all client groups, see \"Our strategy\" on page 20.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Competitive market and technology\n\nThe competitive landscape features larger universal banks and smaller boutique players. The former are further consolidating, and investing heavily in technology. Following a wave of technological solutions, their clients are having to do more and more online - from contactless payments to use of banking apps. Our clients are demanding this too, of course, but they also expect the personal touch.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the smaller boutique houses within private banking are less developed on the digital side, and are also seeing consolidation. They generally do not have their own in-house asset manager, and instead are only able to offer private wealth management advice. Again, this is a way in which we can differentiate ourselves: with in-house solutions and strategies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Labour market\n\nAlmost two years into the pandemic, a way of working that at first seemed only temporary has now come to define the new normal. As vaccination rates increased and coronavirus cases fell, some employees headed back to their offices but many others did not. Plenty of businesses, including financial services companies, are now using a hybrid way of\n\nworking: giving their employees the option of coming into the office or working from home. And this is a trend that we expect is here to stay. Our challenge in 2021 was to stay connected with colleagues, keep our workforce healthy, both physically and mentally, and maintain our company culture while working from home.\n\nCompetition for talent in the labour market was fiercer than ever in 2021 - not only in financial services but across many industries. Professional services companies all rely on the knowledge and experience of their employees, and there's significant overlap between the financial sector and other (digital) sectors in terms of the skills required. All of this is making it harder than ever to attract and retain the people with the best skills for the job. With physical location and travel becoming less important, this has intensified the competition for talent even further.\n\nLast but by no means least, the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workforce grows with every year that passes. Employees, clients and shareholders continue to see diversity as a high priority. For more information on competition for talent, and on diversity and inclusion at Van Lanschot Kempen, see \"Human and intellectual capital\" on page 30.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory landscape\n\nThe implementation of several regulations was postponed in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but in 2021 the economic impact turned out to be more limited than expected and the vaccination campaign got underway quickly in developed nations. As a result, the regulatory authorities lifted their relief measures and implementation of regulations resumed - albeit with some delays.\n\nThe European Commission proposed its 2021 banking package, of which the main aim will be to adopt Basel IV in the EU. In general, this will increase capital requirements for European banks, although their implementation has been delayed to 2025 and additional transitional arrangements have been introduced. At the same time, we've seen new implementation of the benchmark regulation to replace LIBOR - moving the financial services industry to a different set of approved benchmarks.\n\nMeanwhile, 2021 has been a busy year for sustainability regulations. The probability and impact of environmental risks are coming to the fore, and regulations are catching up fast. In the past, sustainability regulations were primarily about providing transparency and reporting; now, they're also addressing financial institutions' strategy and risk management. Detailed risk management regulation on sustainability risks is expected in the next couple of years. Previously voluntary frameworks, such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), have been adopted by regulators such as De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) to define best practices for financial institutions to proactively address climate risk. And it's expected that frameworks that previously defined best practices will soon move into legislation.\n\nTo that end, the EU is busy laying the foundations for a regulatory framework for sustainable finance, covering investing, banking and insurance. The aim is to develop",

Meanwhile, the Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) came into force on 10 March 2021. While understanding and preparing for the requirements has been no easy task, the SFDR has helped the financial system as a whole to see how it can become more meaningful to society at large and to improve the way asset managers serve and communicate with clients. In January 2023, phase 2 of the SFDR will come into force, requiring much more detailed disclosure of the sustainability impacts of financial institutions themselves and the activities they are carrying out. In addition, meeting the requirements of the new EU Taxonomy will keep listed European companies busy in 2022, as they seek to bring more clarity to end-investors and prevent 'greenwashing'.\n\nIn terms of compliance, we've seen more emphasis on antimoney laundering and prevention of financial crime during the reporting year. Banks are asking more and more questions of their clients, and compliance requirements are increasing. Client due diligence and transaction monitoring remain important priorities throughout the financial services industry.\n\nFor more information about risks, regulations and compliance, see \"Risk and capital management\" on page 57.\n\n## KEY RISK THEMES FOR VAN LANSCHOT KEMPEN\n\nIn addition to the trends and developments that impact our operating environment, as a wealth manager we face specific risks associated with our sector. In 2021, we identified the following key risk themes:\n\n- -Operational risk: Covid-19\n- -Interest rate risk: low interest rate environment\n- -Operational risk: implementing change\n- -Compliance risk: increasing requirements\n- -Information risk: cybercrime and IT security\n- -Sustainability risk: climate change\n\nSee 'Risk and capital management' (page 57) for more details.",

In addition, a group of senior managers proposed the significance of the impact Van Lanschot Kempen has via each of the 20 topics, which was subsequently cross-checked with a panel of external sustainability experts.\n\nOur Management Board determined the significance of the impact Van Lanschot Kempen has via these topics. Impact refers to positive impact and prevention of negative impact, and may be economic, environmental or social in nature.\n\nThe table below and matrix overleaf show the ten topics (out of the 20 in total) deemed most material, based on those topics rated as 'significantly important' by our stakeholders, and on which Van Lanschot Kempen has 'significant impact'.\n\n|   Topic number | Material topic                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|              1 | Profitability and cost effectiveness  | Return on equity, efficiency ratio, and  ability to keep costs under control.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|              3 | Contribution to  clients' wealth      | Positive financial contribution to the  wealth of our clients via our investment,  advisory, lending and investment  banking solutions.                                                                                                           |\n|              6 | Quality of the workforce              | The workforce consists of talented  employees who have the relevant  expertise and required skill set.

        "page_content": "## OUR STRATEGY\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a well-capitalised, profitable, independent wealth manager with a strong specialist position in the market and proud Dutch roots. We believe that our knowledge and experience, our personal, client-focused approach and our unique combination of activities set us apart from our competitors in our selected market segments, while offering growth opportunities.\n\n## Our ambition\n\n- -A leading wealth manager in the Netherlands and Belgium, creating and preserving wealth in a sustainable way;\n\nSupported by our strong client relationships, we aim to be a leading player in our relevant markets and geographies. This means being:\n\n- -The leading wealth management platform for the massaffluent market in the Netherlands, combining online with a personal approach;\n- -The leading fiduciary manager in the Netherlands, and a key challenger in the UK fiduciary market;\n- -A prominent, European-oriented, active investment manager that delivers both financial and sustainable alpha in less efficient and alternative markets;\n- -The preferred trusted adviser in selected sectors in investment banking across Europe;\n- -A wealth manager with a solid risk profile and a moderate risk appetite, aiming to optimise our capital base while leaving room for potential acquisitions.\n\n## Our strategic pillars\n\nEconomic, social and environmental shifts, evolving client needs, technological advances, the labour market and regulatory changes all impact our operating environment. We need to respond to these changes in order to deliver on our strategic pillars:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accelerate growth organically and inorganically\n\nTo remain relevant for our clients and accelerate our organic growth, we believe that we have to truly understand our clients, anticipate their needs and help them to fulfil these needs in a sustainable manner. Instead of searching for a single product or a specific brand, which entails a productled approach, clients are looking for solutions that fulfil multiple needs.\n\nWe aim to engage in further bolt-on acquisitions and larger acquisitions in order to accelerate our growth, increase our scale and benefit from revenue, cost and/or funding synergies. We focus on acquisition opportunities that support our positioning as a specialist player while keeping a balanced asset mix, and consider acquisitions in existing and contiguous markets.\n\n## How we performed\n\nSince 2015, we've successfully expanded our activities with six bolt-on acquisitions/partnerships. Our high postacquisition client retention rates show that clients value our proposition. In 2021, we entered into a partnership with Belgian wealth manager Mercier Vanderlinden by acquiring a 70% stake, through which we became a real challenger in Belgium. Also in 2021, we completed the integration of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, a Dutch private bank.\n\nOrganic growth within our Private Clients segment has accelerated over recent years, with 2021 showing a net inflow of \u20ac3.8 billion. This acceleration is driven by disciplined client servicing as well as tailoring our offering to our clients' needs. Our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment painted a different picture in 2021, showing an outflow of \u20ac4.0 billion - following years of significant growth. This was mainly driven by the loss of two institutional clients - both because of mergers with other parties - and outflow in credit strategies. Within this segment, investment strategies such as Global Small-caps and Real Estate showed good inflows.\n\n## Advance through digitalisation and advanced analytics\n\nChanges in clients' needs and economic developments require us to react quickly. Technology and digitalisation allow us to improve our productivity and service, by speeding up processes, reducing operational errors and improving the availability, quality and interpretation of data. We invested, and will continue to invest, heavily in our capabilities in this area. Digital interaction is crucial as it offers both clients and employees increased flexibility in terms of means of communication and the time needed to communicate.\n\n## How we performed\n\nTechnology is an integral part of how we provide our services to our clients, while we continue to maintain a personal touch. We therefore give our clients the choice whether they want to communicate with us face-to-face, online or by phone - so that the digital is never at the expense of the personal. We also use technology to ensure that our communications are as individually tailored as possible, by using personalised emailing and dashboards to gain insights into our clients' portfolios. We have embraced technology to further enhance our services, one example of which in 2021 was the introduction of biometric voice recognition.",

        "page_content": "Our private bankers now have the right tools in place to ensure better efficiency combined with the highest standards in client service. Examples include dashboards with real-time client information, network screening and opportunity screening.\n\n## Achieve our sustainability ambitions\n\nBeing a sustainable wealth manager with a long-term focus means that we proactively strive to prevent negative consequences for all stakeholders in line with the UN Global Compact, while aiming to create positive long-term financial and non-financial value. We can achieve the most significant social and environmental impact via our client investments. Our ambition is therefore to move towards more sustainable investing, together with our clients. In the future, we intend to raise the bar even higher and make sustainable investing the new normal. To achieve this, we will increase employee awareness and expand our expertise in the area of sustainable investing across the whole organisation.\n\n## How we performed\n\n- -Climate and biodiversity : helping our environment to recover faster by contributing to energy transition and biodiversity;\n\nIn 2021, we introduced three themes through which we can make an impact:\n\n- -Smart and circular economy : helping our investee companies to contribute to a smart, circular and inclusive economy;\n- -Living better for longer : helping our clients and society to live longer and in better health.\n\nDuring the reporting year, we focused our efforts on climate. We were one of the first asset managers to commit to the global Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2020, and we have set carbon footprint reduction targets for 2025, 2030 and 2050. Across our own organisation, our balance sheet and our assets under management, we reduced our carbon footprint during 2021. We also decided to set annual carbon footprint reduction targets, starting in 2022. For our internally managed listed funds and discretionary solutions for private clients, we aim to reduce our carbon footprint by 7% a year in line with the Paris Agreement goals. Although the easiest way to reach this target is to sell our shares in the most polluting companies, we prefer to take the more impactful route by actively engaging as a shareholder with investee companies. By doing so, we expect to facilitate the broader energy transition and create more real-world impact. Our progress can be tracked in our annual sustainability supplement and on our website.\n\n## Act as one to leverage our full potential\n\nIn order to unlock the full potential of our solutions-led organisation for our clients, we must be able to offer solutions that build on the knowledge and expertise of the entire group as well as our open architecture platform. We believe that by providing clients access to the full range of services and products across our segments, we can meet client needs in a sustainable manner.\n\n## How we performed\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, we adjusted our organisational structure, enabling us to work in an even more client-centric way. The new structure helps us better operate across client segments, provide an even broader offering, and further improve the efficiency of our organisation. We serve all our client groups from our Client Management & Origination\n\ndepartment. One example of operating across client groups is the way we offer investment strategies to both our private clients and our wholesale and institutional clients.\n\nAs we believe brand should follow strategy, we took the decision to move to one brand: Van Lanschot Kempen. The single brand strategy strengthens our positioning as a specialist independent wealth manager in Western Europe.\n\n## Attract, develop and retain the workforce\n\nOur people's knowledge, experience and professionalism are key to the way we operate. Investing in our people enables them to embrace both sustainability and new technology. This technology allows us to adopt a more data-driven way of working and decision-making. Together, we must optimise the use of advanced analytics, to embrace new technology and to work in a more agile manner.\n\n## How we performed\n\nWe facilitate and encourage development and training of our existing workforce. In 2021, we defined five key skills: collaboration, embracing technology, client-centricity, adaptability and embracing sustainability - these are important for all colleagues to develop further and help strengthen our identity as a company. We provided learning solutions to help employees develop these skills. For example, our Private Banking Academy ensured that Private Clients colleagues were skilled to the right level; sustainability and compliance curricula were used to train employees; and employees received various training courses to work effectively from home. We continuously hire new people with the requisite skills and capabilities to help drive our development and the changes needed to stay ahead.\n\nAttracting and retaining a diverse workforce continues to be a focus area for us. As a result, the Recruitment department was strengthened, an employer branding campaign was launched, and better use of data was enforced. As well as hiring financial specialists, this also led to us recruiting additional new talent, such as profiles in compliance, sustainability, digital and data. By year-end 2021, our FTEs had increased by 6% to 1,654. In order to support diversity and inclusion on the work floor, we launched several initiatives in 2021. Examples include the introduction of the Inclusion & Diversity Community, joining Workplace Pride, and the launch of the Van Lanschot Kempen Women's Network.",

It is calculated based on training for employees working in the Netherlands, booked via our learning platform, training brokers and digital and IT departments' channels. The latter is a new source, which means that the 2020 figure has been adjusted.\n- 3 The score for this KPI is based on responses to the following statements in the employee engagement survey:\n- 2 The 2020 figure has been adjusted, whereby all mandates that have been successfully completed are now included.\n- - We operate with integrity in our external dealings (with customers, suppliers, etc.);\n- - We operate with integrity in our internal dealings (i.e. with employees);\n- - I think I could report instances of dishonest or unethical practices to the appropriate level of authority without fear of reprisal.\n- 5 Engagement consists of four stages. If it moves to the next stage, a milestone has been achieved. As of 2021, we apply a more stringent definition. In comparison with previous years, we no longer include the first milestone, which was to reach out to the company, meaning that a maximum of three milestones could be achieved per engagement. In line with this more stringent definition, the 2020 figure has been adjusted.\n- 4 The 2020 score has been adjusted due to an expansion of the available data.",

        "page_content": "## OUR VALUE CREATION\n\nWealth enables our clients to achieve their business, personal and social goals. Wealth generation is essential to create and maintain stability in our society. This requires a longterm focus in which environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors all need to be taken into account at the same time as economic factors.\n\nWe are convinced that our purpose - to preserve and create wealth, in a sustainable way, for our clients and the society we serve - can only be fulfilled in a sustainable world. The purpose of the financial services sector is not to generate short-term profit for shareholders, but to create long-term value for all stakeholders. This means that creating financial and sustainable returns must go hand-in-hand. As a wealth manager, we occupy a unique position in the middle of the value chain. On one side, we act as stewards for our clients, helping them to achieve their long-term goals. On the other, we allocate their capital to companies, which should create long-term value.\n\nWe have a large in-house group of high-quality investment professionals. This gives us the opportunity to be active owners of our clients' capital and create financial and sustainable value. Our experience is that the quality of dialogue with the management of our investee companies is more impactful than the size of our position.\n\nWe are continually improving our products and solutions for our clients to make them more sustainable over time. We primarily offer three different types of investment solutions: responsible, sustainable and impact. All our products and solutions are responsible as a baseline: they meet UN and OECD guidelines on human and labour rights, and they meet governance and stewardship standards. We call this 'doing no harm'. Through our sustainable and impact investment solutions, we proactively focus on 'doing good' - aiming to create positive impact. For examples of our sustainable and impact investment solutions, see \"Natural capital\" and \"Social capital\" on pages 35-44.\n\n## Our focus on sustainability themes\n\n- -Climate and biodiversity : helping our environment to recover faster by contributing to energy transition and biodiversity (SDG 7);\n\nAs a society, we need to find a more sustainable equilibrium between people, planet and prosperity. In 2015, the world unified around 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At Van Lanschot Kempen, we will focus our impact on three related themes:\n\n- -Smart and circular economy : helping our investee companies to contribute to a smart, circular and inclusive economy (SDGs 8 and 12);\n- -Living better for longer : helping our clients and society to live longer and in better health (SDGs 3 and 6).\n\n## Our value creation per type of capital\n\n- -Financial capital : Our clients entrust us with their investments, savings and deposits, while our capital providers invest in our shares and bonds.\n\nOur value creation model on the following page provides an overview of our impact and the value we create in the long term. As a wealth manager, Van Lanschot Kempen attracts various types of capital:\n\n- -Human and intellectual capital : Our employees and external parties bring in their knowledge and experience.\n- -Social capital : The network we have as an organisation and the trust that other stakeholders place in us.\n- -Natural capital : These inputs are not included in our value creation model because they are insignificant in our case.\n- -Manufactured capital : Our physical inputs, such as offices, energy, IT and transport.\n\nAs a company, we aim to deploy these types of capital in combination for overall value creation - meaning that we strive to add value via our business model, thereby increasing the total capital or value. Outputs can be both positive and negative.\n\n- -Financial capital: We invest client assets in companies and other organisations, assist entrepreneurs when raising funds, provide investment returns to our own clients and investors, pay salaries to our employees and pay taxes to society. However, there's also the potential for negative outcomes - for example, if poor market performance hits the assets we manage for our clients.\n- -Natural capital: We contribute to natural capital by investing client assets in sustainable and impact funds that contribute to natural or environmental goals such as energy transition and biodiversity. As a result of our investment of client assets and lending activities, however, there may be negative impacts on the environment under certain circumstances, such as waste production, pollution and carbon emissions.\n- -Human and intellectual capital: We contribute to human capital via the hiring, training and development of our employees, but on the flip side are work-related illness and possible redundancies.\n- -Social capital: We preserve and create growth and job opportunities for society by passing on financial capital to companies and other organisations. We increase social capital by investing client assets in sustainable and impact funds that contribute to social goals, such as health and longevity. But as a result of our investment of client assets and our lending activities, and despite our policies and efforts, in some cases there may still be negative social impacts, such as on labour rights, human rights or other social issues in our supply chains.\n- -Manufactured capital : This is not included in our outputs because we do not manufacture goods.\n\nOver the next four sections, we define what each type of capital comprises, describe our approach to it, provide an indication of how we quantify our contribution, and offer concrete examples of how we create value. We are making decent progress on quantifying our value creation in terms of natural capital, and this is our current focus from a strategic perspective. In 2022, we also aim to improve the value creation model in general.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL CAPITAL\n\nWe define financial capital as the pool of funds available to an organisation for use in the production of goods or the provision of services. Funds can be obtained through financing, such as debt, equity or grants, or generated through operations or investments.\n\n## Our approach\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen provides financial services and, as such, creating value via financial capital is our licence to operate. Our profitability and cost effectiveness are important not only to our clients but also to our shareholders, employees, governments/regulators and other stakeholders, including society at large. For more details on our stakeholders' expectations, see page 17.\n\n## Wealth generation for our clients\n\nto make a positive contribution via our investment solutions. They expect risk-rewarding returns that enable the preservation and growth of their financial assets. Our wealth management solutions and investment strategies should also perform well compared with their benchmarks. To achieve this, we have set up professional investment processes that focus on long-term value creation for our investment strategies and the portfolios of our private and institutional clients. Each of our investment strategies uses a process that is best suited to take advantage of the opportunities in its respective sector. We believe in the\n\nvalues of specialisation and craftsmanship, which is why our portfolio managers have the freedom to create and manage a strategy that is in line with their clients' needs and that delivers sustainable value to their clients. These portfolios bring together the collective expertise from teams that focus on fiduciary management, investment strategies, manager selection and portfolio management. Each team plays a pivotal role in the investment process, governance (including clear responsibilities) and optimum use of systems and tools, in order to achieve the most positive outcomes.\n\n## Profitability and cost effectiveness\n\nWe manage our profitability and cost effectiveness through continuous improvement of our processes, and through growth and innovation. Drawing on our multi-year forecast, we have set 2025 targets for our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio, our return on CET 1 capital and our efficiency ratio. We set annual targets for all Van Lanschot Kempen departments as part of our annual budget cycle. These budgets are devised bottom-up, with the input of the businesses challenged and, where necessary, made more concrete in sessions with the Management Board. Target achievement is measured monthly and reported to the Management Board using management reports - including KPI dashboards - and analyses of financial and nonfinancial data and trends.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of financial capital through a number of KPIs:\n\n| KPIs                                                                                              | Targets                 | Performance in  2021   | Performance in  2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| 1.

In 2021, our CET 1 ratio was 23.7%, slightly lower than in 2020 and still well above our target range of 15-17%. We aim to optimise our use of capital, and intend to leave room for acquisitions. Whenever possible, we will also continue to pay out excess capital to shareholders, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nOur return on CET 1 increased to 15.7%, meeting our target. Our efficiency ratio amounted to 68.9%, also meeting our target for the reporting year. More information on the developments underlying this ratio is provided on page 50.\n\n## Return on assets under management\n\nOur wealth management solutions aim to deliver positive performance in the long term, with our investment strategies performing well against their benchmarks. In 2021, the three-year average performances of Private Clients and Evi discretionary management mandates relative to their benchmarks stood at -0.8% and -0.6% respectively (2020: -1.8% and -2.2%). These figures are calculated by comparing the year-end absolute performance of the largest discretionary solutions over the last three years with their respective benchmarks. Although we did not meet our target to outperform our benchmarks, the absolute three-year average performance of these mandates amounted to 11.6% and 11.8% respectively, thereby positively contributing to our clients' wealth.\n\nFor more details on our financial results, see 'Financial performance' on page 46.\n\nOur clients trust us to manage their wealth effectively and",

On the left-hand side, the capital deployed by Van Lanschot Kempen in our business model is listed, divided into separate categories. On the right-hand side, the capital generated is listed, also divided into categories. The items listed in the tables are intended as examples, and should not be used to calculate our overall value creation. We have not included total inputs or total outputs in these tables for two reasons: firstly, the methodology is still too immature; secondly, inputs and outputs of a certain type of capital can also be deployed and transformed into another type of capital. For example, new assets under management (financial capital) can also lead to an increase in social capital if invested in the right solutions.\n\nAs this table shows, our financial capital inputs consist mainly of the savings, deposits and investments from our clients, as well as the funds provided by investors in our shares and bonds. Our financial capital outputs consist mainly of the funds we invest (on behalf of our clients) in companies and governments, the financial investment returns for our clients, and the financing we arrange for our clients. Our shareholders and investors receive dividends and returns as outputs. The outputs for our employees take the form of the salaries they receive. For society at large, the main outputs relate to the taxes we pay. In 2021, we\n\nextended our value creation assessment by including some of the effects of home ownership, which can be linked to the mortgages we provide to our clients.\n\n## New assets under management\n\nOur aim is to help our clients sustain and grow their wealth; part of the way we do this is by introducing them to new, less liquid asset categories to help clients differentiate their investments in a low interest-rate environment. For example, our Kempen SDG Farmland Fund and our Kempen European Private Equity Fund II were both launched in 2021 to give clients access to alternative solutions. Such funds help us attract and grow client wealth, and lead to inflow of assets under management.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn 2021, we employed our financial capital to acquire 70% of the shares in Belgian wealth manager Mercier Vanderlinden. Coupled with our existing business in Belgium, this has made us a real challenger in the Belgian market. From a client perspective, being part of a larger group brings synergies: Mercier Vanderlinden's clients now have direct access to the group's products and solutions. For example, they can now take out a Lombard loan from Van Lanschot Kempen. It's by putting our financial capital to work in this way that we're able to offer new solutions to clients.",

        "page_content": "## Mortgages\n\nBy providing mortgages, we help our clients purchase homes and thereby create various forms of value. We estimate the increased personal wealth of our Dutch clients due to home ownership (compared with renting a property) at \u20ac1,028 million in 2021. Within this estimate, we take into account the interest costs, tax benefits linked to mortgage interest deduction, real-estate taxes for home owners and increases in housing prices - compared with a reference scenario in which our mortgage clients would rent a property. In the coming years, we may refine this reference scenario since many of our clients already own a home before taking out a mortgage with us to purchase their next home. We attribute the increased personal wealth due to home ownership to the \"clients\" stakeholder group.\n\nIn general, home owners invest more in home improvements. This represents a boost to the building and construction sector, which we estimate to be worth \u20ac16 million in 2021. We attribute this value to the \"society\" stakeholder group.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the tax benefits extended to home owners via the mortgage interest deduction scheme reduce tax income for the Dutch government, in comparison with the reference scenario in which our clients would rent a property. We estimate this loss in tax income at \u20ac33 million in 2021, and attribute this to the \"society\" stakeholder group.\n\n## Next steps\n\nBased on our strategy, we have plans in place that will help us achieve the targets listed under our KPIs. One key area of focus is our cost-income ratio: we are successfully increasing our income levels, but containing costs will also be key to our success. We will therefore be keeping close track of this in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## HUMAN AND INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL\n\nWe define human capital as people's competencies, capabilities and experience; their motivation to innovate; their ability to understand, develop and implement our strategy; and their ability to lead, manage and collaborate. We define intellectual capital as organisational, knowledge-based intangibles, including specific expertise and intellectual property.\n\n## Our approach\n\nIn a knowledge and service-based organisation such as ours, people make all the difference. Their professionalism, skills and engagement determine the quality of our service. Well-trained, knowledgeable people not only provide better service to our clients; they are also more engaged in what they do. And the rapid pace at which digitalisation and technology are developing makes the need for continuous learning even stronger.\n\n## Attracting, retaining and developing talent\n\nOur strategy is to be an attractive and inclusive employer for all talent sources available in the labour market. We continuously strive to recruit a diverse range of talented professionals. Instead of looking for individuals on a caseby-case basis, our aim is to create a continuous flow of new talent. We believe one of the reasons employees choose Van Lanschot Kempen over our competitors is because of the broader and deeper level of responsibility we are able to offer them. To retain our employees, we provide opportunities to grow, a diverse and inclusive culture, competitive and inclusive labour conditions and our Vitality Programme.\n\nThrough our online learning platform - accessible to all Van Lanschot Kempen employees - we provide an integrated educational programme that fits with our strategy. The platform helps employees and their managers to see what is expected of them, and what knowledge and skills they have yet to attain or develop.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of human and intellectual capital through a number of KPIs:\n\n| KPIs                                                                                                                                                        | Targets                 | Performance in  2021   | Performance in  2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| 5.

In 2021, we carried out our employee engagement survey that happens every two years; the survey saw a participation rate of almost 80%. Compared with the 2019 results and with the financial services industry benchmark, almost all categories showed better scores. The survey saw our engagement score increase from 82% in 2019 to 88% in 2021 - which is also 4% better than the industry benchmark. Compared with the 2019 survey, employees' feelings of inclusion have improved the most - from 66% in 2019 to 88% in 2021.\n\nWe added the Global High-Performing Companies benchmark to our survey, both to understand where we stand in comparison, and to set a strong future reference point on employee experience to work towards. On four of the 14 main categories (Inclusion, Trust, Retention and Voice), Van Lanschot Kempen already exceeds this benchmark. The scores on the other ten categories provided useful external insights for our improvement plans.\n\nComing out of the survey, areas that need attention include continuing to make our internal processes more efficient and increasing the speed of moving from idea to implementation. These outcomes will be further analysed and action plans will be drawn up.\n\nAt 13, the Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is significantly higher than the 6 scored in 2020 and the target of 10. This is a strong outcome and a sign that employees feel connected to the organisation. The eNPS is a method used to measure employee satisfaction and loyalty to our organisation, based on the percentage of employees who are promoters of the organisation, minus the percentage of employees who are detractors.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nAttracting and retaining a diverse workforce continues to be a focus area for Van Lanschot Kempen. We aim for diversity in terms of ethnic background, religion, sexual orientation, gender and so on. The gender balance in management positions changed slightly in 2021: 22% of employees in management positions are female, below our target range.",

        "page_content": "In September 2021, the Dutch government passed a law regarding a more balanced ratio of seats between men and women on the management and supervisory boards of large public and private companies, which came into force on 1 January 2022. Van Lanschot Kempen complies with the requirement that at least one-third of our Supervisory Board consists of women and one-third of men. On our Management Board, we aim for at least one-third of members to be women and one-third men. And we aim for 30% women and 30% men in the three levels immediately below the Management Board (senior staff). This is an expansion of our current metric for gender balance, which reflects our ambition to build our talent funnel. In 2022, we will pay attention to developing our mid-level talent pipeline, as this can be an effective lever to increase the representation of women in senior leadership positions in the longer term. We believe in the merits of a diverse organisation, and so we intend to take significant steps in the short and medium terms to achieve our ambitions.\n\nWe have already started to take action to address the representation of women in senior leadership roles. In 2021, we established a working group involving representatives from across different client segments to investigate the barriers that need to be addressed to facilitate the retention and promotion of women at the company. Actions have been defined across four key themes, and will be implemented over the coming period:\n\n- -Communication and awareness;\n- -Levelling the playing field;\n- -Recruitment and retention;\n- -Workforce planning.\n\nWe apply a differentiated (stages of life) approach to eliminate the practical barriers (such as childcare and flexibility) that are encountered by working parents. For instance, we offer flexible working hours, working locations and remote working options for our employees.\n\nWe continue to refine the approach we take to attract diverse talent, including the use of external recruitment agencies to build talent pools. Development and promotion opportunities for existing talent is fundamental to our retention strategy, as is an inclusive environment. In order to support a diverse and inclusive culture at Van Lanschot Kempen, a variety of initiatives were launched during the reporting year. For instance, we now have a diversity working group, a Van Lanschot Kempen Women's Network and a Pride Network. We have established a number of external partnerships, including with Women Inc. and Workplace Pride, both of which focus on creating more inclusive workplaces. Throughout 2021, we put significant effort into initiatives relating to creating an inclusive culture: over 150 colleagues joined language training courses (both business English and conversational Dutch) and we hosted over 20 sessions on inclusion and bias awareness.\n\nWe continue to communicate about inclusion and diversity, regularly publishing stories from our colleagues internally. For instance, in 2021 the Management Board spoke about the importance of hiring people with a disability; our colleagues in the London office talked about the increasing importance of diversity from the perspective of our clients; and other colleagues shared their personal experiences of diversity, taking experience and background into account.\n\nDuring the reporting year, we assessed our HR policies from a gender-neutral perspective. We also amended our policy on desirable and undesirable behaviour, including sexual harassment.\n\nIn line with our core values, we support the principles of both equal opportunity and equal pay (in comparable positions). As a fundamental value, we do not discriminate. In 2021, we engaged an external party, AnalitiQs, to carry out an in-depth analysis to test the assumption that we adhere to the principles of equal opportunity and equal pay. The scope included all internal employees in the Netherlands. In the methodology used, a correction was made for pay gaps that are caused by differences in age, job level and tenure, for example. The results of this analysis indicated an unexplained (corrected) pay gap of 4%; for comparison purposes, the Statistics Netherlands (CBS) average is 5.5% and the average for Dutch financial institutions is 13%. In order to address this gap where needed, we make adjustments as part of our regular compensation process.\n\nFollowing the initiatives we rolled out in 2021, our employee engagement score on the topic of inclusion and diversity significantly increased, by 22 points overall compared with 2019. It's clear that we find this topic important as an organisation, and we will continue to build on this momentum in 2022.\n\n| Key staff data                                                                   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employees (FTEs at year-end)                                                     | 1,654  | 1,564  |\n| Absenteeism (%)                                                                  | 2.2    | 2.3    |\n| Investment in training (\u20ac million)                                               | 2.9    | 2.0    |\n| Training hours (estimated total number of  hours, individually and collectively) | 90,800 | 84,000 |\n| Female/male ratio (%)                                                            | 32/68  | 33/67  |\n| Staff turnover (%)                                                               | 5      | 5      |\n\n| Staff per client segment          | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|\n| at year-end (FTEs)                |        |\n| Private Clients                   | 587    |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients | 43     |\n| Investment Banking Clients        | 107    |\n| Other                             | 917    |\n| Total                             | 1,654  |",

We aim to add value to these human capital inputs through our business model - for example, by creating attractive jobs that result in additional social value for our employees. However, such outputs can also be negative - as in the case of work-related illnesses. Note that the table contains only three examples so far; we expect to add more data in the future, including figures on workplace diversity, work experience and training, for instance.\n\n## Opportunity costs of work\n\nEconomists have developed various methods to assign a monetary value to the time employees spend working. These methods all have pros and cons. A downside to many methodologies is that they are not based on a reference scenario in which employees conduct other paid work. Since employees generally require an income to maintain their livelihoods, this would be more valid than comparing the average monetary value an employee assigns to one working hour with one leisure hour. We therefore continue to explore methodologies to assign value to the input of human and intellectual capital in terms of the opportunity costs of work.\n\n## Social value of having work\n\nNumerous studies show that people with a job are more satisfied with their lives than people without one. Several of these studies also focus specifically on quantifying this social value, usually by means of a \"well-being valuation\". Through this econometric method, developed to measure the value of so-called non-market goods, we can determine the monetary value of increased life satisfaction as a result of having a job. Based on the formula developed by Fujiwara (2019) 2 , the social value of all jobs at Van Lanschot Kempen in 2021 amounted to \u20ac19.1 million - attributed to employees - compared with \u20ac16.3 million in 2020.\n\n## Work-related illness\n\nIn contrast to the social value of having work, the negative impact of work-related illness on employees' quality of life is also reflected in our contribution to human capital and social value. To calculate this, we use the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) method developed by the World Health Organization. A DALY is an international measure of missed happiness in life due to illness. In short, every healthy year of life counts for 1 DALY, and the DALY is lowered for each year in which an employee is ill by using a weighting factor.\n\nWe combine this data with illness-related absentee data for the average Dutch employee (from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment - RIVM) and the value of one year of life (from CE Delft, an independent research organisation) to calculate the total impact.\n\nBased on this calculation, the total negative impact from arm, neck and shoulder complaints, back pain and burnout in 2021 amounted to \u20ac1.6 million, compared with \u20ac1.5 million in 2020.\n\n## Other achievements and developments\n\n## Employment conditions and working from home\n\nAs a result of the harmonisation and modernisation of employment conditions in 2020, several benefits were introduced, such as the partially paid sabbatical and extended care leave. We also introduced the part-time early retirement policy: from the age of 60, employees can work part-time and keep their full pension accrual. These new benefits are highly appreciated by our employees and are already being taken up.\n\nWhile employees were working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic, we provided a number of tools to help colleagues manage their work-life balance. For instance, to boost health and well-being, we offered online workouts, breathing exercises and yoga classes. To manage a healthy work-life balance, we offered time management training and webinars on health and well-being, focusing on how to deal with increasing work pressure and stay connected with colleagues. We trained our managers on staying healthy as leaders, and how to talk about Covid-19. And, on a regular basis, we asked our employees about their well-being through pulse surveys or sent them gifts by way of recognition for their flexibility.\n\nWe invested not only in health-related support, but also in high-end facilities for working from home. We made budget available so that employees could get the IT infrastructure and hardware they needed to ensure their home offices met their personal needs. We also transferred part of the commuting costs to a healthy working from home and wellbeing budget. The purpose of this budget was to provide our employees with a pleasant home environment that supports their physical and mental health. This was in addition to home technology: we became even more digitally focused, offering training on digital tooling.",

        "page_content": "Starting on 1 September 2021, we introduced our renewed flexible, sustainable and future-proof commuting expenses scheme, which has been expanded. Our employees can travel from home to any office location in whichever way they prefer; all their commuting costs are reimbursed regardless of whether they go by public transport, by bike or on foot. We promote driving electric lease cars, and are working on a new sustainable lease car policy to be implemented in 2022. You can see examples of some of the ways in which our employees commute to work in the testimonials throughout this report.\n\nFollowing an election, the Works Council has had a new set of members since October 2021. We are proud that our Works Council is representative of our company. The cooperation process with the Works Council is always constructive.\n\n## Integrated employment practices\n\nStarting in January 2020, we implemented a new defined contribution pension scheme for all employees. The first collective value transfer was accomplished at the end of 2020; the second collective value transfer was successfully concluded in 2021. In 2022, we have a third collective value transfer scheduled for our new colleagues from Hof Hoorneman Bankiers. We also plan to improve pension awareness among our employees and encourage them to start preparing for the future.\n\nIn our Belgian business, we spent time upgrading our HR practices to be in line with the Dutch organisation: we have formalised the job and career framework, and made significant investments in leadership.\n\n## Continuous learning culture\n\nTo build our continuous learning culture, we create ongoing, on-the-job learning opportunities for all employees. We promote inquiry and dialogue: creating a culture in which feedback and experimentation are encouraged. And we promote and reward collaboration and social learning.\n\nIn 2021, to promote our continuous learning culture, we reintroduced 360-degree feedback tools for all employees. We also updated our Private Banking Academy with new modules. Lastly, we took initial steps towards creating our new Digital & IT Academy, which will help train the next generation of tech professionals.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn 2022, we will continue to work on attracting and retaining the high quality of talented professionals we need to achieve our growth strategy. Not only through new recruits, but also through succession planning to ensure that existing talent is ready to be promoted to the next level in the organisation. Diversity will continue to be both an important priority and an opportunity to improve and differentiate ourselves.",

        "page_content": "## NATURAL CAPITAL\n\nWe define natural capital as all renewable and non-renewable environmental resources that support the prosperity of an organisation. Natural capital includes air, water, land, minerals, forests, biodiversity and ecosystem health.\n\n## Our approach\n\nAs an organisation, we impact natural capital through our daily operations, for which we consume energy, and use water and other inputs that harm the environment. Moreover, as a financial institution, we also have a wider indirect impact: through our investments and financing, we facilitate other organisations in conducting their operations, which also make an environmental impact. As a responsible organisation, investor and wealth manager, we are conscious of these impacts and aim to reduce them. By offering sustainable and impact investment solutions, we also specifically contribute to natural or environmental goals such as energy transition and biodiversity.\n\nTo limit the impact of our assets under management, balance sheet and activities, we have various policies in place covering impacts on natural capital. Our main focus is to limit our contribution to climate change, as this is currently the most material risk to society. In 2021, for the first time we also assessed our exposure to risks resulting from the loss of biodiversity. Climate and biodiversity will be two of the themes on which we will focus more over the coming years.\n\n## Responsible and sustainable investment\n\nGiven the size of our assets under management, the biggest environmental impact we make relates to how we invest our clients' assets. We therefore have an extensive responsible investment policy in place for all assets under management. This policy is developed and implemented internally, and is based on a long-term, focused investment philosophy coupled with an active ownership approach. We believe that an actively managed investment portfolio will create the most value in the long term, in both financial and non-financial (environmental, social and governance - ESG) terms. We engage with fund managers and investee companies on a broad range of ESG topics, including environmental issues, and we exercise our voting rights at annual general meetings. If fund managers or investees are not willing to comply with our minimum environmental standards, we may choose to divest. In addition to our responsible investment approach, we offer sustainable solutions. These contain more exclusion criteria and a bestin-class approach.\n\nAs part of our responsible and sustainable investing, we also have a climate policy that was significantly strengthened in 2020, with a long-term commitment to be a net-zero investor (by 2050), as well as mid-term (2030) and shorter-term (2025) objectives.\n\nTo monitor our progress on our objectives to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, in 2021 we translated our ambitions on carbon reduction into KPIs across the organisation for 2022. We also signed the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative to confirm our commitment to become a net-zero investor by 2050. In 2021, together with other asset managers, we reconfirmed our commitment and ambition, which was published during COP26 in Glasgow.\n\nWe believe biodiversity loss represents a systemic risk to society and the environment. We are determined to consider both the risks and opportunities this presents to our clients, and to human and planetary well-being. In 2021, we therefore drew up an explicit biodiversity policy, and we are committed to enhancing our approach on this focus area, which includes working together with industry groups on methodologies and metrics, further integrating biodiversity into our investments, and developing our policies to explore more risk assessments. For more information on our biodiversity policy, see kempen.com/en/ asset-management/esg/policies-and-publications.\n\nMore information about our responsible investment approach can be found on kempen.com/en/assetmanagement/esg.\n\n## Responsible and sustainable banking\n\nWe have carbon reduction targets in place for the portfolios we manage. In addition, we have set annual targets to reduce the carbon footprint of the investments on our own balance sheet and of the mortgages that we have granted. Our objective is to stay in line with carbon reduction goals that are aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Acting as a good corporate citizen\n\nWe have already been measuring and reducing our own carbon footprint for more than a decade. Starting in 2022, we are significantly increasing our carbon reduction target from 2.5% per FTE per year to 7% per FTE per year.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of natural capital through a number of KPIs that you can see on the following page.",

In line with various standards in the marketplace, we categorised these according to five levels of sustainable investing: 1) compliant; 2) basic; 3) responsible; 4) sustainable; and 5) impact. In 2021, the percentage of fund managers on our approved list that met our criteria for responsible, sustainable and impact investing was 76%.\n\nDuring the reporting year, this list of rated funds was extended to include funds outside the approved list. By year-end 2021, we had screened 387 funds against the criteria for these categories (2020: 147 funds), accounting for 57% of our AuM. When we include assets from fiduciary clients (as well as private clients) as a percentage of assets under management, the scores are: 0% compliant, 9% basic (primarily passive funds), 64% responsible, 25% sustainable and 2% impact.\n\nIn 2021, we undertook 132 direct engagements for change and awareness with individual companies, which means we met our annual target of 80-100 cases. At least one milestone was reached for 55 engagements in 2021 2 , meaning that at least one pre-defined goal of the engagement was achieved, thereby exceeding our target of 10-15 per year. This is primarily a consequence of the additional engagements we have initiated over the past few years.\n\nIn addition to these direct engagements with companies, we also conducted 204 collaborative engagements with companies and 47 dialogues with external fund managers. In addition, we voted at 437 meetings, or 96% of all votable meetings (2020: 419 meetings, 96%).\n\nOur progress on improving our responsible investment policies and our sustainable and impact investment solutions, as well as enhancing our responsible investment capabilities, is demonstrated by the improved ranking of Pensioenfonds PostNL, of which we are the fiduciary manager, on the VBDO Benchmark Pension Funds.\n\nWith our support, Pensioenfonds PostNL was able to improve its ranking from 21 out of 50 in the 2020 ranking to 6 out of 50 in the 2021 ranking. This makes it the highest ranked pension fund in the category of \u20ac10-30 billion in AuM, and the highest-scoring corporate pension fund in the Netherlands.\n\n## Carbon footprint\n\nIn 2021, the aggregate carbon footprint of our assets under management was 3.6 million tonnes (2020: 4.9 million tonnes). This reflects the fact that our assets under management are increasingly in sustainable investments, which have lower carbon intensities. We see this development in both the Private Clients and the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segments.\n\nThe total carbon footprint of the assets on our balance sheet decreased from 54,383 tonnes in 2020 3 to 51,061 tonnes in 2021. This was mainly due to reductions in the carbon footprint of our corporate banking loan book and mortgage portfolio. These reductions are likely due to the pandemic-related lockdowns over the course of 2020 as well as energy-efficiency measures taken by our clients in 2020. As the data on energy consumption by businesses and households that we use to determine this part of our carbon footprint is only available one year later, these 2020 developments have an impact on our 2021 figures.\n\nWe remain on track to reduce our carbon emissions by an average of 2.5% per FTE per year, and in 2021 we met this target under our existing KPIs. However, we also set a new, more ambitious target under our 2022-23 KPIs of a 7% reduction per FTE per year, using 2019 as our baseline. For more information, see our sustainability supplement.\n\nIn our own organisation, our absolute carbon emissions in 2021 totalled 1,984 tonnes, or 1.10 tonnes per FTE (2020: 1,965 tonnes, or 1.17 tonnes per FTE). The slight absolute increase can be explained by the smaller impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in terms of how we conducted our daily operations in 2021 compared with 2020. Our relative emissions per FTE decreased because of the higher number of employees. In addition, we continued to offset all the remaining carbon emissions from our own organisation. Note that the figures relating to the carbon emissions of our own organisation exclude Mercier Vanderlinden.",

By comparison, the value of our natural capital input is limited. Van Lanschot Kempen's primary inputs come from financial capital streams, and are transformed into natural capital outputs. In future, we aim to expand our assessment to gain more insight into these natural capital outputs.\n\n## Our client investments and natural value creation\n\nIn 2021, we refined our methodology to quantify the natural capital outcomes of our clients' assets, which we had started quantifying in 2020. As shown in the table above,\n\nthe natural capital alignment of all our sustainable equity funds in aggregate (\u20ac1,081 million) is estimated at \u20ac7.3 million (2020: -\u20ac1.8 million).

One example is the Kempen SDG Farmland Fund that we launched in 2021 in cooperation with our client Stichting Pensioenfonds PostNL. This fund aims to invest in land for sustainable agriculture across the globe, and to deliver attractive long-term returns to its investors in the process.\n\nFollowing the launch of the Kempen SDG Farmland Fund, two insurance companies, Co\u00f6peratie DELA and De Goudse, also joined the fund. At year-end 2021, the fund had a committed volume of over \u20ac380 million.\n\n## Our EU Taxonomy eligibility\n\nIn 2021, the European Commission published the first specific requirements to which we need to adhere. This EU Taxonomy provides a common classification system by which economic activities, loans or investments that facilitate these activities, are considered \"green\". During the reporting year, we assessed the eligibility of the assets on our balance sheet against the EU Taxonomy for the first time. Our disclosure is limited to \"eligibility\" as opposed to \"alignment\", in accordance with regulations, because investee companies were not yet obliged to report on how their activities were aligned with the EU Taxonomy over 2020. By marking assets on our balance sheet as \"EU Taxonomy-eligible\", we denote that these have been",

To improve our reporting on the EU Taxonomy eligibility of the assets on our balance sheet (as well as the EU Taxonomy alignment of these assets from 2023) and to facilitate risk management, we will: collect additional data on the energy efficiency of the residential real estate we finance; gather more information on the size and activities of family businesses, healthcare and business professionals, and other entrepreneurs we finance (included in Other private banking loans); and collect data on the EU Taxonomy eligibility and alignment of the entities in which our own funds and external fund managers invest.\n\nAt year-end 2021, \u20ac6,727 million out of our total \u20ac16,353 million in assets on our balance sheet was EU Taxonomy-eligible.

The share of assets on our balance sheet that is not eligible comprises the categories that are not in scope for the EU Taxonomy: 25.1% of total assets on our balance sheet is exposed to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers; 1.5% comprises derivatives; and 17.5% is exposed to undertakings that are not obliged to publish non-financial information pursuant to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD).\n\n| Summary of EU Taxonomy eligibility of activities                          | Total gross carrying  amount (in \u20ac million)   |   Total assets (%) | GAR assets (%)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Exposures to EU Taxonomy-eligible economic activities                     | 6,727                                         |               41.1 | 55.0             |\n| Exposures to EU Taxonomy-ineligible economic activities                   | 4,446                                         |               27.2 | 36.4             |\n| - of which exposures to undertakings that are not in scope of the NFRD    | 2,860                                         |               17.5 | 23.4             |\n| Derivatives                                                               | 253                                           |                1.5 | 2.1              |\n| On-demand interbank loans                                                 | 102                                           |                0.6 | 0.8              |\n| Other assets not eligible for green asset ratio (GAR) calculation         | 692                                           |                4.2 | 5.7              |\n| Total GAR assets                                                          | 12,220                                        |               74.7 | 100.0            |\n| Exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers | 4,101                                         |               25.1 | -                |\n| Trading portfolio                                                         | 31                                            |                0.2 | -                |\n| Total assets                                                              | 16,353                                        |              100   | 100.0            |\n\nOur EU Taxonomy-eligible assets on our balance sheet comprise our mortgage portfolio and mortgages distributed by third parties: \u20ac6,727 million in total. As a consequence of our wealth management strategy, and compared with other financial institutions, we have a relatively limited portfolio of other loans. This portfolio generally comprises products that are supplemental to our private banking relationship model - for instance, loans provided to family businesses, business professionals, healthcare professionals and entrepreneurs. In the main, these counterparties are not marked as public interest entities - i.e. are not pursuant to the NFRD - and for this reason, these loans are not in scope for the EU Taxonomy.\n\nNote that only a proportion of our EU Taxonomy-eligible assets will also be EU Taxonomy-aligned. For instance, based on reports issued by the European Commission, only mortgages used to finance residential real estate that is within the top 15% in terms of energy efficiency (at least Energy Label A), or that has realised an improvement of 30% in primary energy demand after renovation, can be classified as EU Taxonomy-aligned.\n\nWe have not included our positions in a selection of our own investment funds in our EU Taxonomy-eligible assets. At the time of reporting, only a small sample of the issuers in which these funds hold positions have reported on the EU Taxonomy eligibility and/or alignment of their activities. As these companies will provide more information about the EU Taxonomy eligibility and/or alignment of their activities in their reporting for 2021, we expect to be to be able to provide information on the eligibility of our positions in our own investment funds in our 2022 reporting.\n\nWe have embedded sustainability considerations into all of our products and services. We work continuously to improve the sustainability profile of our current investment products and to develop new sustainable investment products. Over time, this should translate into increased EU Taxonomy eligibility and alignment of the assets on our balance sheet.\n\nFor instance, we offer a sustainability discount via our Groenhypotheek (green mortgage) to clients who want to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. By extending the services we offer to our mortgage clients and the conditions of our green mortgage product, we encourage clients to take energy-efficient measures, such as installing solar panels. Since mortgages represent a large share of the assets on our balance sheet, this could potentially significantly increase the EU Taxonomy eligibility and alignment of the assets on our balance sheet. In parallel, this helps to realise our target on reducing the indirect carbon emissions related to our mortgage portfolio.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn 2021, we made various steps in refining and focusing our policies and targets. In 2022, we aim to implement these policies and further monitor whether we are on track to meet our more ambitious targets. Moreover, we will continue to work on gaining insight into our impact on biodiversity and other forms of natural capital via our assets under management and on our balance sheet. We also aim to develop policies on a smart and circular economy.",

In our case, social capital includes the social impact we make via our client assets.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe preserve and create wealth, growth and job opportunities for society by passing on financial capital to companies and other organisations. Our relationship with clients is one of our most important assets. We increase social capital by investing client assets in sustainable and impact funds that contribute specifically to social goals, such as living better for longer. But as a result of our investment of client assets and our lending activities, in some cases there may be negative impacts, such as on labour rights, human rights or other social issues in our supply chains.\n\n## Responsible and sustainable investment\n\nAs with natural capital, the biggest social impact we make relates to how we invest our assets under management. Our responsible investment policy therefore also covers social issues extensively. We engage with fund managers and investee companies on a broad range of ESG topics, including social issues such as human rights and labour rights, and we exercise our voting rights at annual general meetings. If fund managers or investees are not willing to comply with our minimum social standards, we may choose to divest. In addition to our responsible investment approach, we also offer sustainable solutions. These contain more exclusion criteria and a best-in-class approach.\n\nFor a full description of our ESG policy (including our voting policy and voting records), see kempen.com/en/assetmanagement/esg.\n\n## Ethics and integrity\n\nThe financial sector is built on trust, and a healthy culture and ethical behaviour are needed to sustain this trust with all our stakeholders.\n\nThe Banking Code, with which we comply, sets out principles for sound and controlled business operations, corporate governance, risk management policies, and audit and remuneration policies. As stated in the Banking Code, the Management and Supervisory Boards are responsible for developing and maintaining standards of integrity and ethical behaviour.\n\nOur Code of Conduct, to which every employee must adhere, goes further than complying with relevant legislation. It includes guidelines on how employees should act with integrity and balance the interests of all stakeholders. Our Code also includes the Banker's Oath, which all our employees are required to sign. For more information, see vanlanschotkempen.com/en/governance.\n\nThere are various internal mechanisms for employees who are seeking advice, or for reporting concerns about ethical issues, unethical or unlawful behaviour, and organisational integrity - for example, via their managers and the Compliance department. We have a whistleblower policy and a complaints procedure in place; we have also appointed internal advisers who employees can speak to confidentially.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of social capital through a number of KPIs:\n\n3\n\n| KPIs                                                                                                                        | Targets               | Performance in  2021       | Performance in  2020     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 9.

        "page_content": "## Client relations\n\nThe relationship with our clients is one of our most important assets. To measure their satisfaction and loyalty, we use the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which provides insight into client loyalty and the number of promoters of the organisation. The score lies within a range of -100 to 100 points, the higher the better. The formula is as follows: NPS = % promoters - % detractors. Promoters give the organisation a score of 9 or 10, whereas detractors award a score of between 0 and 6. The NPS that we measure is also known as Relationship NPS. We measure this four times a year for Private Clients and Evi, and once every two years for Wholesale & Institutional Clients.\n\nIn 2021, our private clients 4 awarded us an NPS of 36, higher than our target of 10. This can be attributed to satisfaction about contact with our employees as well as satisfaction regarding our investment services, which could relate to the positive market sentiment.\n\nThe NPS for Evi increased to 15 in 2021, higher than our target of 10. Compared with 2020, Evi clients indicated satisfaction regarding their investment results and the clear and straightforward communication. And 87% indicated it was \"likely\" to \"very likely\" that they would remain a client.\n\nFor the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, we measure the NPS once every two years, as the relationships with - and solutions provided to - institutional clients do not change as quickly as can be the case with private clients. The NPS of 38 awarded by wholesale and institutional clients is above our target of 20. The small increase from 31 in 2019 is mainly thanks to the quality of service and expertise of our employees.\n\nAmong our Corporate Finance clients, building long-term client relationships is measured via the percentage of successful transactions with repeat clients during a year. A client is defined as a repeat Corporate Finance client if they have made a successful transaction with us in the past five\n\n## Quantifying our value creation\n\n## Overview of social capital: inputs and outputs\n\n| Input (\u20ac million)                                | Amount  2021   | Amount  2020 Output (\u20ac million)   | For   | Amount  2021   | Amount  2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------|----------------|----------------|\n| Social capital input has not yet been quantified |                | Client investments (AuM)          | S     | 48.6           | 31.9           |\n|                                                  |                | Other products and solutions      | S     | n/a            | n/a            |\n\nS: society\n\nAs the table shows, our main impact on social capital - both positive and negative - is via the products and solutions we provide. We currently only quantify the impact we make via our client investments. Although we acknowledge that we use social capital as inputs - such as our brand reputation and stakeholder recognition - we still need to quantify these in order to be able to report a monetary amount.\n\n## Our client investments and social value creation\n\nAs with natural capital, in 2021 we refined our methodology to quantify the social capital outcomes of our clients' assets, which we had started quantifying in 2020. Based on our assessment, our sustainable equity funds in aggregate over 2021 (\u20ac1,081 million) made a net positive contribution of \u20ac48.6 million to seven social themes. If the \u20ac1,081 million had been invested in the benchmarks of these sustainable equity funds instead, the social capital alignment would be estimated at \u20ac32.9 million.\n\nyears. The score on this KPI indicates whether existing clients are doing business with us again as well as our ability to acquire new clients. In 2021, 46% of transactions were with repeat clients, below our target range of 60-70%. This was due to the rise in the number of new clients for whom transactions were made, even though the absolute number of recurring clients is higher than in 2020.\n\nClient satisfaction among our Securities clients is measured in a similar way: the percentage of repeat Securities clients paying bundled commission for our research in the past 12 months, compared with the previous 12-month period. Given the importance of building long-term client relationships, the target has been set at 80%. At 94%, the 2021 result is significantly above our target.\n\nA crucial element in our relationship with clients is the extent to which their expectations are met by the quality and effectiveness of our solutions. The quality of our investment strategies is measured via the average Morningstar rating of these strategies in the institutional share class. At the end of 2021, the average rating was 3.6, meeting our target.\n\n## Ethical behaviour\n\nOur approach to ethical behaviour is described on the previous page. We monitor whether our employees positively evaluate our culture regarding ethical behaviour and integrity via employee surveys. Employees are asked to evaluate whether we operate with integrity in both our internal and external dealings, and if they feel they could report dishonest or unethical practices without fear of reprisal. The outcome is benchmarked against other financial services firms (by an external organisation) and was above the industry average at the end of 2021, in line with our target.\n\nIn 2021, two ethical incidents were reported (2020: one incident), which have since been handled according to the relevant policies and procedures.",

We engage on social issues to ensure that companies respect human rights in their operations and supply chains, perform human rights due diligence, ensure payment of living wages and safeguard labour rights. One of the companies that we have engaged where we saw tangible change is Coats Group, which manufactures and distributes industrial threads to the apparel and footwear industry. By conducting a global\n\nanalysis, we discovered that in the case of around 700 employees, or 4% of the workforce, remuneration was above the legal wage minimum but below the living wage benchmark. The company's board approved additional budget to improve the situation. As of 2021, all identified employees in four countries that our engagement focused on are now paid a living wage.

        "page_content": "## Global Impact Pool\n\nThe Global Impact Pool (GIP) is a multi-asset impact fund that aims to realise market-based financial returns and a measurable, positive impact on society and the environment. In 2021, the GIP reached \u20ac133 million (2020: \u20ac108 million). The fund is organised around four themes, of which two directly link to social capital.\n\nOne of these themes is 'basic needs & well-being'. By focusing on this theme, the GIP aims to reach underserved consumers around the world with access to safe drinking water and essential healthcare services. One company in which the GIP invests is MedGenome, which conducts vital research on the human genome. Currently, many global genome projects are based almost solely on the European population. This results in medical treatments that are not always relevant to other population groups. MedGenome is working to solve this problem by researching Indian and Asian human genomes.\n\n## VAN LANSCHOT KEMPEN FOUNDATION\n\n## SPONSORSHIP\n\nWe aim to support community projects that help create a better world for future generations. The activities of the Foundation focus on four themes: financial education and talent development, health, art and culture, and social cohesion via sport. The aim is to make the largest possible positive impact on people who need our support. An important feature of our Foundation activities is that we always seek to combine a financial donation with the - pro bono - deployment of Van Lanschot Kempen staff. By doing so, we hope to make a positive impact on society as well as on our employees. Participation in Foundation activities connects our staff to new people and unfamiliar situations, resulting in new experiences and energy.\n\nAgain in 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic made it difficult to set up physical (in-person) activities in which our staff could participate. To compensate for this and to gain more commitment internally, the Foundation organised a competition among employees to select a charity project to be supported by their own department. The more employees involved, the higher the chance to win a financial donation. This competition was also in celebration of the fifth anniversary of the Foundation.\n\nFor further details on the Foundation and its annual report, see vanlanschotkempen.com/en/vlkf.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEver since its inception in 1737, Van Lanschot Kempen has been committed to doing business with respect for the world around us and with an eye for future generations. We believe that wealth is more than money. Art and culture are part of the DNA of Van Lanschot Kempen. Supporting art, artists and museums is one way that we, as a wealth manager, can contribute to the preservation and creation of our cultural heritage. After all, art and culture show us the beauty and meaning of life.\n\nOur main sponsorship activities in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen is a partner of the Topsport Community. This three-year partnership connects the worlds of top sport, business, science and culture, and focuses on sharing knowledge.\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen is the main sponsor of Het Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. This five-year partnership fits with our focus on preserving and creating wealth in the broadest sense of the word.\n- -Van Lanschot Private Banking is the main partner of the Van Gogh Museum. This three-year partnership is the result of successful collaboration between the museum and our company since 2015.\n- -Through the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, we also became sponsor of the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum.\n\nThe second theme linked to social capital is 'SME development & decent work'. Here, the GIP focuses on sustainable SME development and the provision of decent jobs with fair employment practices. One example of how the GIP contributes to this theme is by investing in Sokowatch. Within the consumer goods market in Africa, due to a lack of infrastructure, small retailers are often dependent on inefficient stocking systems. Sokowatch tries to tackle this problem through a B2B e-commerce platform that connects merchants to local and multi-national suppliers, increasing profit margins for small family retailers in urban areas.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn 2021, we fine-tuned our policies and focused on validating and improving our impact assessment methodology. In the coming years, we will continue to focus on our living better for longer theme, aiming to create policies and targets, and to steer on those targets. In addition, we will focus on expanding our impact assessment - for example, by quantifying the social capital impact of our mortgages and other loans.",

This allows us to propose a dividend of\n\nThe increase in net result compared with 2020 is due to several factors. Firstly, thanks to growth in assets under management (AuM), commission income increased significantly by 30%. Secondly, book profits and valuation gains led to a substantially higher income. Thirdly, whereas we had to report a significant loss on our structured product activities in 2020, these activities performed only slightly negatively in 2021.\n\n- 1 Full-year 2021 and 2020 including retained earnings; half-year 2021 excluding retained earnings.\n- 3 Return on average Common Equity Tier 1 capital is calculated based on underlying (annualised) net result.\n\nClient assets grew to \u20ac131.1 billion (2020: \u20ac115.0 billion), while our AuM increased by 13% to \u20ac112.1 billion. This growth was driven by a positive market performance of \u20ac9.5 billion as well as by the AuM from our partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden (\u20ac3.8 billion per July 2021). AuM in our Private Clients segment showed an exceptionally high net inflow of \u20ac3.8 billion, which was outweighed by a net outflow in our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment of \u20ac4.0 billion. As the margin on inflows in our Private Clients segment is higher than the margin on outflows in our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, this combination led to a significant improvement in management fees.\n\n- 2 The comparative figures show the earnings per share for Van Lanschot Kempen NV prior to the legal merger with Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV.",

Securities commissions increased by 33% due to higher income from management fees, reflecting the fierce growth in assets under management in our Private Clients segment. Other commissions increased, mainly as a result of Corporate Finance and Equity Capital Markets (ECM) deals in our Investment Banking Clients segment.\n\nAnnualised recurring securities commission (run rate) was at a significantly higher level compared with year-end 2020, because of the strong growth in AuM. Annualised recurring fees are determined by multiplying the AuM on the reporting date by the management fee per client to determine the expected annualised management fee, assuming the AuM remains unchanged. The expected annual transaction fees relating to these client portfolios are then added to this number.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The result of Corporate Finance and ECM deals was \u20ac42.3 million (17% higher than in 2020) on the back of multiple deals, driven by outperformance within ECM in particular.\n\n## Interest\n\n| Interest (\u20ac million)                             |   2021 |   2020 |       |   H2 2021 |   H1 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross interest margin                            |  172.7 |  169.9 | 2 %   |      89.7 |      83   |\n| Interest income and charges on hedge derivatives |  -15.1 |   -5.4 |       |      -9.5 |      -5.6 |\n| Interest equalisation                            |  -16.2 |  -19.7 |       |      -7.9 |      -8.4 |\n| Clean interest margin                            |  141.3 |  144.8 | -2 %  |      72.3 |      69   |\n| Miscellaneous interest income and charges        |    9.4 |    4   |       |       4   |       5.4 |\n| Loan commission                                  |    2.9 |    3.3 | -11 % |       1.3 |       1.6 |\n| Interest                                         |  153.6 |  152.1 | 1 %   |      77.6 |      76.1 |\n\nThe current interest rate climate continues to put pressure on our interest income, but we managed to stabilise total interest income. Our 2021 interest income of \u20ac153.6 million was up 1% on the \u20ac152.1 million realised in 2020. The decrease in interest margin is partly offset by growth in our total loan portfolio of \u20ac0.4 billion to \u20ac8.9 billion.\n\nOn average, we charged negative interest rates on \u20ac3.3 billion of savings in 2021 (H1: \u20ac2.5 billion; H2: \u20ac4.1 billion) compared with \u20ac0.9 billion of savings in 2020. The impact of charging negative interest rates increased from \u20ac4.6 million in 2020 to \u20ac16.6 million in 2021. This is the result of lowering the threshold for negative interest rates on savings to \u20ac250,000 per account as of 1 January 2021. Starting on 1 July 2021, the threshold was further lowered to \u20ac100,000 per account. We also introduced a wealth management arrangement to our private clients: this meets their need to retain a proportion of their wealth in savings without paying negative interest.\n\nIn comparison with year-end 2020, the interest margin fell by 5 basis points to an average of 98 basis points. The 'clean interest margin' declined by 6 basis points compared with its level at the end of 2020, to 92 basis points at the end of 2021.\n\nMiscellaneous interest income and charges went up from \u20ac4.0 million to \u20ac9.4 million because we needed to record \u20ac5.1 million in 2020 to compensate mortgage clients.\n\n## Income from securities and associates\n\n| Income from securities and associates (\u20ac million)   |   2021 |   2020 |      |   H2 2021 |   H1 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------|-----------|-----------|\n| Dividend                                            |   10.9 |    8.3 | 31 % |       6.8 |       4   |\n| Realised capital gains                              |   19   |    0.6 |      |      18.8 |       0.2 |\n| Valuation gains and losses                          |   36.1 |    8.8 |      |      18   |      18.1 |\n| Income from securities and associates               |   65.9 |   17.7 |      |      43.6 |      22.3 |\n\n| Income from, and book value of, securities and  associates (\u20ac million)   |   Income  2021 |   Income  2020 |   Book value  year-end 2021 |   Book value  year-end 2020 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Van Lanschot Participaties (minority interests)                          |           36.5 |           14.2 |                        52.2 |                        47.4 |\n| Bolster Investment Co\u00f6peratief UA                                        |            3.9 |            4.1 |                        51.3 |                        37   |\n| Co-investments in own products                                           |           23   |           -0.9 |                       202.3 |                       146.3 |\n| Other equity investments                                                 |            2.6 |            0.3 |                         1.7 |                         1.7 |\n| Total from securities and associates                                     |           65.9 |           17.7 |                       307.5 |                       232.4 |\n\nIncome from securities and associates relates to investments of our equity investment company Van Lanschot Participaties and our investment in Bolster Investments\n\nCo\u00f6peratief UA.

        "page_content": "Realised capital gains were up to \u20ac19.0 million in 2021, mainly as a result of the sale of our stakes in Fire Safety Holding BV (Gerco) (over \u20ac10 million) and Quint Wellington Redwood Holding BV (around \u20ac5 million). In addition, we sold 100% of the shares in Global Property Research BV (GPR). This transaction resulted in a book profit of \u20ac2.7 million and fits into our strategy to focus on wealth management.\n\nValuation gains and losses rose by almost \u20ac30 million to \u20ac36.1 million in 2021. This was made up of positive results\n\nin our private equity portfolio, mainly due to a revaluation of almost \u20ac10 million of one of our fund investments, following a capital round for one of their portfolio companies, and the higher result of our own investment funds compared with 2020.\n\nThe total result of our own investment funds, excluding dividends, is \u20ac12.2 million - consisting of \u20ac22.0 million on our own funds and -\u20ac9.8 million on hedges. The hedges are reported under Result on financial transactions.\n\n## Result on financial transactions\n\n| Result on financial transactions (\u20ac million)   |   2021 |   2020 |       |   H2 2021 |   H1 2021 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Result on securities trading                   |    1.7 |    2.1 | -21 % |       0.5 |       1.2 |\n| Result on currency trading                     |    8.7 |    8.2 | 6 %   |       4.3 |       4.4 |\n| Result on investment portfolio                 |    3   |    0.4 |       |       2.7 |       0.3 |\n| Result on hedges                               |  -20.7 |  -38.7 |       |      -9.2 |     -11.4 |\n| Other income                                   |   -3   |   -4.3 |       |      -3.8 |       0.8 |\n| Result on financial transactions               |  -10.3 |  -32.3 |       |      -5.5 |      -4.8 |\n\nResult on financial transactions improved by \u20ac22.0 million, mainly driven by an improved result on hedges. Firstly, the result on hedges entails a \u20ac9.8 million negative result on futures that are used to mitigate risk relating to our investments in our own investment funds. Secondly, a \u20ac6.8 million negative hedging result applies to the Kempen Dutch Inflation Fund. This is almost entirely offset by interest income. Lastly, results relating to structured products activities decreased significantly to -\u20ac4.6 million (2020: -\u20ac35.1 million). This result is the combined effect of trading activities, secondary market sales and the winddown of our macro-hedging portfolio. The negative result on structured products activities is largely offset by\n\n\u20ac3.3 million in sales commission reported under Securities commissions.\n\nIn response to the loss in 2020, we tightened our risk appetite, and new positions are hedged almost exclusively back-to-back (see \"Risk and capital management\" on page 62 for more details). As a result of these developments, our current macro-hedging portfolio is down to \u20ac385 million (2020: \u20ac691 million).\n\nResult on securities trading of \u20ac1.7 million reflects our trading book's positive performance. Trading activities are the result of client facilitation only, mainly providing liquidity to clients.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n273.0\n\n119.7\n\n13.9\n\n17.3\n\n409.9\n\n| Operating expenses (\u20ac million)           | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Staff costs                              |        |\n| Other administrative expenses            |        |\n| - of which regulatory levies and charges |        |\n| Depreciation and amortisation            |        |\n| Operating expenses                       |        |\n\n|   2020 |     |   H2 2021 |   H1 2021 |\n|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|\n|  239.3 | 14% |     143.6 |     129.3 |\n|  115.3 | 4%  |      60.3 |      59.4 |\n|   11.1 | 25% |       4   |       9.9 |\n|   17.2 | 0%  |       9.2 |       8.1 |\n|  371.8 | 10% |     213.1 |     196.8 |\n\nOperating expenses increased by \u20ac38.1 million. In 2020, operating expenses were lower due to cost-saving measures - partly structural and partly one-off - as a response to the anticipated financial impact of Covid-19. Main drivers in 2021 included the partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden and the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers (around \u20ac16 million) as well as an increase in staff costs due to higher variable remuneration as a result of significantly better financial performance.\n\n## Staff costs\n\nStaff costs increased by \u20ac33.7 million (14%) in 2021. Firstly, the partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden and the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers led to an increase in staff costs of \u20ac10.3 million. Secondly, significantly better group financial performance led to \u20ac8.6 million higher variable remuneration and a one-off end-of-year payment (of \u20ac3,000 per employee) to all employees in the\n\nNetherlands (with a total impact of \u20ac4.4 million). Thirdly, our staff grew by 90 FTEs to 1,654 FTEs (2020: 1,564 FTEs), primarily in the teams that contribute to our digital capabilities, compliance function and the development of investment solutions. The acquisition of the 70% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden also led to 35 additional FTEs.\n\n## Other administrative expenses\n\nOther administrative expenses were relatively stable, excluding regulatory costs that increased by \u20ac2.7 million.\n\n## Efficiency ratio\n\nThe efficiency ratio - i.e. the ratio of operating expenses (excluding costs incurred for special items) to income from operating activities - significantly improved to 68.9% (2020: 85.7%). This improvement was driven by the increase in income from operating activities, which more than offset the increase in operating expenses.",

We saw limited impact on our loan portfolio and impairments from Covid-19.\n\nIn 2020, IFRS 9 models were deemed too optimistic for certain clients and industries, given the uncertainty related to Covid-19. We therefore applied a management overlay of \u20ac4.9 million. This was the result of extensive client monitoring and sector analysis, leading to adjustments in the stage classification of some clients. In 2021, the \u20ac11.7 million net release from loan loss provisions included a release of \u20ac3.3 million out of the \u20ac4.9 million management overlay, meaning that the current management overlay amounts to \u20ac1.6 million.\n\nIn 2021, the release from loan loss provisions relative to average risk-weighted assets worked out at a release of 29 basis points (2020: addition of 4 basis points). Other impairments are reversed impairments on participating interests, taken in earlier years.\n\n## Non-strategic investments\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we sold our stake in Holonite (Hollowell BV), a non-strategic investment. The sale of Holonite contributed \u20ac3.1 million in operating profit before tax of non-strategic investments. Due to tax treatment, the contribution to the net result was \u20ac2.2 million.\n\nFollowing the sale of our stake in Holonite, our only remaining non-strategic investment is in Allshare. The total operating profit (before tax), including book profit, from our portfolio of non-strategic investments amounted to \u20ac4.8 million in 2021, up from \u20ac1.7 million in 2020.\n\n## Special items\n\n| Special items (\u20ac million)                                        |   2021 | 2020   |     |   H2 2021 | H1 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|\n| Amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions      |   11.3 | 6.2    | 82% |       7.6 | 3.7       |\n| Expenses related to accounting treatment of Mercier Vanderlinden |    8.5 | -      |     |       8.5 | -         |\n| Provision for revolving consumer credit                          |    3.3 | -      |     |       3.3 | -         |\n| Restructuring charges                                            |    3.9 | 1.6    |     |       2.6 | 1.2       |\n| Other one-off items                                              |    2.3 | -      |     |       2.3 | -         |\n| Special items                                                    |   29.3 | 7.8    |     |      24.3 | 5.0       |\n\nWe recognised several special items in 2021, totalling \u20ac29.3 million (2020: \u20ac7.8 million).\n\nDue to the partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden and the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, the amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions increased from \u20ac6.2 million in 2020 to \u20ac11.3 million in 2021. In July 2021, we completed the acquisition of 70% of the shares in Mercier Vanderlinden. We agreed to acquire the remaining 30% of the shares at the beginning of 2025 and beginning of 2026. In addition, earn-out agreements were made.\n\nBased on the agreed transaction structure, IFRS requires the full consolidation of Mercier Vanderlinden at the time of the initial closing. As a consequence, certain elements from the transaction will need to be treated as profit and loss items until 2026. In our 2021 results, the following costs are included:\n\n- -Expenses related to the accounting treatment of Mercier Vanderlinden: interest costs (for the accrued time value of money) and staff costs relating to the liability, totalling \u20ac5.5 million (as we agreed on a discount if one of the partners were to leave prior to 2025 or 2026, as agreed);\n- -Expenses related to accounting treatment of Mercier Vanderlinden: given the good progress made in 2021 in terms of AuM and profitability, the estimated cost for the final purchase in 2025/2026 has increased by \u20ac3.0 million;\n- -Other one-off items: as the 2021 results of Mercier Vanderlinden were better than forecast, a specific oneoff earn-out was revalued from nil at closing to \u20ac3.5 million at year-end.\n\nWe have made a provision of \u20ac3.3 million under a compensation scheme for the repayment of excess interest to (former) clients with variable-rate revolving consumer credits.\n\n## Income tax\n\nIncome tax for 2021 amounted to \u20ac34.6 million (2020: \u20ac4.4 million), which translates to an effective tax rate of 19.4% compared with 8.1% in 2020. Our effective tax rate is lower than the general Dutch tax rate of 25%, due to income from our private equity portfolio being covered by equity exemption rules.",

Total AuM also includes the positions of our private clients invested in our investment strategies (\u20ac4.3 billion).\n\nIn Belgium, we have been achieving good net inflow year on year. In 2021, the net inflow picked up further, leading to a net inflow of \u20ac0.8 billion. Coupled with the partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden and positive market performance, total AuM grew to \u20ac9.7 billion.

These mortgages are primarily granted to high net-worth individuals.\n\n## Wholesale & Institutional Clients\n\nAuM in the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment was fairly stable at \u20ac67.6 billion (2020: \u20ac67.8 billion), with positive market performance of \u20ac3.8 billion and net outflow of \u20ac4.0 billion.\n\nFiduciary mandates showed an outflow of \u20ac1.4 billion, primarily caused by the loss of two institutional mandates, both because of mergers (with an impact of \u20ac3.4 billion). This was partly offset by the addition of a new \u20ac1.1 billion mandate, while our UK fiduciary activities showed a net inflow of \u20ac1.1 billion.\n\nInvestment strategies saw a net outflow of \u20ac2.6 billion. This was mainly caused by outflow in our credit strategies and the loss of a government bond mandate. This was partly offset by our small-cap strategies driven by the inflow of two global small-cap mandates and both inflow and market performance of the Kempen Global Small-cap Fund.\n\nAuM Wholesale & Institutional Clients (\u20ac billion)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio (based on foreclosure value) is 62%. Our methodology for determining the LTV on residential mortgages changed in 2021. The calculation is now based on the indexed foreclosure value; previously, it was based on the lower value out of the amount of the mortgage registration or the indexed foreclosure value. The adjusted methodology is in line with the generally accepted norms for LTV determination.\n\n## Other loans\n\nOther loans comprise loans to high net-worth individuals as well as commercial loans that fit into our Private Clients relationship model. In 2021, other loans grew to \u20ac2.2 billion (year-end 2020: \u20ac2.0 billion). The growth was predominantly in Lombard loans in Belgium and Switzerland.\n\nStarting in 2021, we began reporting our corporate banking loan portfolio in this category as well. The winding down of this portfolio continued in 2021 and it now amounts to \u20ac132 million (2020: \u20ac195 million).\n\n## Mortgages distributed by third parties\n\nThe portfolio of mortgages distributed by third parties consists of regular Dutch mortgages. It is intended to supplement our investment portfolio and enable us to generate attractive returns on available liquidity. It accounts for 4% of our total loan portfolio, with a volume of \u20ac0.4 million (2020: \u20ac0.5 million). The decrease is due to repayments and a competitive pricing environment.\n\n## Impaired loans and provisions\n\nWe take provisions for the impaired loans in our loan book. Impaired loans totalled \u20ac153 million at the end of 2021, and decreased by 18% compared with 2020 (\u20ac186 million).\n\nThe Stage 3 provisions for these loans amounted to \u20ac42 million, working out at a coverage ratio of 28% (the same as in 2020). The total impaired ratio improved from 2.2% to 1.7% at the end of 2021, as impairments decreased faster than the total loan portfolio.\n\n| Provision as at 31/12/2021 (\u20ac million)   | Loan portfolio   | Impaired loans   | Provision   | Impaired  ratio  31/12/2021   | Coverage  ratio  31/12/2021   | Impaired  ratio  31/12/2020   | Coverage  ratio  31/12/2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Mortgages                                | 6,337            | 30               | 2           | 0.5%                          | 5%                            | 0.8%                          | 6%                            |\n| Other loans                              | 2,199            | 121              | 41          | 5.5%                          | 34%                           | 6.7%                          | 36%                           |\n| Loan portfolio                           | 8,536            | 152              | 42          | 1.8%                          | 28%                           | 2.3%                          | 28%                           |\n| Mortgages distributed by third parties   | 389              | 1                | 0           | 0.2%                          | 0%                            | 0.2%                          | 2%                            |\n| Total loan portfolio                     | 8,925            | 153              | 42          | 1.7%                          | 28%                           | 2.2%                          | 28%                           |\n| Provision                                | -49              |                  |             |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| Total                                    | 8,876            |                  | 42          |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| ECL Stage 1 and 2 (IFRS 9)               |                  |                  | 7           |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| Total ECL (IFRS 9)                       |                  |                  | 49          |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n\n## Capital management\n\n| Capital and liquidity management (\u20ac million)   | 31/12/2021   | 31/12/2020   | 30/06/2021   | 30/06/2021   | 30/06/2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Total risk exposure amount                     | 3,927        | 4,195        | -6%          | 4,586        | -14%         |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (%) 5               | 23.7         | 24.3         |              | 21.9         |              |\n| Tier 1 ratio (%) 5                             | 26.3         | 25.4         |              | 23.1         |              |\n| Total capital ratio (%) 5                      | 30.1         | 27.4         |              | 25.2         |              |\n| Leverage ratio (%)                             | 6.3          | 7.1          |              | 7.2          |              |\n\nOur CET 1 ratio decreased slightly in 2021, to 23.7%.

        "page_content": "## RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n## Key risk themes for Van Lanschot Kempen\n\n## Interest rate risk: low interest rate environment\n\nThe low interest rate environment persisted in 2021. At the same time, during the uncertainties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, monetary authorities stuck with their accommodating monetary policy stance. This has been mainly through asset purchase programmes, further expanding their balance sheets, and more forward guidance on policy rates to signal that interest rates will remain low for a longer period. This is despite the rise in inflation.\n\n## Operational risk: Covid-19\n\nThe global Covid-19 pandemic impacted us in many different ways: most notably in terms of lockdowns in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Switzerland.\n\nSignificant government and central bank intervention coupled with increasing vaccination rates resulted in a partial reopening of society, which caused a sharp rebound in economic activities. Furthermore, equity and commodity markets showed a strong increase, while other financial markets were relatively calm.\n\n## Operational risk: implementing change\n\nIn this rapidly changing world, organisations only survive if they continuously adapt to new circumstances. However, changes in products, processes and the organisation in most cases lead to temporarily increasing operational risks.\n\n## Information risk: cybercrime and IT security\n\nOur IT systems are the backbone of our organisation. Managing the security and availability of these systems is therefore crucial for us.\n\n## Compliance risk: increasing requirements\n\nCompliance risk remained a focal point for Van Lanschot Kempen in 2021, both from an internal and an external perspective. One example is the EU's new Sustainable Action Plan, implemented through regulatory provisions such as the Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). In addition, the regulatory focus on the prevention of financial crime remains high.\n\n## Actions\n\nWe expanded the range of client savings that are subject to negative interest rates to balances over \u20ac100,000. This is in combination with our wealth management arrangement through which we offer our clients with significant AuM with us the possibility to keep a certain amount of their assets invested with us in cash, without being charged a negative interest rate. Our aim is to find the right balance between the need for transaction cash for clients with significant AuM and mitigating our own interest rate risk. As a result of lowering the threshold, the risk of prolonged negative impact caused by low interest rates has decreased.\n\n## Actions\n\nIn 2021, we continued our crisis management governance, with a Crisis Management team and a Crisis Support team making decisions based on the continually changing Covid-19 situation. The focus moved from mitigating short-term operational risks to long-term initiatives to keep staff healthy, maintain social cohesion and deal with the social effects of the prolonged lockdown. In the second half of the reporting year, we shifted from crisis management to developing and implementing our way of working, whereby hybrid working became embedded in the organisation.\n\nWe continue to monitor our loan book closely, while government support is still blurring credit risks to a certain extent. However, the fact that our main lending activities are in mortgages to private individuals, combined with the positive general economic trend in the Netherlands, means that credit risks have declined compared with the beginning of 2021.\n\n## Actions\n\nIn 2021, we developed new methodologies for project risk management, risk management in an Agile/DevOps environment and value chain assessments. Most of the focus was on the implementation of the new frameworks in major projects such as the integration of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers and our partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden.\n\n## Actions\n\nIn 2021, we continued to improve the security and availability of our IT systems using a structured approach, managed by the security upgrade programme, known as Security 5.0. Many changes, large and small, have been implemented to increase our resilience against unwanted downtime and/or security threats.\n\n## Actions\n\nWe are proactively responding to external regulatory developments through dedicated implementation working groups in which our Compliance department takes part, as well as through other control functions within the company. Special efforts have been made to implement various sustainability-related regulations, and we have been working extensively to adapt policies, procedures and controls to the new regulatory requirements as well as to the demands and expectations of clients and investors.\n\nIn addition, we have devoted, and continue to devote, substantial resources to strengthening our compliance framework and team. In this context, the Management Board has completed a group-wide project to enhance our anti-financial crime framework and its policies, procedures and controls. We have implemented the enhancements identified by this overarching project.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability risk: climate change\n\n1. Physical risks: These refer to the financial impact of a changing climate, including more frequent and/or severe extreme weather events and gradual changes in climate, as well as environmental degradation, such as air, water and land pollution.\n\nWe have identified two types of climate change risk:\n\n2. Transition risks: These result from the process of adjustment towards a carbon-neutral economy. These adjustments are driven by changes in climate-related policies, new low-carbon technologies and/or shifting market sentiment.\n\nGiven the floods in the Netherlands' southernmost province of Limburg in summer 2021 (physical risks), and consequent exclusion by some large asset managers of certain firms causing a potential reaction in market prices (transition risks), the risk of climate change is relevant today and will become even more important in the future.\n\n## Risk management\n\n## Risk profile and risk appetite\n\nWe seek to achieve a solid risk profile - expressed in transparent risk levels coupled with a robust liquidity and capital position. The risks we face are outlined in the following sections. More detailed descriptions can be found in the financial statements, where these risks are also quantified, wherever possible, in terms of their impact on Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nWe evaluate our risk appetite annually, and this is then communicated in a risk appetite statement containing both qualitative and quantitative elements. Our risk appetite represents our willingness to accept the risk of particular losses, decreasing buffers and reputational risks, and as such sets our operating boundaries. The statement is prepared by the Management Board and is subject to the Supervisory Board's approval.\n\nTargets and risk limits are more dynamic and may occasionally be reviewed, at least annually. That said, we do not change the key principles that underlie our risk appetite and that create the framework within which we operate:\n\n- -We only take risks that - directly or indirectly - serve our strategic objectives;\n- -We only take risks that we understand and can explain;\n- -The sum of all risks taken should not exceed our riskbearing capacity;\n- -We do not take any risks that could materially harm our reputation;\n- -When taking risks, we take the requirements and expectations of all stakeholders into account;\n- -Our risk appetite should be considered in all business decisions at every level of the organisation;\n- -We avoid risks that could lead to legal or regulatory breaches.\n\nA risk dashboard and progress report is discussed by the company's Risk Committee every quarter, as well as periodically by the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. Risk-taking is in the nature of wealth managers; low risks are not a means to an end. For a number of reasons, it may be appropriate to accept a higher risk - either temporarily or for a prolonged period. We always consider both gross and net - i.e. after mitigating measures - risk positions, paying extra attention to high risks.\n\n## Actions\n\nWe made further enhancements to our stress testing capabilities for both physical and transition risks. While stress testing depends on almost unlimited adverse scenarios, we intend to adopt scenarios used by well-established authorities as a starting point. For example, we used the DNB transition risk stress tests for equity holdings to screen all sustainability risks in our own funds and funds under management, and we provided portfolio managers with an ESG dashboard. For physical risks, we used flooding data provided by national authorities and the Dutch meteorological institute's weather forecasts.\n\nThe risk appetite and the risk that materialised in 2021 for each individual risk type are shown in this simplified version of the risk dashboard below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk  dashboard     | Low   | Limited   | Medium   | High   |\n|---------------------|-------|-----------|----------|--------|\n| Strategic risk      |       | \ue113         | \u2610        |        |\n| Credit risk         | \ue113     | \u2610         |          |        |\n| Market risk         |       | \ue113\u2610        |          |        |\n| Liquidity risk      | \ue113\u2610    |           |          |        |\n| Interest rate risk  |       | \ue113\u2610        |          |        |\n| Operational risk    |       | \ue113         | \u2610        |        |\n| Information risk    |       | \ue113         | \u2610        |        |\n| Compliance risk     |       | \u2610         | \ue113        |        |\n| Sustainability risk |       | \ue113\u2610        |          |        |\n\n\u2610 Risk appetite\n\n\ue113\n\nRisk in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClients entrust their funds to us, which is only possible when they have no doubt about the financial and operational stability of the organisation. We can therefore only operate at limited risk levels. However, certain risks are unavoidable and can only be mitigated to a certain extent. Those three risk appetites are classified in the dashboard as medium: strategic risk, operational risk and information risk. Strategic risk appetite is medium while competition in both the private banking and investment management markets is fierce. These risks can only be managed by actively optimising our results and growing through M&A opportunities. Given our increasing volume of AuM, the complex nature of the business and the continuing innovation of our investment management offering, we need to have a medium level of operational risk appetite. Of course, we strive to continuously reduce operational risks by improving the functioning of the organisation. Lastly, information risk appetite is medium, while all financial services providers and the majority of companies are exposed to information risk threats. Here, too, we take significant efforts to mitigate these risks, but they cannot be further reduced without having a major impact on daily operations.\n\nOur strategic risks can be managed by generating organic and inorganic growth to create enough scale for the future and to maintain solid performance. As a result of two acquisitions, strong organic growth in AuM and very strong financial results, the strategic risk that materialised in 2021 was limited. All financial risk indicators also scored well.",

        "page_content": "With an abundance of liquidity - mainly due to high client deposits - liquidity risks in 2021 were low. A net release of provisions reflects our low credit risks. We operated without any significant operational or IT security incidents in the reporting year, hence those risk scores for 2021 were limited as well.\n\nCompliance risk appetite was limited, while the actual compliance risk level that we assessed in 2021 was medium. Regulatory requirements continue to be highly demanding and require continued, intense effort by the organisation. Lastly, our sustainability risks were limited in 2021. The stress tests we performed did not show significant impact on balance sheet levels and the majority of our investment funds are classified as Article 8 or 9 under the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure (SFDR).\n\nWe operate our risk management framework in accordance with the three lines of defence model. The management teams at individual departments and units (the first line) are responsible for managing their specific risks. The Risk Management department and Compliance department (the second line) support management by facilitating risk assessments, writing policies, providing relevant advice and assistance on applicable regulatory requirements and the design of controls and mitigating actions, providing reports, and challenging the first line on the management of their risks. The Internal Audit department (the third line) monitors whether the activities of the first and second lines are effectively mitigating the risks identified. Lastly, we use insurance to cover certain remaining risks.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is defined as the risk to Van Lanschot Kempen's performance resulting from failure to respond adequately to changes in external factors or from poor strategic decisions. External factors include the actions of competitors, clients, potential market entrants and public authorities, as well as public opinion. Keeping up with technological developments and fintech is also a key topic on our strategic agenda. Furthermore, a prolonged period of low interest rates puts pressure on our net interest income.\n\nOther important elements are the capacity to meet all specific regulatory and client demands, the consequences of operating in specific niche markets, and the risks associated with a relatively small-scale organisation. We use a range of performance indicators - such as growth in assets under management, net result, efficiency ratio and FTE trends together with a qualitative assessment to monitor and control strategic risk. Due to the challenging environment both economically and in terms of technological developments, our strategic risk appetite remains at a medium level going forward. The technological improvements we have made for our clients and to our internal processes over recent years show that we are continuously aware of, and acting to address, this challenge. Lastly, through our acquisitions in recent years, we are actively addressing the risk of consolidation in the sector, and are improving our economies of scale.\n\n## Financial risks\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is still one of our most significant financial risk types, but the risk profile is low. Our loan portfolio amounts to \u20ac8.9 billion and has manageable risks; 71% of the loan\n\nportfolio consists of the Private Clients segment's Dutch residential mortgage loans. We aim to keep the size of this portfolio at least constant (or with modest growth) by generating enough new business to offset repayments and prepayments. New mortgages are primarily provided to private clients who also hold assets under management with Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nCredit quality in general further improved in 2021. Covid-19 did not have an impact on this, because the majority of the loan book consists of mortgages, and most of our clients have significant financial buffers. In 2021, loan losses continued to reach historically low levels. In order to monitor and measure credit risks for most of our loan portfolios, we use sophisticated risk models (internal ratings-based (IRB) approach). Only our residential mortgages IRB model is used for regulatory reporting. As observed in 2020, we are seeing positive rating migration in nearly all portfolios as an additional indicator of improved credit quality. Our loan portfolio and credit risks are concentrated in the Netherlands (93%); lending in Belgium and Switzerland is limited, and mainly involves Lombard loans with low risk profiles.\n\nLoan portfolio, excluding provision (100% = \u20ac8.9. billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough our exposure to the Dutch housing market is fairly significant, the concentration risk on single line items in the overall loan portfolio is relatively limited. The ten largest loans to individual counterparties, other than financial institutions, totalled \u20ac244 million at year-end 2021, compared with \u20ac180 million at year-end 2020. 96.9% of the Dutch loan portfolio consists of loans of less than \u20ac10 million at year-end 2021 (year-end 2020: 97.5%). Our policy is to keep credit-risk limits on any single debtor at an acceptable level in order to contain concentration risk and to mitigate its potential impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's results (see page 134 in the financial statements for more information).\n\n## Mortgage loans\n\nAt year-end, 71% of our loan portfolio consisted of mortgages. Our portfolio differs from that of other Dutch mortgage lenders in that the average loan (approximately \u20ac542,000) is higher. This makes the portfolio a little more sensitive to a fall in underlying house prices, although the majority of our exposure is in urban areas - generally a more liquid segment of the housing market. Our methodology for determining the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) on residential mortgages changed in 2021. The calculation is now based on the indexed foreclosure value; previously, it was based on the lower value out of the amount of the mortgage registration or the indexed foreclosure value. The adjusted methodology is in line with the generally accepted norms for LTV determination. In 2021, house prices in the Netherlands",

New issuances are, in general, issued for LTVs between 50% and 90%.\n\nIn 2015, we started to provide mortgages through a network of intermediaries, branded as Hypotrust and with Quion as our service provider for our white-label mortgages. Since then, we have built up a white-label portfolio with good risk characteristics and with very few loan losses. Our whitelabel mortgages are subject to strict acceptance criteria, and the size of this portfolio amounted to \u20ac389 million by yearend 2021 (year-end 2020: \u20ac476 million). This portfolio has decreased and now makes up 4% of the total loan portfolio.\n\nIn 2020, we started our \"interest-only mortgage project', the aim of which is to enable clients to make conscious choices about their interest-only mortgages. For example, clients with potentially declining incomes (e.g. due to retirement) are actively assisted by us to limit the risk of not being able to pay off their loans at maturity date. To this end, we provide insights into the status of their mortgage and its future affordability and flexibility. All clients with interest-only mortgages (including investment-based mortgages) are plotted on a matrix based on guidelines from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The matrix is based on the LTV combined with the remaining financial term, term to retirement, or end of tax deductibility. All clients in the highest risk category (LTV above 100%) were approached personally in 2020, and results were recorded in our client relationship management system. In 2021, clients in the high and medium risk categories (LTV between 50% and 100%) were approached, as part of regular talks with our clients, and the results recorded. This project will continue in 2022 for clients in the low risk category (LTV below 50%). In this way, we increase awareness among clients and try to avoid potentially difficult situations.\n\nMortgage loans: new production by type (%)Mortgage loan-to-value (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMortgage loans: remaining gross business per year (\u20ac million) compared with house price trends\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the same category are commercial activities that fit into Private Clients' relationship model, such as funding investments for family businesses, business professionals and executives, healthcare professionals and entrepreneurs. These kinds of loans are supplementary to our wealth management strategy and typically involve the client bringing in AuM. Our aim is to keep the size of this portfolio stable.\n\nStarting in 2021, we began reporting our corporate banking loan portfolio in this category as well. The winding down of this portfolio continued in 2021 and it now amounts to \u20ac132 million (2020: \u20ac195 million).\n\nOther loans: type of loan (100% = \u20ac2.2 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Real estate loans\n\nOur real estate loans, both those provided to private clients and corporate banking's legacy portfolio, amount to \u20ac381 million (2020: \u20ac331 million). These loans are provided primarily on the basis of a total quality assessment of the borrowers. We also take into account the quality and sustainability of the property, and the diversification and stability of the rental flows. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) is calculated so that we can determine the extent to which a client will be able to make interest and principal payments from the rental income generated by their\n\ncommercial real estate. At year-end 2021, 88% of our real estate loans generated sufficient rental income to cover interest and principal payments, i.e. had a DSCR of over 1 (year-end 2020: 86%). Clients with a DSCR of less than 1 often have other income-generating assets they can use to service their loan obligations. Lastly, the LTV of real estate loans also improved as a result of increasing real estate prices, despite the economic situation caused by the exceptional circumstances related to Covid-19.\n\n## Impaired loans\n\nImpaired loans are defaulted loans in IFRS 9 credit quality Stage 3. The impact of Covid-19 on our portfolio was closely monitored throughout the year. At year-end, the impact on our portfolios was once again limited. This is mostly due to the composition of the portfolio (mainly mortgages and very limited corporate exposure), coupled with our core clients having significant financial buffers.\n\nImpaired loans accounted for 1.7% of the loan portfolio at the end of 2021 (year-end 2020: 2.2%). In 2021, a provision equal to 28% of impaired loans was taken (2020: 28%), resulting in specific provisions totalling \u20ac42.4 million.\n\n## Loan loss provision\n\nIn 2021, we released \u20ac12.0 million in provisions (in 2020, we added \u20ac1.7 million). During 2021, we saw an increase in exposures in Stage 1 and a decrease in exposures in Stage 3. Because government interventions to support companies affected by Covid-19 were distorting the true risks in the portfolio, in 2020 we applied a so-called management overlay of \u20ac4.9 million. This was the result of extensive client monitoring and sector analysis, leading to adjustments in the stage classification of some clients. In 2021, the \u20ac12.0 million net release from loan loss provisions included a release of \u20ac3.3 million out of the \u20ac4.9 million management overlay, meaning that the current management overlay amounts to \u20ac1.6 million.\n\nFor more information about credit risk, please refer to the discussion of risk management in the financial statements, Section 3, 'Credit risk'.",

        "page_content": "## Market risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is exposed to market risk through client-facilitating transactions. Our Treasury department performs structured product transactions for clients, while our Investment Banking Clients team performs equity transactions for clients and provides market liquidity, which may result in trading positions. The same applies to Private Clients regarding transactions in interest-related and foreign currency products. Temporary positions may arise from our efforts to facilitate our clients' requests. We invest in our own funds in order to align our interests with those of our clients and to support our investment management activities. We supported some newly launched Kempen funds (Kempen European Private Equity Funds I and II, European Direct Lending Pool) and divested some funds that reached maturity. The Risk Management department monitors market risks on a daily basis.\n\nFinancial markets in 2021 were relatively benign, and most equity markets rose significantly. All three activities exposed to market risk showed stable returns (equity brokerage, structured products, and interest and foreign exchange products for Private Clients). As a result of extreme financial market volatility in 2020, we made significant losses on structured products activities. This resulted in the strategic decision to reduce the risks on this activity significantly by moving from a macro-hedging strategy to an almost exclusively back-to-back hedging strategy, thereby decreasing most of the market risks in the portfolio. The structured products activities are being managed according to plan, with complex products now being almost exclusively hedged back-to-back. Structured products activities' trading limits have been decreasing in conjunction with the run-off of the macro-hedged portfolio, thereby reducing the market risks in the portfolio even further.\n\nFor further information on market risk, see Section 3, 'Market risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nOur wealth management business model naturally comes with a large client deposits base. These entrusted funds grew from \u20ac10.1 billion to \u20ac11.7 billion in 2021 driven by high market liquidity, despite the fact that by year-end 2021 we were charging negative interest rates on about 40% of our total deposit base. Our December 2021 loan-to-deposit ratio amounted to 76% (2020: 83%), which reflects the fact that our client deposit base exceeds our client loan book volume.\n\nFunding mix (100% = \u20ac16.3 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBecause of this, our reliance on other funding sources is limited, and our liquidity risk profile is mostly driven by the potential occurrence of unanticipated deposit outflows. Although our deposit base has not resulted from a competitive pricing policy and has proven to be sticky over time, there is always a risk of unexpected outflows, particularly for balances not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme (DGS). We take a cautious approach to liquidity risk, and aim to hold solid liquidity buffers that would allow us to absorb severe unexpected liquidity stress situations. Outcomes of liquidity stress tests, which cover acute and persistent liquidity stress, are discussed by our Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) on a monthly basis. Due to our strong liquidity buffer, stress test outcomes and other liquidity indicators such as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) remained well within limits throughout the year. At year-end 2021, the LCR and NSFR stood at 172.0% and 163.0% respectively (2020: 177.4% and 161.8%).\n\nOur liquidity risk management practices are outlined in our internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP), which is assessed by our supervisory authority De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) every year. DNB considers our liquidity and funding risk management to be adequate for a company of the size and complexity of Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe main funding and liquidity planning objective remains to reduce the impact of excess liquidity on net interest income, while maintaining a solid liquidity cushion and sufficient funding diversification. Although our loan portfolio could be entirely funded by client deposits, we aim to keep sufficient diversification in our funding mix in terms of funding type and maturity by supplementing the savings and deposits base with secured debt instruments that are issued under the Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond (CPTCB) programme. Due to our structurally high liquidity buffer, we did not issue any new benchmark wholesale debt instruments in 2021, except for the \u20ac50 million issuance of a Tier 2 instrument because we redeemed another Tier 2 instrument of the same value.\n\nTotal outstanding volume under the CPTCB programme remained at \u20ac1.5 billion throughout 2021. We do not have any benchmark-size unsecured debt issuances placed with investors. One covered bond will be redeemed in 2022. We are currently setting up an additional covered bond programme with a soft bullet structure. Going forward, we expect to issue new covered bonds via this programme.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Investment portfolio\n\nOur investment portfolio totalled \u20ac6.3 billion at year-end 2021, up from \u20ac5.5 billion at year-end 2020. It is maintained primarily for liquidity purposes, and consists mainly of liquid, low-risk instruments. The composition of the portfolio was relatively stable in 2021. There are strict limits on instrument types, counterparties, countries, ratings and credit spread risk. Despite lower yields and spreads, we maintained a liquid, low-risk investment portfolio in line with our investment policy. Even at the peak of Covid-19 market turmoil, the impact on the portfolio's value was mild.\n\nIn addition to day-to-day portfolio management, we review our investment portfolio annually to ensure it meets our environmental, social and governance criteria. We have not encountered any material sustainability issues in our investment portfolio to date.\n\n## Investment portfolio and liquidity by counterparty (100% = \u20ac6.3 billion)\n\nInvestment portfolio and liquidity by credit rating (100% = \u20ac6.3 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information on our liquidity risk profile, see Section 9, 'Liquidity risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nIn 2021, interest rates remained very low. In line with the majority of Dutch banks, we expanded the range of client savings on which we charge negative interest rates. By yearend 2021, we charged negative interest rates on about 40% of our total deposit base.\n\nClient preference for long interest rate maturities for mortgages continued as a result of the flat and historically low yield curve, both for newly agreed mortgages and for interest rate resets.\n\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, clients held their balances in variable-rate accounts (current accounts, savings and securities accounts). Given that these products have\n\nsimilar features and offer equal interest rates in the current environment, we observe that clients are becoming more indifferent as to which product they keep their balances in. Appetite for term deposits remained negligible, due to the low interest rates on these products. As of December 2021, our term deposit base amounted to only \u20ac363 million.\n\nWe manage our exposure to changing market interest rates (interest rate risk in the banking book) using both a valuebased and an income-based approach. We address longterm interest rate risk mainly via the economic value approach, which examines how movements in interest rates impact the value of our assets and liabilities. Given the current asymmetrical character of our interest rate risk exposure (mostly driven by implicit or contractual rate floors in products), we have shifted our interest rate risk management focus to a more scenario-based approach. We apply scenarios to both net interest income and economic value changes, and have set risk appetite limits for these.\n\nFor net interest income at risk, we have set a limit of 15% net interest income loss in the first 12 months, relative to our baseline scenario. All stress scenarios remained within this limit throughout the reporting year.\n\nFrom a risk management perspective, the combination of mortgages with long interest rate maturities, funded to a large extent by a variable-rate deposit base, poses a challenge: there is less room to adjust client loan rates if future funding costs rise. This risk is inherent to the banking business model and more prevalent in the current interest rate environment.\n\nFor more information on interest rate risk, see Section 8, 'Interest rate risk', in the risk management section of the financial statements.\n\n## Non-financial risks\n\nNon-financial risks comprise operational, information, compliance and sustainability risks.\n\nWe have defined a non-financial risk appetite. On a quarterly basis, the current non-financial risk exposure related to the non-financial risk appetite is discussed with senior management in the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee. In 2021, we further strengthened our nonfinancial risk management by implementing risk management frameworks for change processes. We also continued to use value-chain assessments to improve knowledge and documentation on processes and to reassess the key controls per value chain. In addition, we harmonised the approach to non-financial risks that is taken by the Risk Management and Compliance departments, resulting in an improved and harmonised risk management framework. The second line of defence continues to interact closely with the businesses, aiming to encourage an increasingly risk-based approach in managing non-financial risks. Influencing human behaviour and our risk culture is a structural way of further mitigating operational risk.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risks are potential losses that result from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, inadequate or incorrect human actions, external events and fraud. To identify and manage non-financial risks, we have created a group-wide risk management framework. Part of this framework is a set of key business controls on the part",

        "page_content": "of our value chains where residual risks are deemed to be elevated. Controls are regularly tested, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of key controls in our processes and systems. Other instruments we use for measuring and monitoring non-financial risks include incident registration, root cause analyses, risk self-assessments at both department level and value-chain level, and key risk indicators.\n\nSince 1 January 2021, the risk management function of Kempen Capital Management has been successfully integrated with the group Risk Management department. Through this integration, the Risk Management department has better oversight and can apply a uniform risk management approach and procedures across all wealth management activities. The risk management framework combines all relevant regulatory requirements of the bank with requirements for an asset manager (IFR, AIFMD, UCITS). This framework identifies, measures, manages and monitors all relevant risks to which our AuM are exposed. Quantitative and qualitative risk limits are set where possible, and are described in the various risk policies. While we manage the risks in the AuM of our clients, these activities are reported as operational risks.\n\nAll client portfolios are monitored against regulatory guidelines, investment guidelines (e.g. fund prospectuses and investment management agreements, which put limits on credit, counterparty credit and liquidity risks) and our internal policies on a daily basis. There were no material findings from the investment compliance programme.\n\nFinancial markets in general performed well over the reporting year, resulting in strong performances by our investment funds, and the majority of our strategies outperforming the benchmarks. Even though volatility stayed relatively low throughout the year, there were some spikes in implied volatility. Our investment funds proved resilient. Bidask spreads came down from their high levels since mid-2020, and liquidity in the funds improved. Overall, our investment funds remained well within market, liquidity and counterparty risk limits throughout the year. Lastly, the risk profile of investment funds remained stable across all funds.\n\n## Information risk\n\nPreventing cybercrime remains one of our key focus areas. We are aware of the risks concerning information security and cybercrime, and we have further invested in technological and process-related measures to mitigate them. In addition to awareness programmes and staff training, we continue to develop intelligent solutions and to work closely with industry partners. We use intelligent systems to analyse the transactions in our systems and search for fraudulent activities. As part of a multi-year programme, we have stepped up security measures to keep pace with increasing cyberthreats. Dedicated teams monitor security events, including threats posted on the dark web. We have teams that simulate cyberattacks and conduct physical penetration testing for training purposes. To monitor the risks involved in cybercrime, we have developed an integrated risk dashboard. The metrics in the dashboard are overseen by the interdepartmental Information Security Board. Issues related to cybercrime are reported directly to the Management Board.\n\nFor the continuation of operational processes during potential disruptions, threats and incidents, we have business continuity measures in place. These include a policy, a governance structure with a Business Continuity Committee and Crisis Management team, and working instructions. Moreover, multiple tests are performed during the year to assess whether these measures work in practice.\n\n## Internal fraud\n\nInternal fraud occurs when fraud is committed as an intentional action by one or more employees in which deception or management override of controls is used with the intent of gaining unlawful advantage for oneself or a relation at the expense of others. Employees also include management, temporary workers, contractors and trainees. Internal fraud is in conflict with our Code of Conduct.\n\nMaintaining our reputation as a trustworthy financial institution is of great importance to Van Lanschot Kempen, Assessing and mitigating fraud risks is therefore an important priority, because such risks can lead to financial damage to our clients and to our business. In addition, fraud can damage the public's trust in Van Lanschot Kempen's integrity as a financial institution. Our basic principles are set out in our Code of Conduct, and the guidelines and process for reporting and handling incidents are set out in our policy for handling integrity incidents.\n\nIncidents such as internal fraud cases are dealt with in accordance with the incident management procedure, which requires a root cause analysis to be performed on the incident, reporting on the incident and, where required, action to implement mitigating measures to prevent the incident from happening again. In 2021, no internal fraud was identified nor any attempt to commit fraud. No investigation of any person regarding internal fraud therefore needed to be conducted.\n\nAssessing and mitigating internal fraud risk is an integral part of our risk & control framework. Fraud risk is assessed through risk control self-assessments on processes and through the Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA). Key controls have been implemented to mitigate internal fraud risk. These key controls are captured in the risk & control framework and are periodically reviewed by the first line of defence and monitored independently by the second line of defence.\n\nSeveral initiatives have been (and are being) taken to mitigate internal fraud risk. Actions and priorities for continuous staff awareness and improvement are identified in the business-as-usual cycle. Staff training, starting with the on-boarding of new employees as well as periodic updates, are part of fraud mitigation measures.\n\nOur internal fraud risk assessment was included in our annual SIRA during 2021. This included various scenarios, such as the risk of staff stealing financial assets, physical assets or client data. The risk of staff executing unauthorised payment or credit transactions (as a result of insufficient segregation of duties or collusion) is also part of the risk assessment. The inherent risk of fraud in our overall risk assessment was evaluated as high: internal fraud can lead to substantial financial and reputational damage. But this fraud risk is mitigated by several measures, some of the most important of which being key controls. Some of our",

        "page_content": "operational risk controls (four-eye principle, access authentications, etc.) also work to mitigate against fraud. Furthermore, there is a set of specific controls to mitigate fraud risk, such as authorisation checks, system-enforced checks on manual payments and automated segregation of duties for payment systems. All these controls are periodically tested, evaluated by the Internal Control department and further monitored by the second and third lines of defence: the Compliance, Non-Financial Risk Management and Internal Audit departments.\n\nBased on effective testing, the residual risk of internal fraud was assessed as limited, which is within our risk appetite. The evidence of limited risk is based on the effectiveness of the controls combined with the absence of any major incidents: no major incidents have been reported in the last five years.\n\nFor more information about operational risk, please refer to the discussion of risk management in the financial statements, Section 5, 'Operational risk'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance responsibilities\n\nAs a company, we maintain an independent and effective compliance function to identify, assess, monitor and report on compliance risks. This entails the risk of failure by Van Lanschot Kempen to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and industry standards relevant for our business. In managing compliance risk, we use the three lines of defence model. This means that employees working in the various client segments (first line of defence) are responsible for serving clients, but also for assessing client-related risks, adhering to policy requirements and assuring control effectiveness.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nWhen operating in financial markets, it is important that we conduct our business activities in accordance with the expectations of our clients, shareholders, employees and relevant authorities, but also that we follow high ethical standards, in alignment with our values and risk appetite, and within the boundaries of applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and industry standards relevant for our business.\n\nCompliance is well embedded in our organisation and culture, with strong commitment and proactive involvement of the Management Board, and cooperation across the entire organisation to ensure compliance, taking into account the three lines of defence model.\n\nThe graphic below summarises:\n\n- -The key compliance risks that are assessed and monitored;\n- -The responsibilities of the compliance function throughout Van Lanschot Kempen (three lines of defence);\n- -The client segments in which these risks are assessed and monitored.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Compliance department is headed up by the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Chair of the Management Board. The Compliance department fulfils its responsibilities by providing advice and assistance to Van Lanschot Kempen's committees and management teams, including the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, and by continuously monitoring adherence to regulations within the company's day-to-day operations in the various client segments.",

        "page_content": "## Key compliance risks\n\n- -Financial crime risks: risks relating to client due diligence, anti-money laundering, sanction screening, client tax integrity, anti-bribery & corruption and gifts & entertainment;\n\nThe key compliance risks can be grouped into four categories:\n\n- -Business conduct risks : risks relating to conflicts of interest, market conduct, secondary positions and personal account dealing;\n- -Personal data integrity risks : risks relating to privacy, data retention/deletion and electronic communication/ recording.\n- -Client protection risks: risks relating to best execution/ order handling, client suitability, client classification, marketing, inducements and product governance;\n\n## Compliance in client segments and business lines across Van Lanschot Kempen\n\nIn the new organisational structure, the responsibilities for Client Management & Origination have been brought together. While respecting the different client segments, client needs, services provided by Van Lanschot Kempen and specific local regulatory requirements, compliance policies have been aligned to be applicable group-wide. This new organisational structure also enables best practices for one client segment to be applied to other client segments.\n\nIn addition to enhancing compliance in the various client segments, compliance related to products and services being offered by Investment Strategies & Solutions has also been enhanced. This means putting in place further procedures and controls to enhance adherence to compliance policies and regulations relating to product and investment advisory services.\n\n## Developments in 2021\n\nThe Compliance department has continued to enhance the compliance framework through dedicated efforts to revise and ensure implementation of the company's policies and procedures across client segments, as well as through further enhancements of the compliance risk management programme. Regulatory requirements are ever-increasing. This requires continued efforts by Compliance and the client segments across our business.\n\nAs a company, we have devoted substantial resources to strengthening the compliance framework and function. The compliance function was further strengthened in 2021 by expanding the Compliance department. The Management Board established various group-wide projects to revise and enhance compliance policies, procedures and controls, including those relating to the company's anti-financial crime framework and client tax integrity. In 2021, the enhancements relating to the anti-financial crime framework were implemented. The objectives of the group-wide projects were met, and Van Lanschot Kempen is currently well positioned to implement the enhancements identified for the other key compliance risk categories by early 2022. We have also continued the development and rollout of a dedicated compliance training programme for employees.\n\n## Privacy\n\nAs part of the Compliance department, we have a designated Data Protection Officer (DPO), who reports to the Management Board via the Privacy Committee. This is an independent position within the company. The DPO is responsible for representing the interests of people and\n\nparties who trust us with their data. The DPO also sets our group-wide data privacy policies covering personal data integrity, including the awareness programme for employees and contractors. These policies are just some of the ways in which we put our core value of \"discretion\" into practice.\n\nFor more information about compliance risk, see the discussion of risk management in the financial statements, Section 12, 'Compliance risk'.\n\n## Sustainability risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's risk management and control system is designed to manage internal and external risks. Sustainability risks, with climate change as the most prominent risk driver, fall into the category of external risks. Sustainability risk is a relatively new and highly complex focus area in the wealth management industry, affecting the whole organisation. Targets, processes and risks can only be efficiently addressed by an effective governance structure. To optimise our knowledge of sustainability risks, we have consolidated our overall expertise into our Sustainability Centre, while more direct sustainability expertise resides within the business. To promote efficient decision-making, we have created one main committee, the Sustainability Board, which includes two Management Board members. We have also created two sub-committees: the Sustainability Investment Council and the Sustainability NonInvestment Council, which cover our own balance sheet and organisation's sustainability risks. The Sustainability Board approves strategic sustainability priorities and monitors the implementation of the strategy and these priorities.\n\nIn 2021, our first sustainability risk policy was implemented, based on guidance on climate-related and environmental risks by the ECB. Our policy describes responsibilities for managing sustainability risks as well as the types of risk, whereby attention is mostly paid to physical and transition risks as a result of climate change. Physical risks include negative effects from adverse weather events, or businesses or assets becoming obsolete (stranded assets). Transition risks include risks that arise from the adjustment process towards aligning with sustainability requirements in a broad sense (i.e. regulatory risks, government measures, taxes, international treaties, etc.).\n\nGiven the nature of our clients, many environmental risks are not material for Van Lanschot Kempen as a firm. As a wealth manager, the majority of our lending exposure is to private individuals, and we do not have lending exposure to large corporates. For our limited lending to smaller businesses, we maintain a strict exclusion list for activities we do not wish to finance, and we carry out sustainability screening to identify other risks. In 2021, we improved methods to calculate impact and materiality. We also continued to enhance our dataset and monitor activities relating to the sustainability objectives of our own organisation, balance sheet and AuM, in order to establish a more accurate and dynamic overview of the (potential) impact of our actions on the environment. Lastly, we have been working to embed and integrate sustainability elements in all our core processes, controls, product development, reporting and so on, instead of creating separate activities that are additional to our existing processes.\n\nBased on a methodology that looks at various risk types (e.g. credit risk, operational risk), the main sustainability risks (physical and transition) and the available data, there is currently no reason to apply a management overlay to the",

        "page_content": "IFRS 9 models (Stages 1 and 2). In addition, the IFRS provision for Stage 3 is determined per individual credit file by the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department. If there are significant climate risks relating to loans by this department that play a role during the period the file is in default, these climate risks are included in the determination of the provision. A management overlay is therefore not necessary for Stage 3 either.\n\n## Risks to our operations\n\nOne of the more probable sustainability risks to our operations is the threat of flooding in certain parts of the Netherlands. Of our 29 office locations, 11 are well above sea level and are not exposed to river flooding; nine are protected by inland dikes; and nine are below sea level and/ or exposed to river flooding. If some of our offices flood, the affected employees will be able to work from home or at one of our other offices. Covid-19 proved that working with the majority of the staff at home is possible without any major interruption to business activities. The necessary information and systems for employees can be provided in such a scenario, while both our data centres in Eindhoven and 's Hertogenbosch are well above sea level if the dikes are no longer able to withstand the sea. Our back-up data centre in 's-Hertogenbosch has limited exposure to river flooding (one in 1,000 years), while our primary site in Eindhoven has very low risk of river flooding. The combined extremely low risk is acceptable for our organisation.\n\n## Risk to our balance sheet\n\nOur responsible lending policy takes environmental and social impact into consideration. This policy covers periodic sustainability screening (due diligence), via a risk filter, of all existing and new corporate loans, and includes factors such as human rights, social and labour issues, environment, anticorruption and bribery. During 2021, the screening did not identify any new material sustainability issues in the portfolio. The number of potentially high-risk borrowers totalled 16 at year-end 2021 (2020: nine). We continue to engage with these borrowers about specific sustainability risks and how they could be mitigated. For more information on this policy and its results, see our sustainability supplement and vanlanschotkempen.com/en/sustainability/ policy/banking-activities.\n\nA decade ago, a separate policy was created to assess the sustainability of financial institutions with which Van Lanschot Kempen has a banking relationship (vanlanschotkempen.com/en/sustainability/policy/bankingactivities). This policy aims to prevent the risk that client assets are exposed - through interbank loans or investments, for example - to institutions with weak or nonexistent sustainability policies. Van Lanschot Kempen challenges financial institutions that have not developed sufficiently visible policies. In 2021, there was no need to engage with any financial institutions in our portfolio, as all complied with our policy.\n\nSince 2016, we have been calculating and reporting on our balance sheet-related carbon emissions, mainly for mortgage loans, other loans and our investment portfolio. For our Private Clients segment, the most significant lending portfolio is our mortgage portfolio. While some climate change risks to this portfolio exist (e.g. financing homes exposed to flooding), we assess that the probability of these risks materialising is lower than other risk factors. For example, we expect that rising sea levels will be countered by additional infrastructure investments by the Dutch\n\ngovernment in sea/river defence structures. As a result, no separate restrictions have been put in place when granting new mortgages. We will undertake more granular stress testing in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, we encourage our clients to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and other types of property we finance. For example, we offer our Groenhypotheek (green mortgage), which provides financing at reduced interest rates to clients who are looking to make their homes more sustainable and energy-efficient.\n\nIn our other loans portfolio and remaining corporate banking loan book, we see limited climate change risk, mainly because of the regional and sectoral characteristics of our portfolio. Coupled with this, our corporate banking loan exposure is minimal, reflecting our earlier strategic choice to wind down this activity.\n\nWe also see limited transition risks in our equity exposure, stemming from our equity brokerage activities. The holding period (only a few days) and net exposures are quite limited (\u20ac7.3 million at year-end 2021), while transition risks in general tend to be longer-term. Furthermore, as a specialist broker, we focus on certain sectors - real estate, life sciences & healthcare, tech & fintech, renewables and infrastructure which limits the transition risks, while we have no exposure to polluting industries, for example.\n\nTo support our own managed funds, we provide seed capital and manage these funds in our management book. At yearend 2021, we had investments to the tune of nearly \u20ac200 million in our funds, of which 75% were in sustainable investment funds, categorised as such under the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). These sustainable investment funds either promote environmental and/or social characteristics (SFDR Article 8) or have sustainable investment objectives (SFDR Article 9). Under the SFDR and related disclosure transparency rules, there are strict requirements about managing principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors for SFDR products categorised as Article 8 and Article 9. Our managed funds that are exposed to environmental risks - including climate change adaptation and mitigation risks - fall within these categories. They also fall under Van Lanschot Kempen's broader climate change policy, by which we actively engage with issuers in our investment portfolios to assess their path towards climate neutrality as well as related climate change risks. On the basis of this, we deem the sustainability risks in our management book to be acceptable.\n\nWe have also undertaken work to assess the potential impact of a global temperature increase of 2\u00b0C or less on our balance sheet. We are working to understand the complex and non-linear relationships between the various sustainability risk factors on our balance sheet.\n\n## Risks to our assets under management\n\nIn our AuM activities, climate change risks are taken into account when investments are made or investment managers are selected. As part of our responsible and sustainable investing, we also have a climate change policy that was significantly strengthened in 2020. We have now set strong targets in line with the Paris Agreement on carbon emission reduction for our investment funds, to be met by 2025, 2030 and 2050 - enabling us to cope with the transition risks related to climate change. This also enhances resilience to physical climate change risks, as the companies",

        "page_content": "in these investment funds will take climate change into account. As physical risks will likely materialise more in certain regions and sectors (with physical assets) than others, we have started to gather physical climate data down to asset level for our real estate portfolios from a specialist climate data provider. We have further improved the implementation of our net-zero commitments by setting annual KPIs, starting in 2022, to reduce our carbon footprint according to the Paris Agreement targets.\n\nWe use climate scenarios for most of our managed global and European liquid portfolios to assess their climate resilience compared with the benchmark. We also use climate change risk indicators (proxies) from our climate data provider for several internal funds and some large clients. In 2020, we further integrated climate change mitigation into our current asset allocation scenarios via GDP assumptions (i.e. scenarios ranging from 1.5\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C of global heating). Central banks continue to provide more guidance on the impact of the inevitable energy transition on the global economy and at industry, sector and sub-sector levels. In 2021, we applied this guidance and incorporated DNB's climate stress tests for the equity market into our risk system. The results from these stress tests are presented on an absolute basis and compared with the benchmark. Drilling down to the impact of the stress tests on individual securities forms the basis of discussions with the portfolio managers.\n\nFor further information, see our disclosure in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): vanlanschotkempen.com/ results.\n\n## Regulatory impact\n\nThe increase and changes in regulations continued to pose a challenge for our organisation: Basel IV, sustainability and benchmark regulations all represent major changes for us going forward. In addition to new regulations, the number of data requests from regulators has also been increasing - in terms of both ad-hoc questionnaires and recurring reports.\n\nIn 2021, we continued with our Basel IV implementation, despite the postponement of the deadline. The impact of this revision to the regulatory framework on the business is still expected to be relatively limited. Our analysis includes changes to the approaches for credit risk and operational risk. Together with the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), these reforms will take effect as of 2025 with transitional arrangements. Implementing the new regulation will require substantial effort, as many definitions and reporting requirements have changed. Moreover, many activities were implemented to comply with the rapidly changing requirements on managing and reporting sustainability risks.\n\nIn October 2019, DNB announced its intention to introduce a minimum risk-weight floor for the residential mortgage loan portfolios of Dutch banks subject to the IRB approach in the autumn of 2020. This measure was postponed because of Covid-19, but was later implemented on 1 January 2022. The measure means that Dutch banks will need to hold more capital against their mortgage portfolios. It aims to support the banks' ability to absorb the impact of a potential housing price correction. The impact on our total risk exposure amount (TREA) was 15%, implying an impact on the CET 1 ratio of 3.2 percentage points. DNB previously indicated that the new measure will not be in addition to the Basel IV\n\nframework, which means that the impact is expected to disappear after the introduction of Basel IV.\n\n## Capital management\n\nAt the end of 2021, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio stood at 23.7%. In September, the ECB recommendation to postpone dividends ended. We therefore paid out the 2019 and remaining 2020 dividends in October 2021. Since our CET 1 ratio remains well above our target range of 15-17%, we aim to engage in acquisitions, and intend to leave room for these in our capital position. Whenever possible, we will also continue to pay out excess capital to shareholders, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nOur TREA declined by \u20ac268 million to approximately \u20ac3,927 million. At year-end 2021, our Tier 1 and total capital ratios stood at 26.3% (2020: 25.4%) and 30.1% (2020: 27.4%) respectively. The substantial improvements in Tier 1 and total capital ratios are due to the legal merger between Van Lanschot Kempen NV and Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV, which came into effect on 1 July 2021. As a result of this merger, we no longer need to apply a minority interest deduction to Tier 1 and total capital (at the consolidation level of Van Lanschot Kempen NV).\n\nIn July 2021, DNB informed us of a downward revision of the capital requirements that we need to meet. Our CET 1 requirement decreased from 7.8% to 5.9%, whereas the total supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) capital requirement (TSCR) declined from 13.9% to 10.5%.\n\nThis decrease in capital requirements mainly stems from adjustments in the way we establish the required capital buffer for credit risk. Previously, we applied the internal ratings based (IRB) method to determine the capital requirements for the majority of our loan book. However, due to changes in our portfolio composition (winding down the corporate banking loan book) and increased regulation regarding IRB models in general, we thoroughly revised our IRB models. Over recent years, we developed new IRB models for residential mortgages and migrated all other credit risk exposure to the standardised approach. During this transition period, we held extra capital for credit risk. As we have now completed our IRB revision, the SREP capital requirements have decreased.\n\nIn addition to the 5.9% CET 1 SREP requirement, we are subject to combined buffer requirements and Pillar 2 guidance (P2G). Both elements must be met by CET 1 capital alone.\n\n| SREP and overall capital  requirements from July 2021 (%)             |   CET 1 |   Tier 1 |   Total  capital |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|------------------|\n| Pillar 1                                                              |     4.5 |      6   |              8   |\n| Pillar 2                                                              |     1.4 |      1.9 |              2.5 |\n| Total SREP capital requirement                                        |     5.9 |      7.9 |             10.5 |\n| Capital conservation buffer                                           |     2.5 |      2.5 |              2.5 |\n| Countercyclical capital buffer                                        |     0   |      0   |              0   |\n| Overall capital requirement                                           |     8.4 |     10.4 |             13   |\n| Pillar 2 guidance (not disclosed) Capital ratios as per year-end 2021 |    23.7 |     26.3 |             30.1 |",

        "page_content": "The capital conservation buffer is currently the main element of the combined buffer requirements. It stands at 2.5% and reached its fully phased-in level in January 2019. The countercyclical buffer for the Netherlands is currently set at 0%. In its overview of financial stability, DNB indicated that it will gradually raise the countercyclical buffer to a \"neutral\" level of 2%, but only when the situation around the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on banks has been normalised. The systemic risk buffer does not apply to us. We are expected to comply with P2G by holding CET 1 capital, but P2G does not have a binding status and does not automatically restrict dividend distributions in the event of a breach.\n\nWith a CET 1 ratio of 23.7% and a total capital ratio of 30.1% at year-end 2021, we met all capital requirements, including P2G. The leverage ratio decreased to 6.3% at year-end 2021 (year-end 2020: 7.1%), well above the minimum Basel requirement of 3%. The leverage ratio decline is mainly due to a slightly larger balance sheet.\n\nBasel IV is an important dimension in our capital planning, as is the temporary minimum floor for residential mortgage risk weights that are derived from IRB models, imposed by DNB from January 2022. Taking Basel IV and the DNB risk weight floor into account, we expect our CET 1 ratio to remain above our target range of 15-17%.\n\n## Minimum required eligible liabilities (MREL)\n\nAs part of the single resolution mechanism (SRM) regulation, the National Resolution Authority (NRA) has imposed an indicative MREL target on us. This is not likely to become binding before 2024, although the NRA could request an intermediate target towards 2024 in the case of an MREL gap.\n\nThe MREL target has a loss absorption and a recapitalisation component (both 50%). Given the decline in our SREP capital requirements, we are awaiting a binding MREL target before we can assess any potential gaps. We will adjust our funding planning in the run-up to 2024 in order to fill the limited MREL gap that could arise after we receive the final targets.",

        "page_content": "## VAN LANSCHOT KEMPEN SHARES\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's market capitalisation stood at \u20ac899 million at year-end 2021. Depositary receipts for Van Lanschot Kempen's Class A ordinary shares have been traded on the Euronext Amsterdam stock market since 29 June 1999 (ISIN Code: NL0000302636; ticker: VLK.AS).\n\nThe issued share capital of Van Lanschot Kempen at 31 December 2021 consisted of 41,361,668 Class A ordinary shares ('shares') each having a nominal value of \u20ac1. We held 514,551 treasury shares at year-end 2021. Van Lanschot Kempen is included in the Amsterdam Small Cap Index and in the MSCI World Small Cap index.\n\n## Shareholders and depositary receipt holders\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's shareholder base changed somewhat during 2021. APG Asset Management, Reggeborgh and B.H.F. ten Doeschot sold (part of) their stake; Romij and J.B. Meulman became new shareholders. Pursuant to Chapter 5.3 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the disclosures below have been entered in the Register of Substantial Holdings as maintained by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The percentages reflect the number of shares or depositary receipts on the register on the disclosure dates and our current number of outstanding shares.\n\nDisclosure is required once a shareholder's interest reaches, exceeds or falls below a threshold value. The current interest of a shareholder or holder of depositary receipts may consequently differ from the interest reported on the disclosure date. On 31 December 2021, Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen held over 99.99% of Van Lanschot Kempen shares. For more information on Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen, see 'Corporate governance' on page 94.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's depositary receipt holders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement and employees jointly owned around 4.2% of our issued share capital at year-end (2020: 4.0%). A new employee share plan will be introduced in 2022: each Van Lanschot Kempen share that an employee buys - up to a maximum value of \u20ac2,500 - will be matched by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nOur creditworthiness is periodically assessed by Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Van Lanschot Kempen maintains its high creditworthiness by deploying its assets for the benefit of its clients and by taking on only such risks as can be understood and controlled. This ensures solid risk management processes as well as a strong capital and liquidity position. Our current credit ratings reflect our healthy capital and funding position along with our low risk profile. Van Lanschot Kempen currently has a BBB+ long-term credit rating from both S&P and Fitch.\n\n| Credit ratings                   | Standard & Poor's   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Long-term credit rating          | BBB+                | BBB+            |\n| Long-term credit rating  outlook | Stable outlook      | Stable outlook  |\n| Short-term credit rating         | A-2                 | F2              |\n| Date of latest report            | 25 March 2021       | 12 July 2021    |\n| Date of latest press release     | 24 June 2021        | 7 July 2021     |\n\n## Research coverage\n\nTwo sell-side analysts - from ABN AMRO and Kepler Cheuvreux respectively - actively track Van Lanschot Kempen and regularly publish equity research reports. Their details can be found at vanlanschotkempen.com/shareinformation.\n\n## Dividend policy and dividend for 2021\n\nOur aim is to distribute between 50% and 70% of our underlying net result attributable to shareholders. The result actually available for distribution is the net result adjusted for minority interests, the share of AT1 capital securities holders, and the net effect of selected special items. In 2021, the underlying net result available for distribution to shareholders amounted to \u20ac153.1 million, working out at underlying earnings per share of \u20ac3.74. 1\n\nOur strong results and solid capital position enable us to propose a dividend distribution of \u20ac2.00 per share to our shareholders (2020: \u20ac0.70 per share). The shareholders at the annual general meeting to be held on 25 May 2022 will be invited to adopt the dividend proposal.\n\nBased on the number of shares in issue at 31 December 2021 (excluding treasury shares), the proposed dividend payments will total \u20ac81.7 million, corresponding to a payout ratio of 53.4% of the underlying net result attributable to shareholders. This percentage amounts to 59.6% of net result attributable to shareholders. The proportion of net result attributable to shareholders that will not be paid out i.e. \u20ac55.3 million - will be added to the reserves.",

The minimum floor has a negative impact of 3.2%, which still puts our CET 1 ratio well ahead of our target range.\n\nWe aim to engage in acquisitions, and intend to leave room for these in our capital position.

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\nThis report gives an overview of the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2021. A description of the composition and operation of the Supervisory Board is set out in the notes on corporate governance (see page 94).\n\nThe report includes the achievement of corporate targets, the relationship with stakeholders and the relevant aspects of sustainability. It covers the internal organisation as well as the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees. It also covers the annual evaluation of the performance of the Supervisory Board, its committees and individual members.\n\n## Supervision\n\n## Achievement of corporate targets\n\nThe Supervisory Board can look back on a strong year, in which Van Lanschot Kempen showed growth in assets under management and earnings. In line with its strategy, this growth was achieved both organically and inorganically.\n\nThe Private Clients segment showed very strong organic growth with record net inflows. A different picture is shown by the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment's net outflows. The Investment Banking Clients segment continued its high number of Corporate Finance/ECM transactions in 2021.\n\nThe company also continued to grow inorganically by entering into a partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden, acquiring a 70% stake in this Belgian wealth manager. This partnership is transformational for the franchise in Belgium. The integration of clients, employees and funds from Hof Hoorneman Bankiers was also completed, according to plan.\n\nEven after these acquisitions, Van Lanschot Kempen's capital position remains very strong. The organisation will continue to optimise its capital position and ensure that there is still scope for potential acquisitions within the wealth management sector. If possible, the Management Board may also consider capital returns to shareholders, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nSustainability is important for both Van Lanschot Kempen and its stakeholders. In 2021, progress was made on setting more ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions. The governance around sustainability has also been further enhanced through the introduction of a Sustainability Centre and a Sustainability Board.\n\nRegulators are increasingly focusing on the prevention of money laundering and financial crime, and the impact of the energy transition on the financial sector. As a financial services company, complying with laws and regulations continues to be a key priority for Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nDiversity and inclusion is an increasingly important focus area. Based on the results of the employee engagement survey that happens once every two years, we can conclude that employees perceive Van Lanschot Kempen to be an inclusive organisation, but gender diversity among senior staff needs improvement.\n\n## Structure and functioning of risk management\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's principal risks, as well as the structure and functioning of its risk management and control systems, are discussed by the Risk Committee. In 2021, the committee's chair regularly reported its conclusions and recommendations to the Supervisory Board. Van Lanschot Kempen's risk appetite statement is subject to the Supervisory Board's annual approval. In 2021, four key compliance risks were included in the risk appetite statement (see page 58). The key compliance risks were discussed by the Risk Committee and the Audit and Compliance Committee. The statement for 2022 was approved at the Supervisory Board's December meeting. The 2022-24 capital and funding plan was also discussed and approved at the December meeting.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nFinancial reporting is discussed regularly at the Audit and Compliance Committee's meetings, which are also attended by the external auditors. After each meeting, the chair of the committee reports on committee discussions to the full Supervisory Board. All members of the Supervisory Board attended the Audit and Compliance Committee's meeting in 2021 at which the 2020 annual figures were discussed. The Supervisory Board approved the financial statements for 2020 on 24 February 2021.\n\nThe Supervisory Board decided to propose to the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2021 that it reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV (PwC) as external auditors for the 2022 financial year. The annual general meeting has reappointed PwC as external auditors for the 2022 financial year. In January 2022, the Supervisory Board decided to propose the reappointment of PwC for the 2023 financial year to the annual general meeting to be held on 25 May 2022.\n\n## Legal and regulatory compliance\n\nThe Supervisory Board is regularly provided with information on developments regarding the compliance framework; further development of the compliance programme; and group-wide projects to strengthen policies and control arrangements, especially concerning anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing, sanctions and client due diligence processes, and the supervision of the regulatory authorities regarding compliance with regulations. The Supervisory Board was informed periodically about the ongoing implementation of new legislation and regulations, such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SDFR), preparation for the new ESG reporting requirements under the EU Taxonomy, the Gender Balance Act, the amended European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on internal governance, and the EBA and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management board and key function holders. In addition, the Supervisory Board was informed about progress on compliance projects relating to the anti-financial crime framework, revision of compliance policies, client tax integrity policy and the on-site inspection by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) of the internal governance and risk management of the compliance function.",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly discussed Van Lanschot Kempen's relationship with its shareholders. The most important topics discussed with shareholders were the general development of Van Lanschot Kempen, the succession of Karl Guha by Maarten Edixhoven, the progress made on executing the company's wealth management strategy, the strategy and targets for 2025, organic and inorganic growth opportunities, the acquisition of 70% of the shares in Mercier Vanderlinden, Van Lanschot Kempen's strong capital base and capital strategy, and the company's sustainability profile and approach.\n\nThe Supervisory Board values its constructive relationship with the Works Council. In August 2021, Frans Blom, Bernadette Langius and Karin Bergstein attended the Works Council's meeting with the Management Board, at which the general course of business at Van Lanschot Kempen was discussed.\n\n## Relevant aspects of sustainability\n\nLaunched in 2021, a group-wide Sustainability Centre was formed to further achieve Van Lanschot Kempen's sustainability ambitions. The Risk Committee was informed about progress made on applying the company's responsible lending policy.\n\nIn October 2021, the Supervisory and Management Boards took part in an education session on sustainability. The Supervisory Board discussed climate change as well as the broader impacts of the process of adjusting to a lowercarbon economy. The scope and developments of the EU sustainability regulatory framework were also covered. This comprehensive set of sustainability regulations has an impact on various parts of the company's business, particularly through more stringent disclosure requirements. During the education session, the link between these regulations and Van Lanschot Kempen's sustainability ambitions was discussed, moving beyond compliance and recognising the strategic imperative and opportunities that these developments may bring for the financial sector in general and for Van Lanschot Kempen in particular. In that context, the conclusions of Maastricht University's research project (commissioned by Eumedion) on why and how sustainability is being embedded in Dutch listed companies were also shared.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is pleased to see that Van Lanschot Kempen has accelerated its efforts to integrate sustainability further into the organisation over the years, and put sustainability at the centre of its business operations and client solutions in 2021. Given the continuous developments in this field, as well as evolution towards a more purposedriven and value-based leadership within companies, sustainability remains a topic that requires ongoing attention from Van Lanschot Kempen going forward. The next step is to further integrate all relevant aspects of sustainability into its daily business and risk management processes.\n\n## Internal organisation\n\n## Composition of the Management  Board\n\nOn 27 May 2021, Erik van Houwelingen - Chair of the Management Board of Kempen Capital Management since 15 November 2020 - was appointed as member of the Management Board responsible for Investment Strategies & Solutions. With his appointment, the composition of the\n\nExecutive and Management Boards became identical. As a result, there was no further need for the Executive Board and it therefore ceased to exist in July 2021.\n\nOn 1 October 2021, Karl Guha stepped down as member and Chair of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board is sincerely grateful to him for his vision and leadership, and for his major contribution to the transformation of the company from a universal bank to an integrated wealth management firm with a clearly defined market position. Maarten Edixhoven succeeded Karl Guha as Chair of the Management Board on 1 October 2021. The Supervisory Board is very pleased with his appointment.\n\nThe Management Board currently consists of Maarten Edixhoven (Chair), Constant Korthout, Arjan Huisman, Richard Bruens and Erik van Houwelingen.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, Van Lanschot Kempen changed its organisational structure by moving from a business linedriven organisation towards an integrated model. The new organisational structure also led to an adjustment in the areas of responsibility for most members of the Management Board. Richard Bruens became responsible for the newly formed Client Management & Origination domain, in which the company has combined all its client-focused staff and activities across its client groups. Erik van Houwelingen leads the newly set-up Investment Strategies & Solutions domain that covers all in-house and externally selected investment solutions and services. Arjan Huisman is responsible for Digital, Advanced Analytics & Technology as well as for Operations, which have now been centralised to streamline processes and increase efficiency. The portfolio of the Chair now also covers Business Innovation & Development and the Sustainability Centre, whilst Constant Korthout's areas of responsibility in Finance and Risk Management remain unchanged.\n\n## Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nJeanine Helthuis stepped down as member of the Supervisory Board after the annual general meeting on 27 May 2021, as her second four-year term expired that day. We are very grateful for her valuable contribution to the Board over the past eight years. She was succeeded by Brigitte Boone, who was appointed as a new member of the Supervisory Board at the extraordinary general meeting on 22 September 2021.\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nThe Supervisory Board held 12 meetings in 2021. The Management Board attends the formal meetings of the Supervisory Board and prepares detailed supporting information. Regular items on the agenda of these meetings included the company's strategy, developments within the various business activities, corporate governance, risk management, compliance, IT, operations, financial results, the annual budget, capital strategy, the capital and funding plan and HR topics. The Supervisory Board was informed regularly about the impact of Covid-19 on Van Lanschot Kempen and its employees, as well as the measures that were implemented to guarantee the continuity of (operational) processes. In addition, the Supervisory Board discussed the further simplification of the legal structure of Van Lanschot Kempen through a legal merger between Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV and Van Lanschot Kempen NV, the postponement of part of the 2020 dividend payment and subsequent payout of the",

These meetings give the Supervisory Board the opportunity to reflect on agenda items and discuss possible items that require attention in advance of the regular meetings, as well as to discuss matters such as the composition of the Management and Supervisory Boards and the evaluation of how both boards are functioning. The Chair of the Management Board was invited to attend some of these meetings, depending on the topics being discussed.\n\nIn 2021, specific attention was paid to the successor of the Chair of the Management Board. At the meeting in February, the Supervisory Board discussed the performance of the members of the Management Board in 2020. Because of restrictions relating to the Covid-19 pandemic, most of the meetings of the Supervisory Board in 2021 took place virtually.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received the information needed to perform its tasks from the Management Board. Information was also provided by the external auditors. Employees from\n\nwithin the organisation regularly attended meetings to provide additional information on specific topics within their respective fields. The agendas for Supervisory Board meetings were drawn up by the Company Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn June 2021, the Supervisory Board held a meeting off-site to discuss diversity, particularly in relation to the Management Board and senior staff. The Supervisory Board is encouraged by the steps that have been taken regarding diversity, and is keen to see further steps in 2022. This topic is an important priority for the Supervisory Board.\n\nSupervisory Board members were rarely absent from the Supervisory Board meetings or meetings of its committees. The table below shows the composition of Supervisory Board committees, and the attendance rate of each member of the Supervisory Board at the Board and committee meetings.\n\n## Supervisory Board committees\n\n## Composition of Supervisory Board committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has appointed four committees from among its members. Each committee advises the Supervisory Board and prepares decision-making by the Board in its designated area of interest. These committees meet separately throughout the year. The main considerations and conclusions of the committees are shared with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board remains fully responsible for all decisions.\n\n| Composition and  attendance rate   | Supervisory Board   | Audit and  Compliance  Committee   | Risk Committee   | Selection and  Appointment  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Frans Blom                         | 100% (Chair)        | 100%                               |                  | 100%  (Chair)                           | 100% 2                    |\n| Manfred Schepers                   | 92.3%               | 100%                               | 100% (Chair)     |                                         |                           |\n| Karin Bergstein                    | 96.2%               | 100%                               |                  |                                         | 100%                      |\n| Brigitte Boone 1                   | 100% 1              |                                    | 100% 2           | 100% 2                                  |                           |\n| Jeanine Helthuis 3                 | 100%                | 100%                               |                  | 100%                                    | 100%                      |\n| Bernadette Langius                 | 100%                |                                    | 100%             |                                         | 100% (Chair)              |\n| Maarten Muller                     | 100%                |                                    | 100%             | 100%                                    | 100%                      |\n| Lex van Overmeire                  | 100%                | 75% (Chair)                        | 66.6%            |                                         |                           |\n\n## Audit and Compliance Committee\n\nAs of 27 May 2021, Jeanine Helthuis stepped down as a member of the Audit and Compliance Committee, as her second four-year term as member of the Supervisory Board expired, reducing the number of committee members to four. The Audit and Compliance Committee held four meetings in 2021. A delegation from the Management  Board attended these meetings.

The main topics discussed were the audit scope, materiality, key audit matters and (interim) findings as reported by the external auditors. In addition, the committee monitored the actions taken in response to these findings. The Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Committee on monitoring the quarterly non-financial risk reports and on key audit matters such as reliability and continuity of the IT environment and the fair value measurement of specific financial instruments. The committee reviews the external auditors' independence, audit quality, communication and fees every year. On 27 January 2022, the functioning of PwC in 2021 was evaluated. The outcome of the evaluation resulted in the proposal to reappoint PwC for the 2023 financial year; the committee reached the decision to do this independently.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee followed developments on compliance in the organisation and the execution of the compliance programme, and the work of the Internal Audit department throughout the year. Progress on key initiatives in both departments was discussed. The annual plan and quarterly reports from the Internal Audit and Compliance departments were discussed as part of the committee's evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of Van Lanschot Kempen's governance, policy framework, risk management and internal control systems. The committee discussed developments in cybersecurity, the annual evaluation of the Audit Charter, the new Compliance Charter, the further development of the compliance risk management framework, revisions to the compliance policies, the SIRA 2021, fraud prevention and initiatives to further mature compliance risk management at Van Lanschot Kempen. Close attention was paid to the antifinancial crime framework targeted at compliance with obligations under anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and other relevant legislation. The committee also received detailed information on projects dedicated to further developing the anti-financial crime framework, such as the client tax integrity policy.\n\nExtra attention was paid to the progress and final outcome of DNB's on-site inspection of the internal governance and risk management of the compliance function. Van Lanschot Kempen has acknowledged the observations and recommendations of DNB and has prepared a response that reflects its commitment to further enhancing its compliance function.\n\nInternal Audit reports presented the results of reviews of the risk & control framework, the implementation and operation of IT systems, the performance of IT systems, the management of the loan portfolio, and the impact of the changes to the organisational structure by moving from a business-line driven organisation to an integrated model. The Audit and Compliance Committee discussed audit findings and coverage of the audit universe. The key areas discussed included the response to Covid-19, cybercrime, digitalisation, changes in the technological landscape, the consequences of using external parties and moving IT to cloud-based solutions,  the transformation to an agile way of working, the product approval and review process (PARP), EU sustainability regulations, tax policies, the integration of the activities of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers and the acquisition of 70% of the shares in Mercier Vanderlinden.\n\nInformation provided by the compliance function included the quarterly compliance reports, as well as information on compliance-related projects, risk assessments and other developments with regard to the management of compliance risks and the strengthening of the compliance framework across the organisation. The quarterly compliance reports included information about all elements of the compliance programme, such as advisory, regulatory developments, compliance risk management, monitoring, policy management, and training and awareness. Compliance reports also provided information on the progress of the broader projects on policy harmonisation and the strengthening of risk and control arrangements in Van Lanschot Kempen's various client segments. Reporting by Compliance included reports by the Data Protection Officer on personal data integrity and adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In addition, reports from Compliance and Internal Audit provided information about contact and communication with regulators.\n\nBased on the reports by both internal and external auditors, the Audit and Compliance Committee concludes that the internal control environment is adequate for external financial reporting purposes.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nBrigitte Boone was appointed as a new member of the Risk Committee as of 28 October 2021. With her appointment, the number of members of the committee has increased to five. The Risk Committee met three times in 2021. Its meetings were also attended by the CEO, CFO/CRO, Managing Director of Risk Management and Managing Director of Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery. The committee paid careful attention to the credit, non-financial, market and interest rate risks to which the organisation is exposed. The committee also discussed internal developments in the Risk Management department, the integration of Kempen Capital Management's risk team with the group Risk Management department, and the new governance, risk and compliance (GRC) tool.\n\nThe quarterly risk appetite reports were discussed by the Risk Committee. In all meetings, specific attention was paid to reviewing whether Van Lanschot Kempen's risk profile was within the limits set by Van Lanschot Kempen's risk appetite. At its meetings, the committee discussed credit risk, execution risk of specific change projects, data management risk, cybercrime and IT risk, business continuity risk, the impact of Covid-19 on the risk profile of the organisation and the possible impact on provisioning. Interest rate and market risk developments were discussed based on factors including duration analyses, the development of value at risk, and stress tests. Continuous attention was paid to IT and internal control risks during periods that the majority of employees were working from home due to Covid-19 restrictions. Preventive measures were put in place, and no major incidents occurred. The results of these measures and their impact on employees and their working environment were discussed by the Risk Committee.",

At its February meeting, the committee discussed the Management Board's key performance indicators (KPIs) for 2021, the 2020 remuneration report and the 2020 variable remuneration paid to staff of Van Lanschot Kempen. The amount available for variable remuneration of Van Lanschot Kempen staff for 2021 was among the topics discussed at the December meeting.\n\n## Assuring governance quality\n\n## Evaluation of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board performs an annual evaluation of the functioning of the Supervisory Board, its committees and individual members. The evaluation is carried out under the guidance of an external adviser once every three years. In 2021, the evaluation process was carried out using a questionnaire completed by each Supervisory Board member. The evaluation includes the participation and contribution of each member of the Supervisory Board, the knowledge and experience of the Supervisory Board collectively, the interaction and dynamics within the Supervisory Board, the communication and provision of information, the decision-making process and quality of the information provided for Supervisory Board meetings, the independence of mind of the individual members, and the relationship with the Management Board. The outcomes of the evaluation were discussed by the Supervisory Board at a meeting in January 2022, and recommendations will be implemented as a result.\n\nThe Supervisory Board concluded that the Board and its committees are functioning well, and that its composition is in line with the required profile in terms of suitability, expertise and diversity, and also complies with Principle 2.1 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The Supervisory Board also concluded that the necessary knowledge of the Belgian market was achieved through the appointment of Brigitte Boone to the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, we decided to make cybersecurity an annual topic in the permanent education programme for the Supervisory and Management Boards. The Supervisory Board also concluded that it is important to meet informally more often, as this has been impacted by Covid-19. Conclusions and recommendations relevant to the Management Board will be shared with the Management Board.\n\n## Evaluation of the Management Board\n\nIn February 2022, the Supervisory Board evaluated the functioning of the Management Board as a whole and that of its individual members based on the KPIs for 2021. The Supervisory Board sets the KPIs for the Management Board every year. These KPIs consist of Van Lanschot Kempen's external financial and non-financial KPIs, with additional KPIs on financial and risk management. The financial KPIs for 2021 include the return on CET 1, operating expenses, risk appetite and efficiency ratio. The non-financial KPIs include the sustainability ambitions of Private Clients and Wholesale & Institutional Clients, reductions in carbon emissions, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and the employer Net Promoter Score. For further information on performance against these KPIs, see page 22.\n\nThe assessment of the KPIs is included as the basis for the collective assessment of the Management Board and the individual assessment of its members for 2021. In addition, a delegation of the Supervisory Board reviewed the 2021 performance and lessons learned with the individual members of the Management Board in January 2022. The outcomes from these meetings were discussed by the members of the Supervisory Board, who concluded that the members of the Management Board performed well in 2021, both collectively and individually. The conclusions and recommendations relevant to the Management Board were shared with its members. The 2022 KPIs for the Management Board are in line with Van Lanschot Kempen's financial and non-financial KPIs for 2022 (see page 19).\n\nThe Management Board evaluated its own functioning and effectiveness on a regular basis during its off-sites. Board members gave each other feedback on their strengths and points to consider, and reflected on these.\n\n## Tax integrity policy\n\nIn October 2021, it was made public that Maarten Muller had invested in an ecological impact company, with interests in Kenya and Tanzania, that is registered in the British Virgin Islands. In the interests of Van Lanschot Kempen, Maarten Muller has decided to sell his investment. At the request of the Supervisory Board, a policy on tax-related matters for members of the Supervisory and Management Boards was subsequently designed and is in the process of being implemented. On the basis of this policy, the personal investments of the members of the Supervisory and Management Boards will be assessed.\n\n## On-boarding programme\n\nAll new members of the Management and Supervisory Boards complete an extensive on-boarding programme when appointed. The programme is tailor-made for each newly appointed Board member, as their knowledge and experience varies. The aim of the on-boarding programme is to ensure that new Board members have thorough knowledge of Van Lanschot Kempen and its business activities in order to fulfil their role within the Management and Supervisory Boards.\n\nIn 2021, specific attention was paid to the on-boarding programme for Maarten Edixhoven in preparation for his appointment as Chair of the Management Board. This resulted in a smooth leadership transition from Karl Guha to Maarten Edixhoven.\n\n## Education\n\n- -Corporate governance;\n\nThe members of the Supervisory and Management Boards take part in a continuous education programme. In 2021, three such meetings were organised. Topics covered included:\n\n- -Shareholder activism;\n- -Client (tax) structures.\n- -ESG, sustainability regulations and the sustainability ambitions of Van Lanschot Kempen;\n\nThese education sessions were positively rated by the members of the Supervisory and Management Boards.",

Currently, there are no dependent members on the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn the event of a potential conflict of interest relating to a particular topic, the Supervisory Board member concerned is not allowed to participate in discussions or decision-making on that topic.

On 28 May 2020, the annual general meeting (AGM) approved the remuneration policies for the Management Board with a majority of 93.7% of the votes cast and for the Supervisory Board with 100% of the votes cast.\n\nThe 2020 remuneration report was approved by the AGM (advisory vote) with a majority of 99.35% of the votes cast.

This leads to specific challenges from a remuneration perspective, especially within the Dutch regulatory context.\n\nWe compete with large financial institutions in our sectors. We strongly believe that our future success requires a robust Management Board with a proven track record in wealth management and related investment banking activities, while experience in digitalisation and advanced analytics is also key. As a consequence, the remuneration of the Management Board members should be such that Van Lanschot Kempen is able to attract and retain the necessary talent, which includes future board members from highly specialist wealth management and technology firms. Moreover, the Management Board's remuneration package must be structured to fit properly within the Dutch context.\n\n## Remuneration principles remained unchanged in 2021\n\nWe believe in rewarding long-term sustainable performance to help achieve our long-term strategy. This is reflected in our Management Board remuneration policy. Since 2015, this consists of fixed remuneration only (no variable remuneration) and includes a large proportion in depositary receipts for",

These were approved at our 2020 AGM. The remuneration structure for the Management and Supervisory Boards remained unchanged in 2021.\n\n## Total remuneration in 2021\n\nWe review total remuneration for the Management Board periodically, taking into account internal and external perspectives. When adopting the Management Board remuneration package, we consider pay ratios within the company and remuneration policies in place across the wider workforce. Moreover, the Remuneration Committee takes note of individual Management Board members' views regarding the amount and structure of their own remuneration.\n\nIn line with the Management Board remuneration policy approved by shareholders, the Supervisory Board indexed the fixed remuneration of the members of the Management Board. The indexation was applied on 1 January and 1 October 2021, in line with the wider workforce. The indexation amounted to 0.75% in January and 0.49% in October, and was maximised by the derived Consumer Price Index (CPI) applicable over 2020.\n\nFor more information about the Management Board's remuneration package and pay ratios, see 'Remuneration of the Management Board in 2021' on page 88.\n\n## Performance management\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses and challenges the performance of the Management Board based on a set of financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs are strongly aligned with KPIs for the rest of the organisation, and reflect both the interests of its stakeholders and its ambitions as a wealth manager. In assessing the performance of the Management Board, great value is attached to their performance as a team. This is the starting point of the performance assessment, given the company's integrated wealth management model. If the performance of a Management Board member is consistently under par, the Supervisory Board may dismiss the responsible Board member (after consulting the general meeting).\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWe take stakeholders' views very seriously and welcome an open dialogue on all aspects of remuneration. In preparation for the 2020 AGM, a delegation from the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board consulted with a large cross-section of the company's shareholder base, proxy advisers, the Works Council, various client groups and Dutch political parties. At these meetings, an explanation was given about SRD II; the Management and Supervisory Board remuneration policy; the Supervisory Board's view on rewarding long-term sustainable performance; and the Dutch context, such as the Dutch law on remuneration of financial undertakings, and the Dutch Corporate Governance and Banking Codes.\n\nThe dialogue with stakeholders was very constructive. Gaining their views on executive pay in general, and Van Lanschot Kempen's remuneration policy in particular, was very valuable.\n\n## Looking ahead to 2022\n\nThe remuneration policy for the Management and Supervisory Boards will remain unchanged in 2022.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 23 February 2022\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nBernadette Langius , Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to remuneration: rewarding long-term sustainable performance\n\nOur purpose is the preservation and creation of wealth, in a sustainable way, for our clients and the society we serve.\n\nAs a company, we believe that the generation of wealth and its redistribution through taxation are critical to the process of creating and maintaining stable, successful societies. Given that social cohesion necessitates such wealth creation, we believe that wealth management cannot be the preserve of a few but is a necessity for all. We create wealth, economic growth, jobs and tax income via our services to entrepreneurs, as well as contributing to the realisation of societal goals via the preservation and creation of wealth for asset owners, including private individuals and pension funds.\n\nWe believe that wealth is not just about financial assets; essential as these may be, wealth is about all the things that we value in life. In a broader sense, wealth represents the collective wisdom of a society and the cultural norms and values that sustain it. Although our primary objective is to help our clients with the financial aspects of wealth, we endeavour to serve their broader objectives as well.\n\nWe serve clients across the social spectrum and in several segments - Private Clients, Wholesale & Institutional Clients and Investment Banking Clients - as a trusted partner, and assist them in preserving and creating wealth sustainably. Investing for the long term is no longer just about looking for the greatest returns by a future date; it's also about ensuring the liveability of the planet for the generations to come. We believe that serving the long-term interests of our clients helps create a platform for sustainable investing and societal stability.\n\nThis view is reflected in our approach to remuneration. The remuneration of the Management Board consists of fixed remuneration only, and includes a large proportion in Van Lanschot Kempen shares (with a five-year lock-up period), creating a strong focus on the long-term continuity of the company and subsequent strong client relations.\n\n## WE BELIEVE IN:\n\n## Focusing on the long term\n\nVariable remuneration is scrutinised in Dutch society, especially in the financial sector. The use of variable remuneration can lead to a focus on short-term performance. As we believe in rewarding long-term sustainable performance, we ended all variable remuneration for the Management Board in 2015. Since then, we have only paid fixed remuneration to the Management Board.\n\n## Rewarding sustainable performance\n\nWe pay out a substantial proportion of fixed remuneration in shares to ensure our Board members focus on long-term, sustainable performance. To maximise this effect, these shares are subject to a five-year lock-up period (during which the shares cannot be sold).\n\n## Creating a sense of ownership\n\nWe believe in aligning our interests with those of our shareholders through a high level of personal share ownership. Our share ownership guidelines stipulate that Management Board members must hold Van Lanschot Kempen shares with a value equal to or above the cash portion of two years of their gross salary (for as long as they remain in office). If the share price is not performing, the Board members must keep increasing their holdings.\n\n## Performance management\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses and challenges the performance of the Management Board based on a set of financial and nonfinancial KPIs. In assessing the Management Board's performance, great value is attached to their performance as a team. The Supervisory Board evaluates both the performance of the Management Board as a whole and that of the individual Management Board members on an annual basis. Performance discussions are held with the individual members. The Management Board also annually evaluates its own functioning as a whole and that of its individual members. If an individual Management Board member underperforms, they are held accountable. If no improvement is realised, the Management Board member can be dismissed by the Supervisory Board at any time (after consulting the annual general meeting).\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has developed a set of KPIs focusing on long-term value creation. These financial and non-financial KPIs reflect both the interests of stakeholders and our ambitions as a wealth manager. They are in line with the company's values and will be reassessed from time to time. The KPIs that are relevant from a strategy and stakeholder perspective are disclosed in the sections about our value creation per type of capital on pages 26-44. These KPIs are also applicable to the members of the Management Board. Van Lanschot Kempen aims for the KPIs and performance management applicable to the Management Board to be fully aligned with the rest of the organisation.",

Erik van Houwelingen was appointed as a member of the Management Board by the AGM on 27 May 2021. He has been Chair of Kempen Capital Management NV since November 2020 and is responsible for Investment Strategies & Solutions. His compensation is in line with the Management Board remuneration policy.\n\nOn 22 September 2021, Maarten Edixhoven was appointed as member and Chair of the Management Board by the extraordinary general meeting (EGM), effective 1 October 2021. His remuneration package is in line with the Management Board remuneration policy, as approved by the AGM on 28 May 2020. The main elements of the agreement for services between Maarten Edixhoven and Van Lanschot Kempen are specified in Appendix 3 to the agenda of the EGM. His remuneration consists of fixed remuneration only. This fixed remuneration is paid partly in cash and partly in depositary receipts for shares in Van Lanschot Kempen with a lock-up period. This aligns the Management Board members' interests with those of the shareholders.\n\nThe Supervisory Board indexed the fixed remuneration of the members of the Management Board. The indexation was applied on 1 January and 1 October 2021 (in line with the wider workforce). The indexation amounted to 0.75% in January and 0.49% in October, and was maximised by the derived CPI applicable over 2020. It was granted fully in cash, in accordance with the Management Board remuneration policy. The remuneration paid to the Management Board in 2021 and 2020 is presented in the table on the following page.",

We have not made use of any discretion when applying the policy, except for using the indexation clause for the Management Board.\n\n## Compliance with our remuneration policy\n\n## Total remuneration management\n\nWe review total remuneration for the Management Board periodically, taking into account internal and external considerations.\n\n## Internal pay ratios, fairness and wider workforce considerations\n\nWhen adopting the Management Board remuneration package, we consider pay ratios within the company - attaching importance to the need for a sound pay ratio. The development of the pay ratio is discussed annually with the Works Council.\n\nA comparison of the CEO's remuneration package and the average labour cost 7 of an employee within Van Lanschot Kempen results in a pay ratio of 11:1, the same as in 2020. Trade unions apply the rule of thumb that the pay ratio should be a maximum of 20:1.\n\nAs part of the review of Management Board remuneration, we take into account the remuneration policies in place across the wider workforce. This includes considering the structure of remuneration packages at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how these evolve across the different levels of the organisation. For more detailed information on Management Board remuneration versus remuneration for the wider workforce (as well as company\n\nperformance), see 'Supplementary disclosure related to Management Board remuneration' on page 90.\n\n## External considerations\n\nWe periodically assess the remuneration levels of the Management Board versus external market levels. For this purpose, we use a well-balanced, focused group of companies, which reflects our talent market for Management Board positions. This serves as one of many checks in the determination of remuneration levels.\n\nWe are convinced that market capitalisation does not drive talent. Our talent market is much broader than that of our direct competitors. This is evidenced by our current Management Board members, who were consistently hired from top-notch larger firms. The relevant market includes both financial services companies and non-financial industry companies, both Dutch and international, and companies that are similar to and larger in size than Van Lanschot Kempen. The relative size of the company versus our competitors drives the need to attract better people than the competition. Prompted by our business strategy, we are willing to pay for the best people in the market. Typically, this talent comes from companies that are larger than ours.\n\nOur external reference market consists of the following types of company:\n\n- -Dutch banks: Although not all of the country's banks are directly comparable in terms of activities and size, these companies are subject to the same regulatory framework and are part of the same public debate.\n- -Specialist wealth management companies: We are a (highly) specialist company and need to be able to attract specialists to further grow the business. As there are no other standalone specialist wealth management companies of comparable size in the Netherlands, we look at companies active in Western Europe. We take into account standalone companies, broadly comparable in terms of number of employees and type of professional setting.",

        "page_content": "- -Other Dutch companies: Although other banks and specialist wealth management companies are important from a talent market perspective, our talent pool does not only consist of financial services companies. For example, in pursuing our wealth management strategy, professional qualifications are key - including the ability to adapt to technological changes. Because of this, our peer group also consists of other, non-financial Dutch companies. These companies are larger than ours, reflecting our experience that talent suitable for our Management Board is likely to be attracted (and lost) to larger companies.\n\nThe peer group is in line with requirements as laid down in the Dutch Banking Code. This code prescribes that the peer group should be composed of comparable positions both inside and outside the financial industry, including the relevant international context. If we change our remuneration policy in the future, we will also review our Management Board peer group. The composition of the peer group currently is set out in the table below.\n\n| Management Board peer group              | Management Board peer group   | Management Board peer group   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Specialist wealth  management  companies | Dutch banks                   | Other Dutch companies         |\n| BIL                                      | ABN AMRO                      | Aegon                         |\n| Degroof Petercam                         | ING Groep                     | ASML                          |\n| Julius B\u00e4r                               | NIBC Bank                     | Boskalis Westminster          |\n| Quintet                                  | Rabobank                      | DSM                           |\n| Lombard Odier                            |                               | KPN                           |\n| Vontobel                                 |                               | NN Group                      |\n|                                          |                               | Vopak                         |\n\nAs for the Management Board's overall total remuneration level, the objective is to remain competitive and to occupy a position below the median of the peer group. When establishing more specific positioning against market data, we take into account that some of the companies are substantially larger than ours. As a result, the current remuneration packages of our Management Board members occupy a position far below the median of the peer group.\n\nFollowing feedback from stakeholders, in 2019 we asked Willis Towers Watson (WTW) to update the market assessment for the Management Board. No changes were made in the companies selected, but we asked WTW to benchmark one level deeper in the organisation for the larger firms in the peer group (at similar job levels). This means that our CEO was compared with positions that report to the CEO (CEO-1 level); for the other Management Board positions, divisional heads were included that report to CEO-1 level (i.e. CEO-2 level). As these positions do not have formal board responsibilities, a standard board premium (in line with market practice) was applied to the base salary levels. Based on this updated analysis, we found that the CEO and CFO are still placed below median market levels (in the 40 th percentile for the CEO and 44 th percentile for the CFO), while the other Management Board members are placed at median market levels.\n\n## Management Board performance\n\nAs indicated in our approach to remuneration, the performance of the Management Board is assessed based on non-financial and financial KPIs. For 2021, the following KPIs (selected from a strategic and stakeholder perspective) were included in the KPIs of the Management Board. For a comprehensive overview of the Management Board KPIs, see the sections about our value creation per type of capital on pages 26-44.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|               | KPIs                                        | Targets   | Performance in  2021 8   | Supervisory Board  assessment 2021   |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Financial     | CET 1 ratio                                 | 15-17%    | 23.7%                    | l                                    |\n|               | Return on equity (CET 1)                    | 10-12%    | 15.7%                    | l                                    |\n|               | Efficiency ratio                            | 70-72%    | 68.9%                    | l                                    |\n| Non-financial | Net Promoter Score (NPS) a.

Our remuneration policy for other employees is in line with our strategy and purpose, and contributes to long-term value creation.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nEmployees' fixed remuneration reflects their relevant work experience and organisational responsibilities. In 2019, we implemented a new job and career framework that consistently links the weight of each job to a pay line. The pay lines are based on external market data and are differentiated to ensure we pay competitive salaries across the organisation. The pay lines are fully transparent, promote better pay-for-performance focus, and have been set up with clear guidelines on pay-related decisions and governance.\n\n## Equal pay\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen operates a merit-based remuneration policy, seeking not to discriminate on the basis of gender, age, nationality, social status or cultural background. We periodically investigate this and, if necessary, make adjustments to equalise pay. In 2021, we further analysed the gender pay gap at different levels in the organisation to determine whether there are any unexplained differences. As a result, we concluded that our unexplained (corrected) gender pay gap is under 4%. While there is work to be done to correct this, it compares favourably with the average pay gap in the Netherlands of 5.5% and the average within Dutch financial institutions of 13%.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nOur variable remuneration policies cover all employees (excluding the members of the Management Board). Each individual grant is subject to meeting the criteria as described in this section.\n\nOur variable remuneration policies comply with all relevant laws and regulations. The average variable remuneration of all Van Lanschot Kempen employees who work (largely) in the Netherlands does not exceed 20% of their fixed remuneration. However, for a small number of employees, we may grant variable remuneration of up to 100% of fixed remuneration. These deviations require separate approval from the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Variable remuneration funding\n\nThe Management Board annually establishes a variable remuneration pool, from which individual variable remuneration awards are made. The size of the pool (or the pool funding) depends on achievement of financial and nonfinancial KPIs, and is subject to Supervisory Board approval. Once the size of the variable remuneration pool has been established, the Management Board decides how the pool will be allocated.\n\n## Variable remuneration allocation\n\nThe individual allocation of variable remuneration depends on individual performance, market competitiveness and special factors.\n\nIndividual performance is measured by assessing the achievement of KPIs, as set at the beginning of the year. These indicators can be financial and non-financial, with some departments applying only non-financial criteria. For the departments that use both financial and non-financial indicators, at least 50% of the allocation of any variable remuneration is based on non-financial criteria, such as showing the desired professional behaviour, improving client satisfaction, developing new products or solutions for clients, and improving internal processes, policies or systems. The financial performance indicators include nothing that might encourage irresponsible risk-taking.",

        "page_content": "Variable remuneration is only awarded if:\n\n- -It is justified by the performance of Van Lanschot Kempen, the relevant client segment and the individual employee;\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position allows;\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen meets the prevailing buffer requirements under the EU's Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft) and its implementing legislation;\n- -The employee has received a good performance assessment, has met compliance targets, has not been subject to disciplinary measures, and has not taken any risks that fall outside Van Lanschot Kempen's accepted risk appetite.\n- -The risks taken have been reassessed and no material risks have occurred that were not expected or factored in;\n\n## Variable remuneration pay-out\n\nVariable remuneration up to \u20ac50,000 gross is paid out in cash directly. Above this amount, 50% of any variable remuneration is paid out directly, whereas the other 50% is deferred for a period of four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on Van Lanschot Kempen meeting the prevailing buffer requirements (as mentioned above).\n\nThe Management Board may, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, hold or claw back all or part of the pay-out if pay-outs have taken place on the basis of incorrect information, or have been made in conflict with the variable remuneration policy and/or applicable legislation and regulations:\n\n- -Unconditional variable remuneration previously paid to an employee (or former employee). This might occur if, for instance, payment was based on incorrect information about performance or about the conditions on which the variable remuneration depended (claw back).\n- -Deferred, conditional, variable remuneration previously awarded to an employee (or former employee), if payment of the variable remuneration would be considered unfair or unreasonable (hold back);\n\n## Remuneration in 2021\n\nVariable remuneration totalling \u20ac23.0 million was awarded to employees (including identified staff) over 2021 (2020: \u20ac12.2 million). Five people received total annual remuneration of over \u20ac1 million in 2021 (2020: two people).\n\n## Long-term share plan\n\nOur 2011 long-term share plan allows us to award variable remuneration in the form of Van Lanschot Kempen shares to certain key employees (including identified staff). In this case, 60% of each award is unconditional, whereas 40% of each award is deferred for a period of four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on Van Lanschot Kempen meeting the prevailing buffer requirements (as mentioned above).\n\n## Pensions\n\nAs of 2020, all our employees participate in the new Van Lanschot Kempen defined contribution pension plan. Management Board members do not participate in this plan as they receive an individual pension contribution. We monitor external developments regarding alignment between executive pensions and broader employee pension arrangements, and the possible impact that these may have in the Netherlands.\n\n## Remuneration policy for identified staff\n\nIdentified staff are employees whose activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the business. For these employees, performance measurement is the same as for other employees, but additional rules for the pay-out of variable remuneration apply.\n\nAs a general rule, any pay-out to identified staff is made 50% in cash and 50% in Van Lanschot Kempen shares. As an exception 12 to this, the variable remuneration of identified staff working at Kempen Capital Management is paid 50% in cash and 50% in a flexible mix of Van Lanschot Kempen shares and investments in funds managed.\n\nA lock-up period of one year applies to the shares that have become unconditional. In all cases, 60% of the award is paid out unconditionally (both the cash part and the non-cash part), whereas 40% is conditionally deferred for a period of four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on a reassessment of the five conditions mentioned for any award of regular variable remuneration. If this re-assessment leads to an adjustment of the deferred remuneration, the hold and/or claw-back system applies.\n\n## Remuneration policy governance\n\nThe Management Board sets the remuneration policy for employees, based on the advice of the Human Resource Management, Finance, Reporting & Control, Risk Management and Compliance departments. These, together with the Internal Audit department, have an important part to play in setting up, adjusting, implementing and reviewing our variable remuneration policy. They advise the Management and Supervisory Boards and report to them on their conclusions.\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for implementing the remuneration policy. The Supervisory Board approves the variable remuneration policy, including its general principles, and oversees its implementation. Approval by the Supervisory Board is also required for the variable remuneration pools, any significant 13 individual variable remuneration, and for individual variable remuneration proposed for employees designated as identified staff. The Supervisory Board's Remuneration Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's decision-making on remuneration and advises it in this area.\n\nMore information about the remuneration policy for identified staff can be found in our 2021 Pillar 3 disclosure, available via our website from 10 March 2022.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nThe key elements of corporate governance at Van Lanschot Kempen are set out below. The Articles of Association and various other regulations and documents relating to corporate governance can be found at\n\nvanlanschotkempen.com/en/governance and vanlanschotkempen.com/managementsupervision.\n\n## Corporate governance structure\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen NV is a listed public limited company under Dutch law, governed by a two-tier board. The Management Board is responsible for managing the company, while the Supervisory Board oversees the policies pursued by the Management Board, and the general conduct of affairs at the company and its associated business. The Supervisory Board advises the Management Board on the performance of its duties.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a structuurvennootschap . Under Dutch corporate law this means that in addition to the tasks already mentioned, the Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing and dismissing the Management Board and for approving some of its decisions. Both the Management Board and the Supervisory Board report to Van Lanschot Kempen's general meeting.\n\nOn 1 July 2021, the former listed company Van Lanschot Kempen NV was merged into Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV as the surviving company. At the same time, Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management changed its name to Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Management Board\n\nThe Management Board of Van Lanschot Kempen is responsible for the continuity of the company. It focuses on long-term value creation for the company and takes into account stakeholders' interests that are relevant in this context. The Management Board is responsible for the management of the company, and its duties include drawing up and achieving Van Lanschot Kempen's purpose, its strategy and related risk profile, its goals and the pattern of its results, while also attending to the environmental and social aspects of doing business that are relevant to the company.\n\nThe Supervisory Board notifies the general meeting of any proposed appointment of a member of the Management Board. Appointment of a member of the Management Board is subject to the approval of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). A member is appointed by the Supervisory Board. The maximum term for appointment or reappointment is four years. The Supervisory Board may dismiss a member of the Management Board at any time, but only after consulting the general meeting.\n\nIn strategic decisions, the Management Board takes all material environmental and social factors into account. Periodically, it determines the financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) for Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nIn performing its duties, the Supervisory Board focuses on the interests of the company and its associated business. The members of Van Lanschot Kempen's Supervisory Board are appointed by the general meeting, in accordance with the provisions set out in Article 23 of Van Lanschot Kempen's Articles of Association. Appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board is subject to the approval of DNB. Members of the Supervisory Board are appointed for a term of four years and may be reappointed for one further fouryear period. A member of the Supervisory Board may subsequently be reappointed again for a period of two years, and this appointment may be extended by another two years. In the event of reappointment after eight years, the reasons for reappointment should be given in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nA member of the Supervisory Board may only be dismissed by the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal with due observance of Article 161(2) of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In addition, the general meeting may pass a motion of no confidence in the Supervisory Board as a whole, in accordance with Article 161(a) of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Such a resolution results in the immediate dismissal of all members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Diversity policy\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's Supervisory Board has adopted a diversity policy for the composition of the Supervisory and Management Boards (the policy can be found at vanlanschotkempen.com/management-supervision under 'Diversity Policy Supervisory Board and Management Board', hereafter referred to as \"diversity policy\").\n\nOn 1 January 2022, the act to achieve a more balanced male/ female ratio on management and supervisory boards entered into force in the Netherlands. As a result of this new legislation, at least one-third of the members of the Supervisory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen must be female and one-third male. Furthermore, Van Lanschot Kempen must set appropriate and ambitious targets for gender diversity in the Management Board and for senior staff.\n\nIn response to this new legislation, we have adjusted our diversity policy. It contains the following features: We are committed to supporting, valuing and leveraging inclusion and diversity, and aim for a diverse composition of the Supervisory and Management Boards in the areas relevant to us, such as gender, nationality, background, experience, expertise and age. We apply the principle that, in cases where qualifications and skills are equal or of a similar level, the candidate with the more diverse profile will be selected.\n\nThe gender diversity of the Supervisory and Management Boards must be such that at least one-third of their members are women and at least one-third men. An action plan to reach the target for the female/male ratio on the Management Board will be drawn up in 2022.",

        "page_content": "We strive for a reasonable spread across ages and nationalities in the composition of the Supervisory and Management Boards, but we do not believe that age or nationality are suitable criteria for setting specific diversity targets so we do not set specific objectives for these. With regard to background, experience and expertise, we aim in keeping with the Supervisory Board's profile - to ensure that the combined background, experience and expertise of Supervisory Board members enable the Board as a collective to best carry out its range of responsibilities and duties towards Van Lanschot Kempen, taking into account the nature of our business and activities. The same applies to the Management Board. Our diversity policy describes the relevant areas of background, experience and expertise of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board respectively.\n\nIn implementing our diversity policy, the individual profiles drawn up for vacancies in the Supervisory and Management Boards take into account the policy's criteria and objectives. These profiles form the basis for the recruitment and selection of new members of the Supervisory and Management Boards. These criteria and objectives are also taken into account when evaluating the performance of the Supervisory and Management Boards. The results of our diversity policy are described in the section below on the Boards' composition and performance.\n\nThe policy governing recruitment and selection of members of the Management and Supervisory Boards can be found at vanlanschotkempen.com/management-supervision, under 'Policy Recruitment and Selection Van Lanschot Kempen'.\n\n## Composition and performance of the Management Board\n\nThe Management Board must consist of at least three members, with the actual number set by the Supervisory Board. The composition of the Management Board changed in 2021. On 27 May 2021, Erik van Houwelingen was appointed as a member of the Management Board, responsible for Investment Strategies & Solutions. With his appointment, the number of members of the Management Board increased from four to five. The Management Board consists of the Chair, Chief Financial & Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer, the member responsible for Client Management & Origination and the member responsible for Investment Strategies & Solutions. With the appointment of Erik van Houwelingen, all members of the Management Board were members of the Executive Board, and the Executive Board therefore ceased to exist.\n\nOn 1 October 2021, Karl Guha stepped down as member and Chair of the Management Board. He was succeeded by Maarten Edixhoven.\n\nThe Management Board evaluates its functioning as a whole and that of individual Board members at least once a year. The Supervisory Board discusses, at least once a year, the performance of the Management Board as a whole and members' performance individually. The Supervisory Board has concluded that the composition of the Management Board meets the objectives of our diversity policy in most respects. The composition of the Management Board is\n\ncomplementary and there is a sufficient degree of diversity with regard to background, expertise and experience.\n\nHowever, the target for at least one-third of the members of the Management Board to be women has not yet been met. During the recruitment and selection process for the new Chair of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board paid extra attention to possible female candidates. Despite this, after a careful and extensive recruitment process, Maarten Edixhoven was selected as the person with the best qualifications and skills for the position. As a result, currently all members of the Management Board are men.\n\nGender diversity still holds the attention of the Supervisory Board, and as such will continue to be an important element in the profile for future vacancies on the Management Board. In addition, if a vacancy in a senior position needs to be filled, specific attention is paid to female talent. As mentioned above, an action plan to reach the target for the female/male ratio on the Management Board will be drawn up in 2022.\n\n## Composition and performance of the Supervisory Board and its committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has a minimum of three members and a maximum of nine. Currently, the Supervisory Board comprises Frans Blom (Chair), Manfred Schepers (ViceChair), Karin Bergstein, Brigitte Boone, Bernadette Langius, Maarten Muller and Lex van Overmeire. After the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2021, Jeanine Helthuis stepped down as a member of the Supervisory Board. She was not available for reappointment as her second fouryear term expired that day. Brigitte Boone was appointed as a member of the Supervisory Board at the extraordinary general meeting held on 22 September 2021. Brigitte Boone filled the vacancy created by the resignation of Jeanine Helthuis.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has appointed four committees from among its members to prepare the Board's decisionmaking: the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Risk Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the Selection and Appointment Committee. These committees advise the Supervisory Board on matters relating to their respective areas of interest. More information about the committees and their composition can be found on page 77 of the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has drawn up a profile 1 for its size and composition, taking into account the nature and activities of the business associated with Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries, and the required expertise and background of the members of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board appraises its own performance, that of its committees and that of individual Supervisory Board members, at least once a year without members of the Management Board being present. The Supervisory Board appraises its own performance with independent support once every three years. One of the conclusions of the Supervisory Board's self-assessment is that the composition of the Board complies with the requirements set out in the Board's profile. More information about the conclusions of the Supervisory Board's self-assessment of their performance in 2021 can be found on page 81 of the Report of the Supervisory Board.",

        "page_content": "Diversity in general and gender diversity in particular are important factors in the recruitment and selection process for candidates for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board meets the objectives of our diversity policy, with its diverse composition in terms of gender, nationality, background, experience, expertise and age. This composition enables the Supervisory Board as a collective to carry out its responsibilities and duties effectively. The following areas of expertise are represented in the Supervisory Board: executive experience, strategy formulation and execution, banking and finance, clients and markets, audit, financial reporting, risk management, IT, digitalisation, transformation, sustainability (social and environmental), legal and compliance, and remuneration. The Supervisory Board currently has seven members, three of whom are female. This means that 42.9% of the positions on the Supervisory Board are held by women and the target for at least onethird of its members to be female/male, as included in the diversity policy, has been met.\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe revised Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016 2 (the Code) came into force starting in the 2017 financial year, and contains principles and best practice provisions that regulate relations between the management board, supervisory board and shareholders (including the general meeting). The Code aims to define responsibilities for long-term value creation, risk control, effective management and supervision, remuneration, and relationships with shareholders and other stakeholders. We fully complied with the Code in the 2021 reporting year.\n\n## Dutch Banking Code\n\nThe Dutch Banking Code 3 contains principles on sound and ethical business operations, governance, risk policy, audit and remuneration policy. The Banking Code applies to activities performed in, and aimed at, the Netherlands by banks with registered offices in the Netherlands and which hold a banking licence issued by DNB. It therefore applies to Van Lanschot Kempen because we hold a banking licence in the Netherlands.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen complied with the Banking Code in 2021. An explanation (in Dutch) of how Van Lanschot Kempen applied the Banking Code during the reporting year is provided on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en/ governance.\n\n## Capital structure and shares\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's authorised share capital consists of 150 million shares with a nominal value of \u20ac1 each, divided into 75 million Class A ordinary shares and 75 million Class C preference shares. Our outstanding capital consisted entirely of Class A ordinary shares at 31 December 2021; a total of 41,361,668 Class A ordinary shares had been issued. There were no outstanding Class C preference shares in 2021.\n\n## Depositary receipts for shares\n\nOver 99.99% of Class A ordinary shares in issue are held by Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen ('Stichting Administratiekantoor'), which has issued depositary receipts for these shares.\n\n- 2 The 2016 Dutch Corporate Governance Code can be downloaded from mccg.nl.\n\nThe receipts have been listed on the official market of the Euronext Amsterdam stock market since 1999. A depositary receipt can be converted into its underlying share without any restrictions, although administrative costs may be charged. Stichting Administratiekantoor fully complies with Principle 4.4 of the Code, which specifies that 'Depositary receipts for shares can be a means of preventing a majority (including a chance majority) of shareholders from controlling the decision-making process as a result of absenteeism at a general meeting. Depositary receipts for shares should not be issued as an anti-takeover protective measure.'\n\nStichting Administratiekantoor grants proxies so that holders of depositary receipts can always exercise their voting rights. In the case of shares for which Stichting Administratiekantoor has not granted proxies to the holders of depositary receipts and for which no voting instructions have been received, Stichting Administratiekantoor's Board decides how the votes are to be cast. Stichting Administratiekantoor exercises the voting rights in the interest of the holders of depositary receipts for shares, taking into account the interest of Van Lanschot Kempen, the enterprise associated therewith and all parties concerned. Its Board has three members and is independent of Van Lanschot Kempen. It appoints its own members, without requiring the approval of Van Lanschot Kempen. Before appointing a member, the Board allows the holders of depositary receipts for shares the opportunity to recommend candidates for appointment as members of the Board. A meeting of holders of depositary receipts takes place at least once every two years. At this meeting, the Board reports on its activities, vacancies in the Board, and candidates the Board intends to appoint as members of the Board. Once every two years, the Board requests the holders of depositary receipts at this meeting to confirm their confidence in the Board. At the meeting that was held on 16 November 2020, holders of depositary receipts confirmed this. The Board reports on its activities annually. This report can be found on page 257.\n\n## Stichting preferente aandelen C Van Lanschot Kempen\n\nA call option contract has been agreed between Stichting preferente aandelen C Van Lanschot Kempen ('Stichting preferente aandelen') and Van Lanschot Kempen, under which Stichting preferente aandelen was granted the right to acquire Class C preference shares up to 100% of the value of Van Lanschot Kempen's share capital in issue before the exercise of the call option, less one share. A general meeting, at which a proposal to redeem the preference shares will be placed on the agenda, is to be convened within 12 months.\n\nThe following circumstances may lead to the issuance of Class C preference shares:\n\n- -Merger talks that do not lead to an agreement;\n- -A concentration of shares or depositary receipts for shares in Van Lanschot Kempen as a result of purchases on the stock market or the purchase of blocks of shares, other than as a pure investment;\n- -The announcement of a public bid, whether or not in combination with the above circumstances;\n- -A proposal by a shareholder or holder of depositary receipts for shares to place an item on the agenda that represents a potential threat to Van Lanschot Kempen's continuity, identity and/or independence.",

        "page_content": "## Interests in Van Lanschot Kempen notifiable under Chapter 5.3 of the Financial Supervision Act\n\nPursuant to the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, shareholders and holders of depositary receipts of Van Lanschot Kempen are required to provide information on their holdings once they cross threshold levels of 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 95%. As of the publication date of this report, Van Lanschot Kempen is not aware of any shareholders or holders of depositary receipts with an interest of 3% or more in Van Lanschot Kempen other than Stichting Administratiekantoor, LDDM Holding BV, Romij BV, Janus Henderson Group plc, FMR LLC, NN Group NV and J.B. Meulman. For more information on Van Lanschot Kempen's shareholders, see the Van Lanschot Kempen shares section on page 71. Stichting preferente aandelen has reported a potential interest of 100% in Van Lanschot Kempen under the call option agreement between Stichting preferente aandelen and Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nIn 2021, no transactions took place between Van Lanschot Kempen and any natural person or legal entity holding at least 10% of the shares in Van Lanschot Kempen, and which would be material to Van Lanschot Kempen and/or the person/entity involved.\n\n## Rights of shareholders\n\nSince there are exclusively Class A ordinary shares in issue at present, this section only describes the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares and depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe portion of the profit remaining after addition to the reserves is at the disposal of the general meeting. In the event that a loss is incurred over a year, which cannot be covered by a reserve or by some other means, no profit distribution will occur in subsequent years until such time as this loss has been absorbed. A dividend on ordinary shares can only be paid out when the dividend proposal has been approved by the general meeting. Van Lanschot Kempen checks whether the proposed dividend satisfies the European Central Bank's recommendation on dividend payment policies. Further information on our dividend policy can be found on page 71.\n\n## Pre-emption rights\n\nWhen ordinary shares are issued, each existing holder of ordinary shares has a pre-emption right proportionate to the aggregate nominal amount of the existing holding of ordinary shares. Class A ordinary shares are issued to holders of Class A ordinary shares. The same applies to the grant of rights to acquire ordinary shares. Pre-emption rights can be limited or excluded by resolution of the Management Board, any such resolution being subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. The relevant authority of the Management Board ends as soon as its authority to issue shares expires (see 'Share issues').\n\nShareholders do not have any pre-emption rights on shares issued in exchange for a non-cash contribution. Nor do shareholders have any pre-emption rights on shares or depositary receipts for those shares issued to employees of Van Lanschot Kempen or another group company.\n\n## Special rights of shareholders\n\nThere are no special statutory control rights attached to shares in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen signed a shareholder agreement with LDDM Holding BV in 2011. In it, LDDM Holding affirms that it will respect Van Lanschot Kempen's independence. LDDM Holding will not cooperate with the acquisition by a third party of a shareholding in Van Lanschot Kempen exceeding 25% of the issued share capital without the approval of the Management and Supervisory Boards. In the event of any future share issues, Van Lanschot Kempen will give LDDM Holding the opportunity, subject to certain conditions, to keep its relative shareholding in Van Lanschot Kempen at the same level. As long as LDDM Holding retains an interest of at least 7.5% in Van Lanschot Kempen, it has the right to recommend one person for appointment as a member of the Supervisory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen. Maarten Muller currently serves on the Supervisory Board on LDDM Holding's recommendation.\n\n## Restrictions on voting rights and deadlines for exercising voting rights\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has not imposed any restrictions on the exercise of voting rights. In principle, voting rights are exercised at the general meeting by the shareholder or the person authorised by the shareholder to that end. A shareholder is entitled to vote at the general meeting if the shares in question are registered in the shareholder's name on the registration date (see 'General meeting'). Holders of depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares who register on time to attend the general meeting are granted a proxy by Stichting Administratiekantoor. They can use this proxy at the general meeting to exercise the voting rights on the shares held by Stichting Administratiekantoor, and in exchange for which depositary receipts were issued. Proxies will be provided when the depositary receipt holders sign the attendance list prior to the start of the meeting or, in the case of a virtual meeting, at the moment they log in to the designated platform to attend the virtual meeting. If the depositary receipt holder's right to attend the meeting is to be exercised by a representative authorised in writing, Stichting Administratiekantoor will grant a proxy to the representative. Shareholders and holders of depositary receipts for shares are also offered the opportunity to issue a voting instruction to an independent third party prior to the general meeting. The notice convening the relevant general meeting will state to whom this voting instruction should be sent and what the deadline is for submission.\n\n## Share issues\n\nThe extent of the Management Board's authority to decide on a share issue (subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board) is determined by a resolution of the general meeting. The duration and granting of this authority are also determined by resolution of the general meeting and may not exceed five years. The Management Board's authority to issue ordinary shares, including the granting of rights to acquire these shares, was extended at the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2021 for a period of 18 months from the date of that meeting. The authority to issue these shares is limited to 10% of the issued capital.",

        "page_content": "## Repurchase of shares\n\nRepurchases of paid-up shares in the company or depositary receipts for such shares, other than for no consideration, may take place if the general meeting has authorised the Management Board to this effect. This authorisation applies for up to a maximum of 18 months. Repurchase occurs pursuant to a decision by the Management Board, subject to Supervisory Board and DNB approval.\n\nThe Management Board was authorised at the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2021 to repurchase paidup ordinary shares in the company or depositary receipts for these shares, by buying such shares on the stock market or otherwise, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued capital at the date of authorisation, subject to Supervisory Board approval. This authority has been granted for a period of 18 months from the date of the meeting.\n\n## Transfer of shares and depositary receipts\n\nThe Articles of Association and the conditions of administration do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of Class A ordinary shares or depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares.\n\n## Amendment to the Articles of Association\n\nA resolution to amend the Articles of Association of Van Lanschot Kempen may only be adopted based on a proposal by the Management Board that has been approved by the Supervisory Board. If a proposal to amend the Articles of Association is presented to the general meeting, a copy of the proposal will be made available to the shareholders and holders of depositary receipts prior to the meeting.\n\n## General meeting\n\nEach voting shareholder and depositary receipt holder is authorised, either in person or through a representative authorised in writing, to attend the general meeting, to address the meeting and to exercise their voting rights. A registration date applies to each general meeting, which is the 28 th day prior to that meeting. The registration date determines who qualifies as a voting shareholder or depositary receipt holder for the relevant general meeting. The notice convening the meeting states the registration date, the way in which shareholders and depositary receipt holders can register and how they can exercise their rights, either in person or through a representative authorised in writing.\n\nShareholders and depositary receipt holders or their representatives are only admitted to the meeting if they have informed Van Lanschot Kempen in writing of their intention to attend, and if this has been done in the manner described in the notice convening the meeting. Access to the meeting is only possible if the relevant shares or depositary receipts are registered in the name of the shareholder or the depositary receipt holder on the registration date. Representatives must also present a written proxy. A written proxy may be sent electronically. Each share entitles the holder to cast one vote at the general meeting.\n\nThe powers of the general meeting include the following:\n\n- -Appointing members of the Supervisory Board on the Supervisory Board's recommendation;\n- -Approving decisions of the Management Board to make important changes to the identity or nature of the company or the business;\n\n- -Setting the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board;\n- -Setting the remuneration policy for the Management Board;\n- -Passing a motion of no confidence in the Supervisory Board;\n- -Approving schemes in the form of shares and/or rights to acquire shares for the Management Board;\n- -Disposing of the profit remaining after dividend has been distributed to any outstanding Class C preference shares, and after the decision has been made to add all or part of the profit to the reserves;\n- -Adopting the financial statements;\n- -Discharging the Management Board;\n- -Granting the Management Board the authority to issue shares and to limit or exclude pre-emption rights on the issue of shares;\n- -Discharging the Supervisory Board;\n- -Granting the Management Board the authority to repurchase the company's own shares;\n- -Resolving to amend the Articles of Association of Van Lanschot Kempen, to dissolve Van Lanschot Kempen, or to effect a legal merger or demerger of Van Lanschot Kempen, following a proposal to that effect by the Management Board which has been approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition, the general meeting has an advisory vote with regard to the remuneration report.\n\n## Main features of Van Lanschot Kempen's management and control system\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's management and control system is designed to manage internal and external risks. This includes the management of financial reporting risks, to ensure reliable financial reporting and financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and which comply with the prevailing legislation and regulations.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen applies the three lines of defence model for the management of risk. The first line of defence is the business, responsible for day-to-day risk management. The second line of defence is provided by departments such as Risk Management and Compliance, which oversee the first line. The Internal Audit department acts as the third line of defence, providing an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the internal management and control systems. The three lines of defence model provides the Management Board with a reasonable degree of certainty as to how the internal management and control system is functioning, including the efficacy of both the first and second lines.\n\nThe Internal Audit department is responsible for carrying out IT and operational audits. All of its reports are submitted to (members of) the Management Board. Internal Audit, Compliance and Risk Management ensure adequate followup and prioritisation. Supplementary control measures have been defined in the meantime, which should mitigate risk sufficiently.\n\nThe effectiveness of the risk & control framework is evaluated annually by the Risk Management and Compliance departments, while the Internal Audit department also assesses its quality and effectiveness. The results of these evaluations feature in these departments' quarterly reports.",

The financial statements also include a more detailed explanation of risk management at Van Lanschot Kempen (see 'Risk management', beginning on page 126).\n\n## Financial reporting risk\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for the design and operation of an adequate system of internal control for Van Lanschot Kempen's financial reporting. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial reporting. The financial statements must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legislation and regulations.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has tools in place to manage financial reporting risks:\n\n- -A risk & control framework describing processes and procedures, and setting out primary controls such as authorisations and segregation of duties;\n- -Periodic management reports and KPI dashboards, accompanied by analysis of financial and non-financial figures and trends;\n- -Evaluation of the functioning of the internal management and control system by the Internal Audit department. The main findings are discussed with the Management Board, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n- -The Accounting Manual, which sets out the principles regarding financial accounting.\n- -Assessment and approval of the annual report by the Management Board, and discussion of the annual report by the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n\nIn-control statements are provided by the management of the relevant departments. These are based on the results of testing procedures for the risk & control framework, the risks reported on a quarterly basis, the follow-up of these risks, and the incidents reported. Risk Management and Compliance evaluated the 2021 in-control statements.\n\nSetting out its main findings, the Internal Audit department's quarterly reports were discussed with the Management Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee. The conclusions of the Audit and Compliance Committee were subsequently shared with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was informed about the Management Board's internal control of the organisation, and how it safeguards the integrity of financial information. The subjects considered by the Supervisory Board when assessing the financial statements include the board report and the audit by the external auditors.\n\nThe key audit findings and other observations cited in the independent auditors' report were discussed with the Management Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee, and formed part of the organisation's management and control. The non-financial information is subject to internal controls and reviews, whereas the sustainability reporting is drawn up in accordance with GRI reporting standards and SFDR requirements, and is also subject to a limited assurance engagement performed by the independent external auditors.\n\n## Statement by the Management Board\n\n- -The management report provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems;\n\nIn accordance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Management Board states that:\n\n- -The aforementioned systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies;\n- -The management report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to expectation of the company's continuity for the period of 12 months after the preparation of this report;\n- -Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a 'going concern' basis;\n- -Based on the analysis of in-control statements and the quarterly reports from Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit, it is justified to state that the financial statements are free of any material misstatements caused by fraud.\n\n## External auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV (PwC) were reappointed as Van Lanschot Kempen's external auditors for the 2022 financial year at the annual general meeting on 27 May 2021. PwC's audit plan for 2021 and risk analysis were discussed in June 2021 at meetings of the Management Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nPwC issued a board report for 2021 in February 2022. The subjects set out in this board report are in line with the notes included in this annual report with respect to risk management, insofar as these relate to financial reporting risks. The external auditors may be questioned at the annual general meeting in relation to their audit, and will be attending the meeting for this reason. The Management Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee evaluated the functioning of PwC in January 2022.\n\n## STATEMENT BY THE MANAGEMENT BOARD\n\nAs required by Article 5:25c (2c) of the Financial Supervision Act, each of the undersigned hereby confirms that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- -The 2021 Report of the Management Board of Van Lanschot Kempen gives a true and fair view of the position of the company and its consolidated entities on balance sheet date, and of the course of their affairs during the 2021 financial year, and describes the material risks that Van Lanschot Kempen faces.\n- -The 2021 financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of Van Lanschot Kempen and its consolidated entities;\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 23 February 2022\n\n## Management Board\n\nMaarten Edixhoven, Chair Constant Korthout Arjan Huisman Richard Bruens Erik van Houwelingen",

We had paid out a small portion of the 2020 dividend in June 2021. 2019 and 2020 dividends totalled  \u20ac59.2 million and \u20ac28.6 million respectively.\n\nDuring 2021, the composition of Van Lanschot Kempen's equity changed due to the legal merger (see \"Summary of significant accounting principles\").

        "page_content": "## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\n## General\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen NV (Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV until 30 June 2021) is an independent wealth manager specialising in the preservation and creation of wealth, in a sustainable way, for both its clients and the society of which it is part. On 1 July 2021, the legal merger between Van Lanschot Kempen NV and Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV became effective. As a result of this merger, Van Lanschot Kempen NV ceased to exist as a legal entity and Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV acquired the assets and liabilities of Van Lanschot Kempen NV under universal title of succession. In addition, the statutory name of Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV changed to Van Lanschot Kempen NV as of 1 July 2021.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen NV (\"Van Lanschot Kempen\") has its registered office at Hooge Steenweg 29, 5211 JN 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. Van Lanschot Kempen is a public limited company incorporated under Dutch law and registered under number 16038212 at the Chamber of Commerce. Depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares are publicly traded on the Euronext markets.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen at 31 December 2021 were prepared by the Management Board and approved by the Supervisory Board on 23 February 2022, and will be submitted to the annual general meeting of shareholders for adoption on 25 May 2022.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and with Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Unless stated otherwise, assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost.\n\n## Continuity\n\nThe Management Board has examined the ability of Van Lanschot Kempen to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future and concluded that we are able to do so. Moreover, the Management Board is not aware of any material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on this basis.\n\n## Economic context and Covid-19\n\nThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic for Van Lanschot Kempen is considered to be limited. During the pandemic we have not experienced major disquiet among our clients, and instead observed a net inflow in assets under management (AuM) in the Private Clients segment, from both existing and new clients.\n\nIf our clients run into financial difficulties, this can lead to higher credit losses. In 2021, Covid-19's impact on our credit portfolio was minor, even after application of a risk management overlay. This is captured in the decrease in expected credit loss (ECL) during 2021. The risk\n\nmanagement overlay takes into account uncertainties at specific clients and in specific industries which are not (yet) reflected in the model parameters. For more information, see \"Risk management\", under 3.8, Loss allowance for expected credit loss (including sensitivity analyses performed by us).\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has a solid capital and liquidity position. Our capital and liquidity are above our targets and our net result in 2021 amounted to \u20ac143.8 million, significantly above the figure for 2020 (\u20ac49.8 million).\n\nThe partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden announced in 2021 will further strengthen our position in the wealth management market in Belgium. This partnership fits perfectly into the strategy of becoming a real challenger in this country.\n\nTo summarise, Van Lanschot Kempen is well able to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic thanks to its solid capital and liquidity position, and strong financial performance. Considering the above, we can affirm that the continuity of the company is not under pressure and that there are no indications that cast significant doubt over Van Lanschot Kempen's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Functional and reporting currency\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are denominated in euros, Van Lanschot Kempen's functional and reporting currency. Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are presented in thousands of euros. The totals may not always match the sum of the individual values due to rounding.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 remain unchanged, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective from 1 January 2021.\n\n## Changes in published IFRS standards and interpretations\n\nThe IFRS standards listed below became effective from 1 January 2021 and have been applied to our financial statements for 2021. Unless stated otherwise, application of these standards had no impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's equity or result. Application of the amended standards generally entails amendment or expansion of notes.\n\n## IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2\n\nThe amendments provide temporary reliefs that enable hedge accounting to continue during the period of uncertainty before the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative nearly risk-free interest rate. We have chosen to apply hedge accounting for micro fair value hedges based on IFRS 9 from 1 January 2022 onwards and the hedge documentation has been adjusted accordingly. The amendments do not materially impact group results. The primary change compared with IAS 39 is that the hedge effectiveness assessment is done only",

        "page_content": "prospectively instead of retrospectively. Hedge effectiveness will be assessed based on our risk management policy and the nature of the risk exposure, using different scenarios. If possible, changes will be made to  further improve the effectiveness of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Published IFRS standards and interpretations not yet effective\n\nIn addition to the IFRS standards and interpretations referred to above, a number of IFRS standards and interpretations are new or have been amended, and apply to financial statements for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. We have not applied the following standards in the 2021 financial statements. Unless stated otherwise, standards will be applied as soon as they become effective and have been endorsed by the EU.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework\n\nThe amendments are intended to update a reference to the Conceptual Framework without significantly changing the requirements of IFRS 3. The amendments add an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 that requires entities to apply the criteria in IAS 37 or IFRIC 21, respectively, instead of the Conceptual Framework, to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date. At the same time, the amendments add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date. The amendments must be applied prospectively. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on group results.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use - Amendments to IAS 16\n\nThe amendments prohibit entities from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognises the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, in profit or loss.\n\nThe amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and must be applied retrospectively to items of property, plant and equipment made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented in which the entity first applies the amendment. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on group results.\n\n## Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract Amendments to IAS 37\n\nThe amendments specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a 'directly related cost approach'. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on group results.\n\n## Annual Improvements to 2018-20 Cycle\n\nChanges to standards concern:\n\n## IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards - Subsidiary as a First-time Adopter\n\nThe amendment permits a subsidiary that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1 to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported in the parent's consolidated financial statements, based on the parent's date of transition to IFRS, if no adjustments have been made for consolidation procedures and for the effects of the business combination in which the parent acquired the subsidiary. This amendment is also applicable  to an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1. An entity applies the amendment for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Earlier application is permitted. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on group results.\n\n## IFRS 9 Financial Instruments - Fees in the \"10 per cent\" Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities\n\nThe amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf. An entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment. An entity applies the amendment for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Earlier application is permitted. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on group results.\n\n## Significant accounting judgements and estimates\n\nWe have identified those accounting policies which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. In the process of applying these accounting policies, we use estimates, assumptions and judgements which can have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on the most recent information available, and the actual amounts may differ in the future. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the determination of significant influence, fair value of financial instruments, acquisitions, impairments of financial assets, goodwill and intangible assets.\n\nThese estimates and assumptions are based on the most recent information available and include the impact of Covid-19. The actual amounts may differ in the future. Where applicable, the impact of Covid-19 on assumptions used are explained further in the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Determination of significant influence\n\nWe have applied critical judgement to determine significant influence in companies in which we hold minority interests smaller than 20%. Our influence on the financial and operating policy decisions at some minority interests is more in line with that in an associate, e.g. veto rights in decisions on the issuance of new shares and decisions on amendments to the Articles of Association. For that reason, we classify these as minority interests and apply equity accounting instead of IFRS 9 fair value accounting. For further information, see the disclosure on Investments in associates using the equity method.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe determination of the fair value of financial instruments, in so far as available and provided there is an active market, is based on stock market prices at the reporting date. For financial assets, the bid price is used; for financial liabilities, the ask price.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market is determined on the basis of cash flow and of option and other valuation models. These models are based on the market circumstances prevailing at the reporting date.\n\nEstimates mainly relate to future cash flows and discount rates. For more details, see 'Risk management', under 14, Fair value.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn the case of acquisitions, it is necessary to determine the fair value of the acquired assets (including any intangible assets and goodwill acquired), as well as of liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position. Estimates are used for this, particularly for those items not traded on an active market. Management consideration is also needed to determine the moment of the change of control and thus the moment of consolidation of an acquired entity.\n\n## Impairments of financial assets\n\nWe recognise a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, as well as for financial guarantees and loan commitments. When there has been no significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL is recognised based on a 12-month expected credit loss (Stage 1). When a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, ECL is recognised based on a lifetime expected credit loss (Stage 2). For impaired loans (Stage 3), a lifetime ECL is recognised. The impairments of financial assets are determined as a critical estimate. For more information on deterioration in credit risk, see 'Risk management', under 3.8, Loss allowance for expected credit loss.\n\n## Impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nTo measure the recoverable amounts, we calculate the value in use for each cash-generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs. This calculation reflects an estimate of future cash flows, base-case scenario analysis and discount rates. Future cash flow estimates are based on our strategic plans and different types of investigation into possible trends. Events and factors that could have a significant impact on these estimates include market expectations, effects of mergers and acquisitions, competitive conditions, client\n\nbehaviour and changes in client relationships, cost structure, trends in interest rates and risks, and other circumstances specific to the industry and sector. In addition, an annual test is carried out for indications of impairment of other intangible assets with a finite useful life. For more information on the discount rates used, see Note 11, Goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n## Other accounting estimates\n\n## Impairments of non-financial assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and its value in use. This fair value less costs to sell is the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid on the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the valuation date. To determine whether assets are impaired, the individual assets are allocated to the lowest level at which cash flows can be identified (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that have been subject to impairment, other than goodwill paid, are reviewed annually to determine whether the impairment can be reversed. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill paid, are tested for impairment annually by assessing whether there are any indications that these assets are impaired.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset. Estimates are used when determining future taxable profits, since these are subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions of provisions\n\nPension liabilities are determined using actuarial calculations. These calculations use assumptions regarding elements such as the discount rate, future trends in salaries and returns on investments. These assumptions are subject to estimation uncertainty. See Note 19, Provisions.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions are determined on the basis of the most recent estimates of the expected costs. The timing of the cash outflow related to these provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability of the outcome and time required to conclude these claims. In determining these provisions, where applicable, we take into consideration the opinion of legal experts.",

        "page_content": "## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen comprise the financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries. These have been prepared at 31 December 2021 using accounting policies consistent with those used in the previous year, and their financial year is concurrent with the calendar year.\n\nSubsidiaries (including the consolidated structured entities) are associates in which Van Lanschot Kempen exercises decisive control. Van Lanschot Kempen has decisive control over an entity when it has power over that entity and is exposed to or has rights to variable income from its involvement in the entity and is able to use its power over the entity to influence the entity's income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot Kempen and the entity. Factors taken into account include existing and potential voting rights. A right is a material right if its holder is able to exercise that right in practice.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has power over an entity if its existing and potential voting rights amount to more than 50%. If these rights amount to less than 50%, Van Lanschot Kempen determines whether it has power over the entity pursuant to contractual agreements. In making this assessment, a distinction is made between substantive and protective rights. Substantive rights are rights which enable the decision-making power of an enterprise to be influenced directly and which give Van Lanschot Kempen decisive control over an entity. Examples include the right to appoint and dismiss members of the board of management, and to set the level of their remuneration. Protective rights are rights which protect the interests of an entity in another entity, but which do not directly confer decision-making powers. Protective rights do not give Van Lanschot Kempen decisive control over an entity. When acquiring noncontrolling interests, Van Lanschot Kempen in principle includes only protective rights in the contractual agreement. These are rights of approval which enable Van Lanschot Kempen to protect its minority position without acquiring decision-making power. Examples of protective rights are rights of approval in respect of the issue of shares and effecting significant acquisitions.\n\nIntra-group transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of incorporation or acquisition, being the date on which Van Lanschot Kempen acquires control, and are consolidated until the date that such control ceases.\n\nWe consolidate interests in investment funds if we have power over the investment fund and are exposed to or have rights to variable income stemming from our involvement and are able to use our power over the investment fund to influence the variable income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot Kempen and the investment fund. Van Lanschot Kempen takes into account its interest for its own account and its own role, or that of one of its group companies, as fund manager.\n\nIn the case of subsidiaries not fully controlled by Van Lanschot Kempen, the non-controlling interest in equity is presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position as a component of total equity. The profit or loss for the reporting period that can be attributed to the non-controlling interest is disclosed separately.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nAcquisitions are recognised using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets (inclusive of any intangible assets not previously recognised in the statement of financial position), liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position.\n\nGoodwill, being the difference between the cost of the acquisition (including assumed debts) and our interest in the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position at the acquisition date, is capitalised as an intangible asset. If this difference is negative (negative goodwill), it is taken directly to the statement of income. Goodwill is not amortised. For more information on its valuation, see Note 11, Goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nA non-controlling interest in the company acquired is recognised at the fair value prevailing on the acquisition date or at the proportionate share in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the company acquired. Results of companies acquired are disclosed in the statement of income from the date at which control is obtained.\n\nAdjustments to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities at the acquisition date which are identified within 12 months of the acquisition may lead to adjustment of goodwill. Adjustments identified after expiry of one year are disclosed in the statement of income.\n\nOn disposal of group companies, the difference between the sale proceeds and the acquisition cost (including goodwill) is included in the statement of income together with any unrealised gain or loss.\n\n## Mercier Vanderlinden\n\nOn 7 April 2021, Van Lanschot Kempen and Mercier Vanderlinden Asset Management (\"Mercier Vanderlinden\") announced agreement on a partnership between Van Lanschot Kempen and Mercier Vanderlinden.\n\nThe transaction was effected by the transfer of 70% of the shares of Mercier Vanderlinden to Van Lanschot Kempen. Commitment was made to acquire the remaining 30% in two separate tranches in the first quarters of 2025 and 2026. Effective July 2021, Mercier Vanderlinden has been 100% consolidated with the recognition of a deferred contingent liability for the remaining shares.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\n## Functional currency\n\nItems in the statement of financial position pertaining to each group company are stated in the currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates (i.e. the functional currency).\n\n## Group companies\n\n- -Assets and liabilities are translated using the closing exchange rate at the reporting date;\n\nThe assets, liabilities, income and expenses of group companies that use a functional currency other than the reporting currency are translated as follows:\n\n- -Income and expenses are translated using the rate prevailing on the transaction date;\n- -Remaining exchange-related gains or losses are recognised as a separate component of equity.\n\nUpon consolidation, exchange-related gains or losses arising from monetary items forming part of a net investment in foreign divisions are recognised in equity. Exchange-related gains or losses on borrowings and other items designated as hedging instruments for such investments are also recognised in equity.\n\n## Transactions and line items\n\nOn initial recognition, transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Translation differences arising on the settlement of such transactions or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of income, except where they are recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges in foreign divisions.\n\nIn general, translation differences in the statement of income\n\nare included in the result on financial transactions. Translation differences on non-monetary items measured at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Non-monetary items are translated into the reporting currency at the same time as the determination of their fair value. By translation on the reporting date, currency translation differences on non-monetary items measured at fair value through equity are included in the revaluation reserve in equity.\n\nNon-monetary items not measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the original transaction date.\n\n## Recognition of financial assets in the statement of financial position\n\nPurchases of financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss whose value is subject to change, or financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, or other financial assets at amortised costs, which are settled according to standard market conventions, are recognised on the transaction date, i.e. the date on which we undertake to purchase or sell the asset concerned. Loans and advances are recognised on the settlement date, i.e. the date on which we receive the asset.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position\n\n- -Our rights to the cash flows from the asset expire;\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when:\n\n- -We have retained the right to receive the cash flows from an asset, but have an obligation to pay these in full to a third party under a special agreement;\n- -We have not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards but have transferred control over the asset.\n- -We have transferred our rights to the cash flows from the asset and have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards;\n\nIf we have transferred our rights to the cash flows from an asset, but have not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset and have not transferred control, the asset is recognised as long as we have continuing involvement in the asset.\n\nA financial liability is derecognised as soon as the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## Repo transactions and reverse repo transactions\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos) continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position. The related liability is included under the relevant line item (Due to banks).\n\nSecurities purchased subject to resale agreements (reverse repos) are recognised under the line item Due from banks or under Loans and advances to the public and private sectors. The difference between the sale price and the purchase price is recognised in the statement of income as interest during the term of the agreement.\n\n## Special purpose entities\n\nWe have placed parts of our loan portfolio in special purpose entities (SPEs), which comprise only covered bond companies. If we have effective control over an SPE, it is consolidated. We have control over an entity when we have power over that entity and are exposed to or have rights to variable income from our involvement in the entity and are able to use our power over the entity to influence the entity's income.\n\nThe accounting principles followed by Van Lanschot Kempen are applied when consolidating SPEs.",

        "page_content": "## Transfers of financial assets\n\n- -The contractual rights to receive the cash flows from that financial asset are transferred; or\n\nAll or a part of a financial asset is transferred if:\n\n- -The contractual rights to receive the cash flows from that financial asset are retained, but a contractual obligation is assumed to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients under an arrangement.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nA derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the effective date of the contract. After initial recognition, the derivative is subsequently remeasured at fair value and movements in value are taken to the statement of income under Result on financial transactions. Fair values are based on stock exchange prices, cash flow models, or option and other valuation models.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWe use derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge our exposure to risks. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities which are hedged through fair value hedging and which would otherwise be recognised at cost is adjusted for movements in the fair value that can be attributed to the hedged risks. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives not relating to the hedged risks are taken directly to the statement of income. During 2021, we made the necessary preparations to change the hedge accounting method for micro fair value hedges to IFRS 9. We have chosen to apply hedge accounting for micro fair value hedges based on IFRS 9 from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n\nAt the inception of a hedge transaction, we formally designate and document the hedge relationship and the financial risk management objective when entering into the hedge transaction. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how we will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to risks.\n\nSuch hedges are considered to be effective if we may expect, both upon inception and during the term of the hedge, that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument, in so far as they relate to the hedged risk, and the actual outcome is within a range of 80-125%. The effectiveness is assessed and documented on a monthly basis in order to determine that the hedge has been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it was intended. We apply the EU carve-out on portfolio fair value hedges.\n\nHedges that qualify for hedge accounting are recognised as follows:\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability arising as a result of interest rate changes. Movements in the value of the hedging instrument are taken to the statement of income.\n\nAny change in the fair value of the hedged item is also recognised in the statement of income, in so far as the hedging instrument has been effective in the preceding period.\n\nA hedge relationship ends if the hedging instrument is sold, expires or is exercised, or if the hedging transaction no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, with the remaining value adjustment of the hedged item amortised through profit or loss until the end of its term.\n\nWe apply micro fair value hedge accounting and macro fair value hedge accounting.\n\n## Micro fair value hedges\n\nA fair value hedge is classified as a micro fair value hedge when the hedged item (or group of items) is a distinctively identifiable asset or liability hedged by one or a few hedging instruments. Debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income and issued debt securities are hedged for interest rate risk in a micro fair value hedge.\n\n## Macro fair value hedges\n\nWe apply macro fair value hedges for fixed rate mortgages. A portfolio of mortgages is identified comprising homogeneous loans based on their contractual interest rates, maturity and other risk characteristics. Mortgages within the identified portfolio are allocated into repricing term buckets based on expected repricing dates rather than contractual repricing dates. The hedging instruments are designated appropriately to those repricing term buckets.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are hedges of the exposure to fluctuations in the cash flow of an asset, liability or future transaction arising as a result of interest rate changes and/ or inflation. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity until the hedged item affects the statement of income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the statement of income.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, or if it can no longer be designated as a hedge, accumulated gains and losses remain in equity until the expected future transaction is taken to the statement of income. If the expected future transaction is no longer likely to take place, the accumulated result is transferred directly from equity to the statement of income.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nIf the hybrid contract contains a host that is not an asset, the embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and treated as separate derivatives when:\n\n- -A separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative; and\n- -The economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract;\n- -The hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "## Day 1 profit\n\nDiscrepancies between the transaction price and the fair value may arise if valuation techniques are applied at the time of the transaction. Such a discrepancy is referred to as a Day 1 profit. Any resulting profit or loss is recognised directly in the statement of income if the valuation method is based on observable inputs in an active market. In the event of unobservable inputs, the gain or loss is amortised over the term of the transaction.\n\n## Netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are netted and presented in the consolidated financial statements at the net amount when we have a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. See 3.7, Risk management.\n\n## Statement of financial position\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks\n\nCash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks comprise, at nominal value, cash in hand and deposits with a term of less than three months, investments readily convertible into a known amount of cash with an insignificant risk of value changes, balances at central banks and balances withdrawable on demand at other banks in respect of which the risk of value changes is insignificant. The amount due from De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) arising from the minimum reserve requirement is also included in this item.\n\n## Financial assets from trading activities\n\nFinancial assets from trading activities are transactions for our own account whereby the aim is to actively sell these instruments in the short term. Financial assets from trading activities consist of the trading portfolio of both equity instruments and debt instruments. The financial assets from trading activities are recognised at fair value with effect from the trade date and value adjustments are taken to the statement of income under the line item Result on financial transactions.\n\n## Due from banks\n\nAmounts due from banks are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are carried at fair value. The positive and negative values of derivatives are shown separately on the face of the statement of financial position on the assets side and the liabilities side, respectively. The values of derivatives with a positive and negative value, concluded with the same counterparty, are only netted if the cash flows are settled on a net basis and this is permitted under law. Movements in the value of derivatives are taken directly to the line item Result on financial transactions. If the hedge is completely effective, the net impact on the statement of income is nil. The difference, in so far as this remains within the ranges set, reflects ineffectiveness and is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Derivatives include:\n\n- -Economic hedges Economic hedges are derivatives used to manage risks\n\n- -The fair value of derivatives held for trading Derivatives held for trading are transactions for own account whereby the aim is to actively sell them in the short term;\n- without applying hedge accounting;\n- Structured product derivatives are instruments to hedge structured products sold to clients, without application\n- -Client option positions Offsetting market transactions are conducted for all option positions held by our clients on a one-on-one basis;\n- -Structured product derivatives of hedge accounting;\n- -Derivatives with application of hedge accounting These are derivatives used as hedging instruments in the application of hedge accounting.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Additionally, any instrument for which the contractual cash flow characteristics are not solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) are measured at FVPL. No restrictions are set for sales within the fair value through profit or loss portfolio. Interest earned on these assets is recognised as interest income. All other realised and unrealised gains and losses on remeasuring debt instruments at fair value are recognised under Result on financial transactions. All realised and unrealised gains and losses on remeasuring equity instruments at fair value are recognised under Income from securities and associates.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nA debt instrument that is held within the hold to collect and sell business model and meets the SPPI test is measured at fair value, with fair value adjustments recognised in Other comprehensive income unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss. Sales as a result of managing everyday liquidity needs, maintaining a particular interest yield profile on the secondary market, or to match the duration and sales required by regulators, are consistent with the objective of the hold to collect and sell portfolio.\n\nUnder FVOCI, a financial asset is measured at its fair value and movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument's amortised cost which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in Result on financial transactions. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## Loans and advances to the public and private sectors\n\nLoans and advances to the public and private sectors are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, and are subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method less any allowance for impairment. The impairment is recognised in the statement of income.\n\n## Other financial assets at amortised cost\n\nA debt instrument that is held within the hold to collect business model and meets the SPPI test is measured at amortised cost unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss. Under this measurement category, the financial asset is initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, and subsequently recognised at amortised cost less the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and adjusted for any impairment allowance. The impairment is recognised in the statement of income. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Investments in associates using the equity method\n\nThese investments have been designated by management as transactions held indefinitely, and as a result of the acquired control can be classified as investments in associates using the equity method. These are investments in entities where we have significant influence but not control. If there is a change in the equity of the associate, we recognise our share in this change and include it in the statement of changes in equity. This also applies to results of associates recognised in our statement of income.\n\nIn the first year of investment, investments classified as investments in associates using the equity method are recognised at cost, and where applicable are adjusted for any changes in the value of the associate's individual receivables and payables occurring after the acquisition, measured using the policies applied by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the investments in associates using the equity method is determined each quarter. The valuation methods applied are the capitalisation method (peer group analysis), the discounted cash flow method and the disclosed net asset value method. An impairment is recognised if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nThe capitalisation method determines the value of a business by multiplying the operating profit (EBIT) and the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by a multiplier factor derived from similar listed companies (the peer group), if applicable also taking account of a discount for poor liquidity and minority shareholding. EBIT and EBITDA are adjusted for one-off items where applicable.\n\nThe discounted cash flow method calculates the enterprise value by discounting the forecast operational cash flows at a discount rate for the planning period and a final value based on the extrapolation of the operating profit.\n\nThe discount rate is determined on the basis of the discount rate of listed companies with a high degree of similarity and on the specific characteristics of the company. If applicable, the discounted cash flow method takes account of a discount for poor liquidity and minority shareholdings.\n\nThe company's net debt is then deducted from the value resulting from the capitalisation method and/or discounted cash flow method and multiplied by the share in the capital structure in order to derive the shareholder value from the enterprise value.\n\nThe disclosed net asset value method determines the value of a company based on the statement of financial position.\n\nIf our share in the associate's losses is equal to or exceeds our interest in the associate, no further losses are recognised unless we have assumed obligations or made payments for these associates.\n\n## Property and equipment\n\nProperty and equipment comprise property, information technology, furniture and fixtures, and communication and safety equipment. Property and equipment are initially carried at cost and subsequently measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairments. The carrying value includes the costs for replacement of part of the existing property as soon as these costs are incurred, but excludes day-to-day servicing costs. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset.\n\nLease contracts which we entered into as a lessee are classified as right-of-use assets. Right-of-use assets are presented as part of Property and equipment in the statement of financial position and are measured at cost, comprising the following:\n\n- -Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- -The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;\n- -Any initial direct costs;\n\nDepreciation is applied using the same method as for wholly-owned tangible assets.\n\n- -Restoration costs.\n\nThe recoverable amount of individual property items within\n\nthe different CGUs or group of CGUs is determined every year, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, and more often if market conditions so dictate. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is set by an independent surveyor. If the fair value less costs to sell is below the carrying amount, the value in use is determined. This value is calculated using the value-inuse method. If the value in use is also below the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised for the difference between the carrying amount and the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.",

Our policy is focused on selling these assets in due course. Property not in own use is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairments. This property is considered to be impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount less the relevant variable costs to sell is based on the appraisal value as determined by an independent surveyor.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the acquired assets (including intangible assets) and liabilities, and the purchase price paid (excluding acquisition costs). Goodwill paid is included in the financial statements at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill paid is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. An impairment is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill relates. A CGU's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\n\nOwing to the absence of a market for separate CGUs, we are unable to calculate a reliable fair value less costs for which each CGU or group of CGUs may be sold. The recoverable amount is therefore deemed to be equal to the value in use. The value in use is determined by discounting the future equity cash flows generated by each CGU or group of CGUs to their net present value using a cost of equity for each CGU or group of CGUs. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The impairment is first applied in full to the goodwill and then pro rata to the individual assets.\n\nOther intangible assets with a finite useful life, such as application software, client relationships, contractual rights and the value of acquired funds and loans and advances, are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives.\n\n|                                   | Estimated useful life of intangible assets (years)   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Client relationships              | 5-20                                                 |\n| Third-party distribution channels | 12-20                                                |\n| Brand names                       | 5-20                                                 |\n| Application software              | 3-5                                                  |\n\n## Tax assets and liabilities\n\nTax assets and liabilities are stated at face value. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to the same tax authority, the same type of tax and the law permits offsetting of these assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised on the face of the statement of financial position if the valuation of an asset or liability temporarily differs from the valuation for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates prevailing on the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if they relate to the same tax authority, concern the same type of tax, if it is permitted under law to offset these deferrals and if the deferrals are expected to be settled simultaneously. Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are assessed at every reporting date and reduced to the extent necessary. This reduction will be reversed if it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.\n\nChanges in the value of investments classified as available for sale and movements in the value of derivatives forming part of a cash flow hedge are recognised in equity net of deferred tax. Deferred tax assets and liabilities cease to be recognised when these movements in value are realised. Current tax is taken to the statement of income on realisation of the movement in value.\n\n## Other assets\n\nAssets acquired through foreclosures are carried at the lower of cost or the recoverable amount. This recoverable amount is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the relevant variable costs to sell. The recoverable amount less the relevant variable costs to sell is based on the appraisal value as determined by an independent surveyor. Other assets are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Financial liabilities from trading activities\n\nFinancial liabilities from trading activities are transactions for own account whereby the aim is to repurchase these instruments in the short term. These instruments are stated at fair value, with movements in value recognised in the statement of income under Result on financial transactions. This line item comprises short positions on the trading portfolio in both equity instruments and debt instruments. Recognition is from the date on which the contract is concluded.",

        "page_content": "## Due to banks\n\nAmounts due to banks are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Public and private sector liabilities\n\nPublic and private sector liabilities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\n- -Designation eliminates or significantly reduces inconsistencies in measurement and recognition which would otherwise arise as a result of liabilities being valued or income and expenses being recognised under different accounting policies; or\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss comprise financial instruments which management believes should be recognised at fair value through profit or loss based on one of the following reasons:\n\n- -The contract in which the financial instrument is included contains one or more embedded derivatives and the entire contract is recognised at fair value through profit or loss. This is only permitted if the embedded derivative has significant influence on the contractually agreed cash flows.\n\nThe valuation takes account of our own credit risk. Own credit risk is recognised in equity under the line item Own credit risk reserve. The remaining amount of change in the fair value is recognised in Result on financial transactions.\n\n## Issued debt securities\n\nIssued debt securities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, issued debt securities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Repurchase of our own debt securities is offset in the consolidated financial statements against the liability; the difference between the cost and the carrying amount based on the remaining term is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Provisions\n\nA provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A provision is included in the statement of financial position if we have an obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are discounted if the time value of money for the liability has a material effect.\n\n## Provision for pensions\n\nWe operate defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Under defined contribution plans, contributions to pension providers are taken to the statement of income as staff costs. We have no further payment obligations with respect to defined contribution plans once the contributions have been paid.\n\nA defined benefit plan is a pension plan which defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. Factors such as age, years of service and salary are taken into account when determining the amounts to be paid. The provision for defined benefit plans is the present\n\nvalue of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets.\n\nDifferences between the expected and actual return on plan assets, actuarial gains and losses and changes in the effect of the asset ceiling are recognised directly in equity; net interest is recognised under Interest in the statement of income.\n\n## Provisions for long-service benefits\n\nEmployees receive a bonus to mark a long-service anniversary of 25 and 40 years.\n\n## Restructuring provision\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognised only if the recognition criteria are met. We have a constructive obligation if we have a detailed formal restructuring plan identifying at least the business or part of the business concerned, the principal locations affected, the number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the expenditure to be undertaken and a suitable timeframe. Employees are also notified of the main features of the plan.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nOther liabilities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nLease liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as part of Other liabilities. Interest payments and amortisation in the year are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and disclosed within the statement of income.\n\nLease liabilities consist of interest and amortisation payments and are initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Subordinated loans\n\nSubordinated loans are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are carried at amortised cost. Purchases of our own subordinated loans are offset against the liability in the consolidated financial statements; the difference between cost and the carrying amount based on the remaining term is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Equity\n\nDirect costs of new share issues are deducted from equity, taking account of taxes.\n\nIf we purchase treasury shares, the purchase price, including direct transaction costs after tax, is deducted from equity. Treasury shares that we purchase do not qualify for profit or dividend and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position\n\nThis includes obligations that represent a potential credit risk and where it is either not probable that it will lead to an outflow of resources or that a reliable estimate can be made. For the other obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position, see 'Commitments' in the supplementary notes.",

This item consists of unused overdraft facilities, sale and repurchase commitments, irrevocable payment commitments for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and all other obligations resulting from irrevocable commitments that could give rise to loans.\n\n## Statement of income\n\n## General\n\nRevenue is recognised when it is likely that the economic benefits will flow to Van Lanschot Kempen and the revenue can be measured reliably. Costs are allocated as far as possible to the period in which the services were rendered or to the relevant proceeds.\n\n## Net interest income\n\nThis item consists of income earned on lending and costs of borrowing, derivatives, related commission, and other income/expense similar to interest. The amortisation of remaining value adjustments on mortgage portfolios of fair value hedges which expired in the past is presented under Interest income.\n\nInterest income and interest expense are recognised in the statement of income on an accrual basis, using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated cash flows over the life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period when appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, we take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example early repayment) but not future losses due to uncollectible amounts.\n\nNegative interest on derivatives whereby interest paid is recognised under Interest expense and interest received is recognised under Interest income. Negative interest on balances at central banks is recognised under Interest expense.\n\n## Income from securities and associates\n\nAll dividends received from investments in equity instruments are included under dividends and fees. Dividends are recognised directly in the statement of income when they are made payable.\n\nOur share in the results of equity-valued associates is recognised under Income from securities and associates using the equity method. Dividends received are deducted from the carrying amount of the equity-valued associate. Due to the fact that these investments in associates using the equity method are part of our investment strategy, we present income from these as part of our operating activities.\n\n## Net commission income\n\nThis item comprises the income, other than income similar to interest, earned on wealth management services provided to third parties. It also includes fees charged to the managed investment funds. Commission paid to third parties is accounted for as commission expense.\n\nWe receive commission for the wide range of services we provide to clients. This can be divided into commission on a transaction basis and periodic commission charged to the client during the year.\n\n## Commission on a transaction basis\n\nCommission income on a transaction basis is recognised in the periods in which we provide the services. Transaction commission for which we only provide a service on the transaction date (e.g. commission on buying and selling shares) is taken directly to the statement of income. Transaction commission for which we have to provide a service in the future (e.g. commission on structured products) forms part of the amortised cost and is recognised in the statement of income over the expected term of the instrument.\n\n## Periodic commission\n\nPeriodic commission (e.g. management fees) is recognised in the statement of income in the period in which the services are provided.\n\n## Result on financial transactions\n\nResult on securities trading includes realised and unrealised value differences on gains and losses on financial instruments relating to the securities trading portfolio. Exchange and price gains and losses on trading in other financial instruments are recognised under Result on foreign currency trading. Gains and losses due to ineffectiveness in hedge accounting are recognised under Unrealised gains/ losses on derivatives under hedge accounting. Result on economic hedges includes realised and unrealised gains and losses on derivatives that are not included in a hedge accounting model. Result on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss comprises unrealised value differences and interest expenses on financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income comprises non-banking income resulting from the consolidation of non-banking subsidiaries.\n\n## Staff costs\n\nStaff costs comprise wages and salaries, pension and early retirement costs, other social security costs and other staff costs such as remuneration in the form of share-based employee benefits.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nEmployees may be eligible to receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which the equity instruments are granted. The fair value is determined based on the share price on the grant date, taking into account the discounted value of expected dividends over the vesting period. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, in the period in which the employee's performance criteria are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award (the vesting date).\n\n## Other administrative expenses\n\nOther administrative expenses comprise IT expenses, costs of marketing and communication, accommodation expenses, office expenses and other administrative expenses.",

Tax effects of any losses incurred in certain jurisdictions are recognised as assets when it is probable that sufficient future profits will be available in the relevant jurisdiction against which these losses can be offset.\n\n## Earnings per ordinary share\n\nEarnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for possible dilution as a result of, for example, outstanding option rights.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method. It distinguishes between cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities include net changes in loans and advances, deposits from/with banks, and public and private sector liabilities. Investing activities include acquisition, redemption and sales of debt instruments, equity investments, associates using the equity method, property and equipment, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Financing activities include issues and repayments of share plans, debt instruments and issued debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents comprise, at face value, all cash in hand, balances at central banks and balances withdrawable on demand at other banks in respect of which the risk of value changes is insignificant. Investing and financing transactions that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents are excluded from the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Segment information\n\nThe different operating segments form the basis for our primary segmentation. An operating segment is a business unit that can earn revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by management or the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available. Additional information is reported geographically based on where the business activities are located. Intra-segment transactions are conducted on commercial terms and market conditions (at arm's length).",

Risk management supports the front office, clients and other stakeholders in ensuring that the risks incurred by Van Lanschot Kempen are controlled and comply with our risk appetite and legal requirements. This section describes our risk appetite, the organisational and governance arrangements that are in place regarding risk management, and the three lines of defence principle. After discussing these general arrangements, the section continues with credit risk, market risk, operational risk, settlement risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, securitisation risk, climate change risk, financial reporting risk and assets at fair value. An overview of compliance risk is also provided.\n\n## 1.1 Risk appetite\n\nSolid capital and liquidity ratios are essential prerequisites for a successful proposition to our clients and the financial stability of Van Lanschot Kempen in general. This is reflected in our risk appetite statement. We aim to have a simple and transparent balance sheet.\n\nWe have a robust risk appetite framework in place. Each year, the Management Board prepares the risk appetite statement, which translates our risk appetite into strategic limits. The risk appetite statement is then submitted to the Supervisory Board for review and approval. Quarterly risk appetite reports serve as important discussion documents for the continuous review of our risk profile.\n\n## 1.2 Organisation of risk, capital management and compliance\n\nThe purpose of our risk management framework is to identify and analyse risks at an early stage, as well as to mitigate and monitor those risks. Adequate internal control procedures and reporting systems, including the application of standards and limits, are key elements of the risk management framework.\n\nThe organisation of our risk management framework is based on the three lines of defence principle. Day-to-day responsibility for risk control lies with the front office and/or operational departments (the first line of defence) including internal control activities. Compliance, Risk Management and Finance, Reporting & Control form the second line of defence for financial and non-financial risks.\n\nThese departments are responsible for initiating risk policies and the supervision of risk controls within Van Lanschot Kempen. Internal Audit forms the third line of defence and is responsible for performing independent audits on the risk management framework and activities of the first and second line. This set-up creates a clear, balanced and appropriate division of tasks, powers and responsibilities, and ensures independent and effective operation of the risk management function.\n\nRisk Management stands at the core of capital management. We actively manage our capital base to cover risks inherent to our business and meet the capital adequacy requirements of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). The adequacy of our capital is monitored by using the rules and ratios established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as transposed into EU law through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). This legal framework also forms the basis for supervision by DNB through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and the Financial Supervision Act (Wft). Over the reporting period, we fully complied with all externally imposed capital requirements. Both external and internal capital adequacy targets are taken into account, and the central focus is on safeguarding our financial solidity and stability. Each year, a capital and funding plan is prepared for capital management purposes.",

It has set up two committees specifically for this purpose.\n\nThe Risk Committee focuses on all identified risks in the group's business activities, as well as the risk management framework. The Committee also prepares decision-making by the Supervisory Board on risk matters.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee is tasked with advising the Supervisory Board on financial reporting, internal and external audits, compliance and matters regarding duty of care.\n\n## 1.2.2 Risk, capital management and compliance\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for developing and executing the strategy of the group. This includes the capital and funding plan, which is based on a number of risk, capital and compliance policies.\n\nThe primary objective of our capital management is to ensure that we comply with external and internal capital requirements in order to support our businesses and to create value for our stakeholders. We manage our capital structure by taking into account changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of our activities. To maintain and/or manage our capital structure, we may adjust the amount of dividend payments to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities. These adjustments are under constant review by the Management Board. Finally, requests or demands by our supervisors DNB and/or ECB can also influence capital management.\n\nThe Management Board also bears responsibility for ensuring the proper operation of the processes that safeguard the group's liquidity and capital position. In addition, it is required to provide information to the Supervisory Board, which in turn assesses the risk appetite of the group. To ensure the various risk types are managed properly, the Management Board has set up the following risk committees:\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n- - Audit and Compliance Committee\n- - Risk Committee\n\n## Management Board\n\n- - Credit Risk Committee\n- - Risk Committee\n- - Market Risk Committee\n- - Compliance & Operational Risk Committee\n- - Asset & Liability Committee\n- - Credit Committee\n- - Product Approval & Review Committee\n\nTable 1.2 Risk, capital management and compliance framework\n\n| Risk         | Finance,             | Compliance   | Internal Audit            |\n|--------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| Management   | Reporting &  Control |              |                           |\n| Client       | Investment           | Treasury     | Credit Risk,              |\n| Management & | Strategies &         |              | Restructuring &  Recovery |\n| Origination  |                      |              |                           |\n|              | Solutions            |              |                           |\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nThe Risk Committee, which includes all members of the Management Board and the heads of Risk Management and Compliance, discusses overarching risk management themes. In this committee, the various risk types are brought together, discussed and monitored on an integrated level. The committee is involved in setting the annual risk appetite statement and discusses the risk appetite report and emerging trends in the risk profile. Other areas covered include recovery and resolution planning.\n\n## Credit Risk Committee\n\nThe Credit Risk Committee sets and adjusts the group's overall credit risk policy and translates this into acceptance and portfolio management policies. In executing its tasks, the committee bears in mind our strategic objectives and the guiding principles contained in the risk appetite statement. Two members of the Management Board serve on this committee (the CFRO and the member of the Management Board responsible for Client Management & Origination (CMO)), along with representatives of Risk Management, Private Clients, Credit Approval, and Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery.\n\n## Market Risk Committee\n\nThis committee focuses on all market risks within Van Lanschot Kempen and is chaired by the CFRO. Market risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates (excluding interest rate risk in the banking book), exchange rates and equity prices. It also considers variables not directly observable in the market, such as volatility and correlations, which also influence the value of certain financial instruments. Market risks at Investment Banking Clients occur due to the trading of securities (mainly equities and equity derivatives). Van Lanschot Kempen is exposed to a certain amount of market risk (mainly FX and structured products activities) through its treasury activities. The FX risk is limited, as the majority of transactions and positions in the statement of financial position are denominated in euros. Van Lanschot Kempen is also exposed to market risk as a result of management book investments.",

ALCO's main tasks are:\n\n- -Setting policies on interest rate risk in the banking book 1 , liquidity and funding risk, funds transfer pricing and capitalisation; 1\n- -Monitoring the development of the balance sheet and balance-sheet projections.\n\nALCO meets once a month and is chaired by the CFRO. ALCO's members comprise:\n\n- -The Management Board member responsible for Client Management & Origination;\n- -The Chair of the Management Board;\n- -Representatives of Treasury, Risk Management and Finance, Reporting & Control.\n\n## Compliance & Operational Risk Committee\n\nThe Compliance & Operational Risk Committee is responsible for the implementation and execution of our compliance and operational risk management policies. The committee assesses compliance and operational risks, and ensures remedial actions are taken if required. The committee also challenges and approves the annual plans of the Non-Financial Risk Management and Compliance departments. It is chaired by the CFRO. Among other things, the root causes of major operational risk incidents are discussed in this committee.\n\nRisk Management takes the lead in the committees described above, with the exception of the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, where both Compliance and Risk Management are in charge. We also have a number of committees that form part of the first line of defence and that cover specific risk-related topics, such as the Credit Committee and the Product Board.\n\n## 1.2.3 Implementation and review of risk, capital management and compliance policies\n\nImplementation and monitoring of our risk and capital policies is carried out by Risk Management and Finance, Reporting & Control. In addition, Compliance carries out the implementation, monitoring and/or review of compliance policies.\n\nInternal Audit is in some cases also involved in reviewing the policies described above if this is included in their annual audit plan.\n\n## Risk Management is responsible for:\n\n- -Business continuity management;\n- -Second-line monitoring and management of all risks relating to the statement of financial position at group level, including modelling, measuring, managing and reporting on our credit, market, interest rate, liquidity and strategic risks;\n- -Information security;\n- -Preparing, developing and maintaining policy documents;\n- -The risk appetite process;\n- -Preparing ICAAP and ILAAP documentation as well as the recovery plan;\n- -Issuing daily market risk reports;\n\n- -Proactively and reactively providing advice on managing risks;\n- -Raising risk awareness among staff in order to improve their ability to strike a sound balance between risk and return.\n\nFinance, Reporting & Control is responsible for the financial accounting and business control function. Through its various reports, Finance, Reporting & Control fulfils an important role in challenging the businesses.\n\nCompliance has both an advisory and a monitoring role with respect to compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and industry standards relevant for Van Lanschot Kempen. As compliance risks are part of the overall risk governance of Van Lanschot Kempen, Compliance as an independent function is involved in and supports the management of compliance risks by identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting on such risks. Compliance risks include risks such as personal data integrity, financial crime, business conduct and client protection risks.\n\nInternal Audit periodically reviews the design and effectiveness of the risk organisation and the execution of our risk, capital management and compliance policies in accordance with their annual audit plan. The department reports to the Management Board. The applicable policies form the starting point for the independent review by Internal Audit. Processes, infrastructure, organisation and systems are audited based on these policies in order to determine whether the organisation adequately executes its risk, capital management and compliance policies.\n\n## 1.2.4 Execution of risk, capital management and compliance policies\n\nThe commercial departments, i.e. the departments shown under 'Execution' in Table 1.2 (excluding Treasury and Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery), are responsible for preparing their business plans. On the basis of these plans, current and future risks are assessed, including expected capital and liquidity requirements. These assessments serve as input for ALCO.\n\n## 1.3 Capital requirements\n\n- -Pillar 1 stipulates capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk.\n\nThe standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and translated into law (CRR and CRD, Wft), apply to all Dutch banks. The Basel framework consists of three pillars:\n\n- -Pillar 2 requires banks to have internal processes for risk management and to calculate the capital requirements needed to address all risks that are not included in Pillar 1. The Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) is also part of Pillar 2.\n- -Pillar 3 sets out requirements for disclosure of information about the institution's risk profile to external stakeholders.\n\nOur website has Pillar 3 information (unaudited) and a detailed breakdown of our portfolio of loans to companies and institutions (unaudited), published once a year.",

They therefore cover a combination of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital requirements. The risk types covered are:\n\n- -Credit risk (Section 3);\n- -Operational risk (Section 5);\n- -Market risk (Section 4);\n- -Settlement risk (Section 6);\n- -Interest rate risk (Section 8);\n- -CVA risk (Section 7);\n- -Liquidity risk (Section 9);\n- -Climate change and sustainability risks (Section 11);\n- -Securitisation risk (Section 10);\n- -Compliance risk (Section 12);\n- -Financial reporting risk (Section 13).\n\n## 2. Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk can be defined as the threat to our results or equity arising from a failure to respond (adequately) to changes in external factors or from incorrect strategic decisions. External factors include the actions of competitors, clients, potential market entrants and public authorities. Strategic risk is not inherently undesirable, since there can also be an upside to taking on these risks. We take a forward-looking approach to strategic risk, keep a close eye on external developments and set our strategic priorities accordingly. Our strategy puts a strong focus on advanced data analytics, among other areas. Existing risk management practices and measures are assessed regularly to ensure that possible new risks that may arise from changes in strategic direction or in the business environment are captured adequately.\n\n## 3. Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty or client is no longer able to fulfil its obligations to the bank. Our credit risk policies focus on the counterparty risks associated with lending to private and corporate clients. Strict selection criteria for new clients and active credit management for existing clients are applied to safeguard the quality of the loan portfolio. The lending activities that we conduct are required to be in line with stated objectives, and individual assessments are used to ascertain this.\n\nAs well as from lending activities, credit risk also arises from:\n\n- -International payment transactions and cash management;\n- -Investment activities;\n- -Foreign exchange (FX) risk;\n- -Settlement risk.\n- -Hedging activities;\n\nOur investment activities relate to the management of our liquidity buffer and equity investments. For the liquidity buffer, a limit framework is in place to manage and monitor associated credit risks.\n\nCounterparty credit risk with respect to financial institutions arises from international payment transactions, cash management, FX and hedging activities. Some of these activities also involve settlement risk. For derivatives\n\ntransactions, counterparty credit risk is mitigated by daily margining.\n\nWe apply a strict policy when determining and monitoring country and counterparty (financial institutions) limits. The country limits serve as a cross limit for financial institutions, meaning that the counterparty risks in respect of financial institutions in one country are limited by the relevant country limit, as the country limit is usually lower than the aggregate of the individual counterparty limits.\n\n## 3.1 Loans and advances\n\n## 3.1.1 Credit acceptance\n\nOur loan approval policy focuses on maintaining a highquality loan portfolio. The authority to approve loans and loan reviews is delegated to a limited number of teams, mainly our Credit Approval team.\n\nThe authority to approve large loans rests with the Credit Committee, which comprises representatives of the relevant divisions as well as members of the Management Board.\n\nThe mid- and back-office for nearly all residential mortgage loans is carried out by a third party. A service level agreement (SLA) has been signed to ensure adequate control of the operational risks, including the outsourcing risk.\n\nThe acceptance process is not outsourced, with the exception of our white label loans - residential mortgages offered by a third party. The acceptance and management of credit risks has been outsourced to this third party, within our strict guidelines and in accordance with prevailing legal requirements.\n\nThese activities are closely monitored using detailed data from the mortgage portfolio. This makes it possible, for example, to recognise any arrears. We also review random samples of mortgage loans. An SLA has been signed to ensure adequate control of the operational risks, including the outsourcing risk.\n\nLimits on financial institutions and countries are determined using a number of hard criteria such as the external rating, BIS ratios, capital ratios, country of origin and gross domestic product (for countries). Limits can also be adjusted and withdrawn on a daily basis.\n\nNew loan requests are assessed to determine if they are in line with our strategy and we adopt a conservative approach to granting them.\n\nThe credit risk concentration mainly lies within our Private Clients segment in the Netherlands.\n\n## 3.1.2 Credit management - policy and processes\n\nTo achieve and attain a high-quality loan portfolio, strict credit management is required. Credit management is carried out at both individual loan and portfolio level. At the individual loan level, explicit attention is devoted to the management of unauthorised overdrafts and accounts past due. Loans with an elevated risk profile are subjected to a risk check. In addition, a portion of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and as part of this review the credit risk of individual clients is scrutinised. The frequency of reviews varies according to the individual borrower's risk profile, but they take place at least annually. In addition to the financial analysis, the review takes account of future developments in",

        "page_content": "the client's situation (partly in the light of relevant macroeconomic trends).\n\nA deterioration in a client's risk profile may lead to closer supervision, an adjusted rating, corrective measures (such as requiring additional collateral or increasing the frequency of financial reporting), involvement of the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department or a combination of these measures. It may also lead to a stage transfer under IFRS 9  - see Section 3.8.\n\nAt portfolio level, credit risks are monitored on a monthly basis. A detailed credit risk report and any relevant developments or expected developments are discussed in the Credit Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. Any negative trend identified in the risk profile of a particular client segment, sector or loan type, can lead to the adjustment of the relevant lending policy. Trends in sectors where there is a concentration risk are monitored particularly closely.\n\nIf the review, risk check, payment arrears or external signals point to an increased risk of discontinuity, the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department is involved in the credit management process. An estimate is made of the probability of continuity. Depending on the seriousness and magnitude of the problem, either monitoring or intensive supervision is applied. If there are objective indicators of impairment the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department draws up an impairment proposal. The Impairment Committee determines the impairment for the whole credit portfolio on a quarterly basis.\n\nActive management of past due loans enables potential problem loans to be identified at an early stage. If an individual assessment identifies an increased risk, the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department will supervise the client. Increased credit risk occurs in situations including the following:\n\n- -If clients report difficulties in meeting future payments, e.g. because of a divorce, unemployment etc.;\n- -If clients fail to meet their payment obligations;\n- -In the event of a default (see Section 3.1.3.1);\n- -For business clients, in the event of a significant decrease in turnover, breach of one or more covenants, a debt service coverage ratio < 1, etc.\n\nThe primary goal of the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department is to migrate clients back to accounts with regular status (i.e. not under the supervision of Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery) by reducing their credit risk. The aim is to do this in accordance with the loan agreements made with these clients, but forbearance measures are applied if necessary. More information on forborne exposures can be found in Section 3.2.\n\n## 3.1.3 Credit risk measurement\n\nWe have developed internal models for measuring and monitoring credit risk for the majority of the loan portfolio. Some of these internal models are also used to determine the required capital that has to be set aside for absorbing unexpected credit losses. For this reason, the models, the use of these models and the model governance have to adhere to strict requirements set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).\n\nThe CRR distinguishes three approaches for determining the required capital for credit risk: the standardised approach (SA), the foundation internal ratings-based (F-IRB) approach, and the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach. We use SA and A-IRB for our loan portfolios.\n\nThe standardised approach prescribes a set of rules for determining the required capital based on various characteristics such as client type, loan type, collateral type, and external rating. Under A-IRB banks are allowed to use own estimates for PD, EAD and LGD. The PD is defined as the likelihood that a client will default within one year, the EAD is defined as the bank's expected exposure at the time a client defaults, and the LGD is the expected loss percentage in the event that a client defaults. As a result, A- IRB is more risk-sensitive than SA.\n\nWe have approval from DNB to determine and report the required regulatory capital for our residential mortgage exposures portfolio using the A-IRB approach. For these models, we have a model governance framework in place. As part of this, the performance of the models is periodically monitored, and these models are also periodically validated against independent models.\n\nThe PD model is mostly based on behavioural aspects of the client and the LGD models on the underlying collateral. For the capital calculations a so-called downturn LGD is applied, i.e. the expected loss at default during an economic downturn. Estimation of the EAD is based on the limit and credit utilisation.\n\nFor all our other retail and non-retail portfolios the SA approach has been used for capital calculations.\n\n## IRB equity portfolio\n\nThe IRB equity portfolio includes our own positions in equities in the investment portfolio, subordinated receivables, non-controlling interests and shareholdings which appear on Van Lanschot Kempen's company statement of financial position. We use the simple riskweighted method to calculate the risk-weighted assets for positions in shares. In this method, a specific risk weighting (190%, 290% or 370%) is assigned to each position, based on a number of characteristics. A risk weighting of 250% is applied for significant investments in financial institutions that are not deducted from equity because they fall below the regulatory threshold. Positions taken in shares and subordinated loans of wholly owned subsidiaries are excluded from IRB. These are reported using the SA method.\n\n## Other loans and advances\n\nThe risk-weighted assets of the other portfolios, such as the debt securities in our investment portfolio managed by the Treasury department (i.e. excluding retail, non-retail and equity), are calculated on the basis of the standardised approach.\n\n## 3.1.3.1 Definition of default and credit-impaired assets\n\nIn November 2020, we introduced the new definition of default according to the EBA guidelines. Most notably, the materiality threshold was changed to a uniform European standard. The new definition of default had no material impact on ECL levels. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows have occurred:",

All impaired assets are also classified as defaulted by Van Lanschot Kempen under CRR rules. Van Lanschot Kempen has implemented one definition that serves for all the different purposes.\n\n## 3.2 Forborne exposures\n\n- -Amendment of the original terms and conditions of the loan agreement that the client cannot meet due to financial difficulties, with a view to restoring the client's payment capacity;\n\nA loan is considered forborne if the borrower is unable to meet its contractual obligations towards the bank and the bank decides to make a concession to the client by modifying the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. The objective of this modification is to enable the borrower to meet the renewed obligations, and it would not have been offered if those circumstances had not arisen. Forbearance actions may include one or more of the following measures:\n\n- -Full or partial refinancing of a forborne exposure.\n\nThe purpose of the measures taken in forbearance situations is to maximise the chance of restoring the borrower's payment capacity and to minimise the risk of losses due to having to write off all or part of the loan. The measures must offer the client an appropriate and sustainable solution, enabling them to comply with the original obligations arising from the credit agreement in due course.\n\nApplying forbearance measures is exclusively reserved for the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department, which pursues a policy based on general principles and translates this to the specific situation of the individual client. Given the nature of these loans, the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department carries out intensive credit management. Before any new arrangements are agreed, a detailed analysis is made of the client, their financial situation and the likelihood of income recovery. The outcome of this analysis may have consequences for the client's review frequency and the size of any loan loss provision to be made. If the client qualifies for appropriate forbearance measures, a proposal will be drawn up and submitted to the competent assessor(s) for approval. If a forbearance measure is granted, the client is classified as a non-performing credit.\n\nIn practice, forbearance measures do not always have the desired effect - i.e. the recovery of the client's payment capacity or an end to the process of declining payment capacity. This may, for example, be the result of a further deterioration in the client's financial circumstances or the failure of those circumstances to improve as expected. Such cases are reanalysed and a strategy is redefined. However, the principle is explicitly maintained that the forbearance measure must be appropriate, sustainable and effective. Any new arrangements agreed with the borrower must also meet these strict criteria.\n\nA forbearance situation ends when the non-performing status has no longer been applied to the loan for a probation period of two years. The non-performing status must last a minimum of one year starting from the last forbearance measure. The client must moreover have made significant and regular payments of interest and/or principal during at least half of the probation period. During the two-year probation period, no payments by the borrower may be in arrears for more than 30 days. If this condition is not met, the probation period will start again from the date the client is no longer in arrears for more than 30 days.\n\nThe recording and monitoring of loans which are subject to forbearance is carried out by the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department. Each quarter, and where appropriate more frequently for specific loans, an individual assessment is carried out of forborne exposures which are in default, in relation to any provision made. In addition to this quarterly assessment (as part of the provisioning process), these loans are subject to extensive credit risk management, the intensity and frequency of which will as far as possible match the specific circumstances of the loan.\n\nAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, a limited number of clients asked for financial assistance. In the 2020 MarchSeptember period, we assisted these clients with tailormade solutions: temporary payment suspension for a maximum of six months or temporary liquidity support. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on reporting and disclosure of exposures subject to measures applied in response to the Covid-19 crisis, these amendments were not registered as forbearance measures and, as a result, these exposures are not treated as non-performing. If further assistance or amendment of the terms and conditions were necessary, these exposures are classified as forborne and non-performing. At year-end 2021, only a very limited number of clients were unable to meet these amendments. As a result, these clients have been classified as nonperforming exposures.",

Our loan book mainly consists of loans to Private Clients such as loans secured by residential real estate, a number of\n\ncommercial real estate loans and securities-backed loans. The remainder of the loan portfolio comprises consumer loans and private customised financing (other loans), which are solely intended for clients who have placed substantial funds with us. The mortgage loans also include Kempen Dutch Inflation Fund, a fund that invests in leasehold contracts primarily in connection with Dutch residential real estate to create an investment in long-term Dutch inflationlinked cash flows.\n\nTables 3.4.A and 3.4.B have been drawn up on the basis of the definitions contained in the Basel regulations. The collateral value is the lower of the subscription value or the value of the collateral.\n\n| Table 3.3 Breakdown of loan portfolio by entity (excluding impairments)   | 31/12/2021   | 31/12/2021   | 31/12/2020   | 31/12/2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                                           | Limit        | Utilisation  | Limit        | Utilisation  |\n| Total                                                                     | 9,382,558    | 8,925,054    | 8,821,157    | 8,512,402    |\n| Van Lanschot Kempen (formerly Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management)      | 8,832,356    | 8,490,584    | 8,342,971    | 8,124,092    |\n| Kempen Capital Management                                                 | 164,431      | 164,431      | 175,614      | 175,614      |\n| Other                                                                     | 385,771      | 270,039      | 302,573      | 212,696      |\n\n## 3.4 Collateral\n\nIn general, collateral can be used for all current and future amounts owed by a debtor. In addition to residential mortgage collateral and guarantees provided by governments and credit institutions, commercial real estate, financial collateral, receivables, stocks and inventories may serve as collateral.\n\nThe majority of collateral is not directly linked to a specific financing arrangement.\n\nTables 3.4.A and 3.4.B provide insight into the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. An improved method to allocate the collateral over the different loan types was introduced. The comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Table 3.4.A Loans and advances to the public and private sectors by collateral at 31/12/2021\n\n|                                                     | Balance  outstanding   | Mortgage  collateral   | Commercial  real estate   | Financial  collateral   | Other   | Total  collateralised  loans   | Unsecured  loans   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Total                                               | 8,875,601              | 6,969,569              | 235,165                   | 604,609                 | 49,738  | 7,859,082                      | 1,016,520          |\n| Mortgage loans                                      | 6,723,806              | 6,485,017              | 6,131                     | 3,621                   | 6,645   | 6,501,415                      | 222,391            |\n| Loans                                               | 1,387,468              | 389,320                | 203,117                   | 220,336                 | 29,525  | 842,297                        | 545,170            |\n| Current accounts                                    | 484,107                | 61,900                 | 25,916                    | 182,411                 | 13,568  | 283,794                        | 200,312            |\n| Securities-backed loans and settlement  receivables | 280,221                | 33,333                 | -                         | 198,242                 | -       | 231,575                        | 48,646             |\n| Subordinated loans                                  | -                      | -                      | -                         | -                       | -       | -                              | -                  |\n\n## Table 3.4.B Loans and advances to the public and private sectors by collateral at 31/12/2020\n\n|                                                     | Balance  outstanding   | Mortgage  collateral   | Commercial  real estate   | Financial  collateral   | Other   | Total   collateralised  loans   | Unsecured  loans   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------|---------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Total                                               | 8,448,326              | 6,433,364              | 435,126                   | 124,151                 | 153,958 | 7,146,599                       | 1,301,728          |\n| Mortgage loans                                      | 6,512,265              | 6,184,439              | 14,962                    | 144                     | 9,269   | 6,208,814                       | 303,451            |\n| Loans                                               | 1,274,792              | 192,107                | 384,599                   | 51,859                  | 25,148  | 653,713                         | 621,079            |\n| Current accounts                                    | 363,652                | 31,612                 | 35,565                    | 49,716                  | 18,983  | 135,877                         | 227,775            |\n| Securities-backed loans and settlement  receivables | 297,418                | 25,206                 | -                         | 22,431                  | 100,557 | 148,194                         | 149,223            |\n| Subordinated loans                                  | 199                    | -                      | -                         | -                       | -       | -                               | 199                |\n\nThe category Other mainly comprises loans for which collateral has been pledged in the form of operating assets, inventories and receivables, as well as collateral which for technical reasons is not directly linked to a specific loan.",

In general, collateral can be used for all current and future amounts owed by a debtor.\n\nThe loan-to-value (LTV) of our mortgage loans is based on indexed foreclosure values. The average LTV at year-end 2021 is 62%. Our methodology for determining the LTV on residential mortgages changed in 2021. The calculation is now based on indexed foreclosure value instead of the amount of the mortgage registration. As the housing market has shown a strong upward trend in recent years, this results in a decrease in the LTV. The adjusted methodology is in line with the generally accepted norms for LTV determination.\n\n## 3.5 Concentration within the loan portfolio\n\nAbout 85% of our loan portfolio consists of loans to private clients. For the credit risk in this portfolio, see Section 3.8, Loss allowance for expected credit loss. We aim for a diversified loan portfolio, reflecting our risk appetite. We have set limits for concentrations in individual sectors.\n\n## 3.5.1 Individual loan concentrations\n\nThe ten largest loans to individual counterparties other than financial institutions totalled \u20ac244 million at year-end 2021, compared with a total loan portfolio of \u20ac8.9 billion (2020: \u20ac180 million; total loan portfolio \u20ac8.5 billion).\n\n## 3.5.2Geographical concentrations\n\nIn line with our strategy, the majority of lending takes place in the Netherlands and Belgium.

Loss allowance for expected credit loss\n\nUnder the IFRS 9 standard, we recognise a loss allowance for ECL on financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss, as well as for financial guarantees and loan commitments. When there is no significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL is recognised based on a 12-month expected credit loss (Stage 1). When a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, ECL is recognised based on a lifetime ECL (Stage 2). For impaired loans (Stage 3), a lifetime ECL is recognised.\n\n## 3.8.1. Expected loss measurement\n\nWe measure expected credit losses by using a sophisticated approach and an alternative approach. For the sophisticated approach we use models to calculate the ECL, governed by a model governance framework. Under this framework, the performance of the models is periodically monitored, and these models are also periodically validated. The IFRS9 models were externally validated in 2021 and are also subject to quarterly performance monitoring. If models are performing below the agreed threshold, recalibration or ultimate redevelopment will follow. In recent years, several recalibrations have been carried out; no redevelopment has yet been necessary.\n\nIn both approaches, ECL reflects an unbiased probabilityweighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money, and reasonable and verifiable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Both approaches calculate a 12-month and a lifetime ECL for the exposures of all three stages. After the risk stage determination in the stage calculation, the relevant ECL is assigned:\n\n- -Lifetime ECL for Stage 2 and Stage 3.\n\nThe key elements of the ECL calculation are the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD), loss given default (LGD), and loss given non-cure (LGN). The loss given noncure is an estimate of the loss arising in the event of a default without cure occurring at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral.\n\nIn addition to these four key elements, we incorporate forward-looking information for the sophisticated approach.",

        "page_content": "We identify macroeconomic variables and consider three macroeconomic scenarios in calculating ECL:\n\n- -An upside scenario;\n- -A base-case scenario;\n- -A downside scenario.\n\nThese scenarios are associated with different PDs, EADs and LGNs. In the process of building the PD, cure rate and LGN models for IFRS, we included several macroeconomic risk drivers in the long list of risk drivers. Those determined\n\nas best-performing during modelling were selected to be part of the model. The macroeconomic scenarios are generated based on inputs from the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB), DNB, ECB and Van Lanschot Kempen's economic experts. The reported ECL (12-month or lifetime, depending on the stage) is a weighted average of ECLs per macroeconomic scenario. The table below shows the macroeconomic variables used for the sophisticated approach.\n\n| Model          | Macroeconomic variables                                                                                                  |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PD calibration | - Gross domestic product (GDP) - Volume of exports (EXP)                                                                 |\n| Cure rate      | - Total investments (TI) - Private consumption (PC) - Residential real estate price (RREP) - Government consumption (GC) |\n| LGN            | - Gross domestic product (GDP) - Residential real estate price (RREP)                                                    |\n\n## 3.8.2. Significant deterioration in credit risk\n\nTo determine the deterioration in credit risk of a financial instrument since initial recognition, we compare the risk of default at the reporting date with the risk of default on initial recognition.\n\nTo calculate the lifetime probability of default (LPD) at origination and the LPD at reporting date, we use four PD models: private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, corporates, and commercial real estate. If the increase in LPD exceeds the designated threshold, the exposure is transferred to Stage 2 and the lifetime ECL is calculated.\n\nWe use the following thresholds for the different PD models:\n\n- - Private investments\n\n0.8\n\n- - Small and medium-sized enterprise\n\n0.9\n\n- - Corporates\n\n1.3\n\n- - Commercial real estate\n\n0.9\n\nA backstop is applied and financial instruments that are materially overdrawn and more than 30 days past due are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2. If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, it is transferred to Stage 3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.8.3. Financial instruments following sophisticated approach\n\n- -Various models that provide the expected flow of exposures to the default state;\n\nFor the majority of financial instruments included in the line item Loans and advances to the public and private sectors, including mortgage loans, loans, current accounts, subordinated loans and financial guarantees and loan commitments, we apply a sophisticated approach to calculate ECL. This approach uses an umbrella model that combines the following sub-models:\n\n- -A PD calibration model giving the flow from performing to default;\n- -A migration model providing flows from performing rating classes to other performing rating classes;\n- -A full prepayment model and amortisation model giving the outflow from the portfolio of an entire exposure due to prepayment or contract expiration;\n- -A cure rate model giving the flow from default to performing classes and the non-cure state;\n- -Various product-level models that give the expected exposure at the moment a client goes into default;\n- -An EAD model giving the exposure as a function of the limit or outstanding amount just before default;\n- -An amortisation model showing the contractual payments during the lifetime of a product and the part of the exposure flowing out of the portfolio due to partial prepayments;\n- -A product-level model evaluating the part of EAD that may be lost - the loss given loss (LGL) model;\n- -A discount factor to discount the loss from the moment of default to the moment of reporting.\n\n## 3.8.4. Financial instruments following the alternative approach\n\nWe apply an alternative approach for cash and cash equivalents, due from banks, debt instruments at amortised cost, debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, and loans and security-backed loans issued by the Belgian branch and F. van Lanschot Bankiers",

        "page_content": "(Schweiz) AG. The alternative approach comprises an investments model and a foreign loan model. During 2021, we further improved the investments model by making use of more forward-looking information, including European macroeconomic scenarios.\n\n## 3.8.5. Investments model\n\nThe investments model is applied to calculate the ECL for cash and cash equivalents, due from banks, debt instruments at amortised cost, and debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial instruments all have a low risk profile. All such exposures are assigned to Stage 1 as long as their external rating is investment grade. We use a simplified model to calculate 12-month ECL, using publicly available data for PD and LGD based on external ratings. If financial assets are downgraded below investment grade, these assets will be sold.\n\n## 3.8.6. Foreign loans model\n\nFor the loans and securities-backed loans issued by the Belgian branch and F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) AG, we have developed a foreign loans model. These two portfolios fall outside the scope of the A-IRB models and no requirements on historical data have been set. The foreign loans model calculates ECL as the sum of future exposure discounted at the effective interest rate at recognition for non-revolving products and the current effective interest rate for revolving products.\n\n## 3.8.7. Covid-19 impact\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and banking regulators have emphasised that entities should apply appropriate judgement when determining the effects of Covid-19 on ECL during this period of enhanced economic uncertainty arising from the pandemic. This is necessary because models based on historic data cannot make a reliable estimate of the increased credit risk stemming from Covid-19. Consequently, we have performed an additional\n\nreview of the loan portfolio. We monitored and examined client payment behaviour in the light of Covid-19, looking at whether we were able to derive additional signals from our list of arrears, monthly risk checks, a check on signals of declining savings or AuM, or, for commercial real estate, a combination of a low debt service coverage ratio and high LTV  to determine whether there had been a deterioration in credit quality. Based on this client-by-client analysis, we have implemented a management overlay on clients that have shown an increase in credit risk. This resulted in a PD increase, leading us to move these clients one risk bucket higher and transferring them from Stage 1 to Stage 2. In addition to the client-by-client analysis, we also investigated whether certain economic sectors showed a significant increase in credit risk. We concluded that this applies to the following industries: hospitality, leisure and commercial real estate (excluding residential real estate). We increased the PD of these sectors by moving these exposures one risk bucket higher and transferring them to Stage 2. We excluded exposures which were originated in 2021, because for these exposures the Covid-19 impact was already reflected in the interest rate of the loan. The total management overlay applied for individual clients and economic sectors resulted in a provision of \u20ac1.6 million (2020: \u20ac4.9 million).\n\nEven after incorporating this management overlay, the net impact on our credit portfolio was relatively limited. This is reflected in the comparatively small increase in expected credit loss (ECL).\n\n## 3.8.8. Loss allowances\n\nThe table below shows the ECL loss allowances and the corresponding book values, categorised by balance sheet line item and ECL by stage, as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2021.\n\n| Table 3.8 Loss allowance for expected credit loss                 | 31/12/2021                               | 31/12/2021           | 31/12/2020                               | 31/12/2020           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                   | Carrying value  (excluding  impairments) | Expected credit loss | Carrying value  (excluding  impairments) | Expected credit loss |\n| Total                                                             | 16,364,629                               | 51,572               | 15,137,318                               | 64,863               |\n| Cash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks           | 3,714,195                                | 0                    | 2,227,803                                | 0                    |\n| Due from banks                                                    | 71,275                                   | 0                    | 210,584                                  | 0                    |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 2,130,327                                | 328                  | 2,576,063                                | 416                  |\n| Loans and advances to the public and private sectors              | 9,266,829                                | 49,452               | 8,731,280                                | 64,075               |\n| Other financial assets at amortised cost                          | 257,406                                  | 8                    | 448,530                                  | 12                   |\n| Financial guarantees and loan commitments                         | 924,597                                  | 1,784                | 943,057                                  | 358                  |\n\nThe table below shows the total loss allowances recognised by IFRS 9 stage.

        "page_content": "## Stage 1\n\nThe model-based Stage 1 provisions on loans increased slightly to \u20ac3.6 million during 2021. Newly originated loans and regular redemptions and prepayments led to an increase in exposures of \u20ac555 million and an increase of \u20ac0.8 million in provisions. Transfers to and from Stages 2 and 3 led to an increase in exposures of \u20ac185 million and a decrease of \u20ac0.6 million in provisions. The total increase in provisions therefore amounted to \u20ac0.2 million. There were three main causes for this rise. Firstly, the increase in newly originated loans, mostly residential mortgages. Secondly, the transfers from and to Stage 2: due to improved credit quality, exposures were transferred from Stage 2 to Stage 1. These credit risk improvements are supported by low arrears in the loan portfolio and positive macroeconomic expectations for 2022 and 2023, taking into account the effects of lockdown restrictions and government support and relief measures. Some of the transfer of exposures to Stage 2 is caused by the management overlay. The macroeconomic figures published by CPB and DNB in November and December 2021 predict fairly stable economic growth in 2022. As stated last year, we still assume that for some economic sectors the model outcome does not (yet) fully reflect the present credit risks, and we have again applied a management overlay to exposures to adjust the credit risks in these sectors. As a result of the overlay, \u20ac199 million of exposures and their provisions were transferred to Stage 2. Thirdly, we applied various recalibrations of the IFRS 9 models during 2021. This has led to a very slight increase in Stage 1 provisions.\n\n## Stage 2\n\nStage 2 provisions decreased to \u20ac3.5 million. This includes the management overlay of \u20ac1.6 million, which was much lower than in 2020. This was due to improving economic circumstances, reflected in the economic growth figures from CPB and DNB mentioned above. Furthermore, improved credit quality led to lower provisions and a transfer of exposures to Stage 1. Most of these exposures are mortgages. In total, the amount of exposures in Stage 2 decreased by \u20ac175 million. The coverage ratio slightly changed compared with 2020.\n\n## Stage 3\n\nThe baseline for Stage 3 provisions is determined by our Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department, with limited IFRS 9 model adjustments. In 2021, Stage 3 exposures and provisions decreased significantly. Due to a release of provisions caused by fewer impaired exposures and limited new defaults, provisions fell to \u20ac42.4 million. This release was driven by a recovery in a broad part of the portfolio. Provisions for fully written off exposures increased slightly in comparison with 2020. The total impaired exposure fell by \u20ac33 million, while the coverage ratio hardly changed.\n\nLoss allowances for ECL change over time for several reasons: the credit risk of financial instruments may significantly increase or decrease, financial instruments may become credit-impaired, or new financial assets may be originated. The following tables explain the changes in the loss allowances during the year and the loss allowance recognised in the statement of income.\n\n| Changes in impairments of Financial assets at fair value  through other comprehensive income   |   Stage 1 | Stage 2   | Stage 3   |   Total |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| At 1 January 2021                                                                              |       416 | -         | -         |     416 |\n| Additions or releases without transfer                                                         |      -130 | -         | -         |    -130 |\n| New financial assets originated or purchased                                                   |        41 | -         | -         |      41 |\n| Total through profit or loss                                                                   |       328 | -         | -         |     328 |\n| At 31 December 2021                                                                            |       328 | -         | -         |     328 |\n\n| Changes in impairments of Financial assets at fair value  through other comprehensive income   |   Stage 1 | Stage 2   | Stage 3   |   Total |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| At 1 January 2020                                                                              |       549 | -         | -         |     549 |\n| Additions or releases without transfer                                                         |      -187 | -         | -         |    -187 |\n| New financial assets originated or purchased                                                   |        55 | -         | -         |      55 |\n| Total through profit or loss                                                                   |       416 | -         | -         |     416 |\n| At 31 December 2020                                                                            |       416 | -         | -         |     416 |",

Credit quality\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that are determined to be predictive of the risk of default. Credit risk grades are\n\ndefined using qualitative (applying experienced credit judgement) and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower.\n\nWe use internally developed rating pools for the line items Loans and advances to the public and private sectors and Financial guarantees and loan commitments.\n\n| Credit grade        | Description                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Investment grade    | Non-credit-impaired financial assets that are not placed under the supervision of the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery  department, internal rating pool 1       |\n| Standard monitoring | Non-credit-impaired financial assets that are not placed under the supervision of the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery  department, internal rating pools 2 to 4 |\n| Special monitoring  | Non-credit-impaired financial assets that are placed under the supervision of the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery  department, internal rating pools 1 to 4     |\n| Default             | Credit-impaired financial assets                                                                                                                                      |\n\nAll financial instruments under the line items Cash and cash equivalents, Due from banks, Debt instruments at amortised cost and Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income are investment grade, which means their external rating is at least BBB-. We use external ratings for these line items.\n\nThe credit quality of the line items Loans and advances to the public and private sectors and Financial guarantees and loan commitments is shown in the tables below.

Macroeconomic variables\n\nWe incorporate forward-looking information for the sophisticated approach. We use macroeconomic variables and consider three macroeconomic scenarios in calculating ECL: a base-case scenario, an upside scenario, and a downside scenario. The weightings of the scenarios were 25% for both the positive and negative scenarios and 50% for the base-case scenario as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2021. The table below shows the macroeconomic variables used for the sophisticated approach as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2021.",

The majority of collateral is not directly linked to a specific financing arrangement.\n\nFor credit-impaired financial assets, the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department determines the liquidation or recovery value of the available collateral, based on the most recent valuation reports and applying the applicable haircuts.\n\nThe table below shows the collateral for financial assets considered credit-impaired.\n\n| Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2021   | Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2021   | Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2021   | Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2021   | Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                | Gross exposure                                                 | Impairment                                                     | Carrying amount                                                | Value of collateral                                            |\n| Loans and advances to public and private sectors               | 162,207                                                        | 42,383                                                         | 119,824                                                        | 224,495                                                        |\n| Financial guarantees and loan commitments                      | 2,006                                                          | 21                                                             | 1,985                                                          | 3,459                                                          |",

The total carrying amount of creditimpaired financial instruments for which there is no impairment recognised is \u20ac50.4 million (2020: \u20ac73.1 million).\n\n## 4. Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates, exchange rates and share prices. Other variables not directly observable in the market, such as volatility, long-term dividend expectations and correlations, can also influence the value of financial instruments. The market risk to which we are exposed can be divided into two components: the market risk to which Van Lanschot Treasury (part of the Other activities operating segment) is exposed in respect of its necessary market maintenance, its structured products activities and services to clients. Market risk stemming from trading activities in institutional securities is concentrated at the Investment Banking Clients operating segment.\n\n## 4.1 Trading activities in securities\n\nOur trading activities in securities mainly comprise equities and equity derivatives. Equities are concentrated at the Investment Banking Clients operating segment (equity brokerage) while equity derivatives are concentrated at Van Lanschot Kempen Treasury (structured products activities). A governance structure has been created to facilitate effective risk management. The risks are managed using value at risk (VaR) limits as well as gross and net limits. Daily stress tests provide information about changes in portfolio values in extreme market conditions and complement the VaR calculation. The VaR for the trading portfolios is computed daily, based on a one-day time horizon with a 97.5% confidence level on one year of historical data. The continued validity of the assumptions underlying the VaR computation is regularly tested using back-testing. Other risks relating to derivatives, which are mainly embedded in our structured notes, are expressed in 'the Greeks' (e.g. Delta, Vega, Rho) and are separately monitored on a daily basis or more frequently if necessary.\n\n| Table 4.1 Trading activities VaR   | 2021                | 2021          | 2020                | 2020          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                                    | Derivatives-related | Share-related | Derivatives-related | Share-related |\n| At 31 December                     | 123                 | 174           | 431                 | 156           |\n| Highest VaR                        | 599                 | 333           | 1,515               | 388           |\n| Lowest VaR                         | 55                  | 79            | 141                 | 84            |\n| Average VaR                        | 233                 | 162           | 434                 | 192           |\n\n## 4.2 Market risk due to foreign exchange positions\n\nTo a limited degree, treasury activities (mainly foreign exchange exposure, comprising client transactions and own positions) result in positions exposed to market risks. The Treasury department is part of the Other activities operating segment. The majority of transactions and\n\npositions in the statement of financial position are denominated in euros. Exchange rate risk is managed within the required limits and an authorisation structure applies. Foreign exchange positions are shown in Table 4.2.B and include all cash, forward and option positions of the entities in scope of consolidation.\n\nSeparate limits are in place for all risk drivers. VaR and other relevant risk parameters are reported to senior management (including one Management Board member) on a daily basis. The embedded derivatives sold to our clients are hedged by Van Lanschot Kempen. In the second quarter of 2020, we moved from a macro-hedging strategy to an almost exclusively back-to-back hedging strategy. This means that the complex derivatives sold to clients were broken down into individual risk drivers (i.e. delta exposure on S&P500 or EurostoXX 50). The total macro exposure per risk driver is calculated and this is hedged by using relatively simple (mostly listed) options. All risk drivers have individual limits and we monitor them daily and/or intra-day, although some basis risks remain. Given that new business in structured products is almost exclusively hedged back-to-back, the total macro risk exposure will diminish significantly over time.\n\nLastly, exposure to market risks is also generated by investments in Van Lanschot Kempen's management book (notional \u20ac198.4 million; 2020: \u20ac115.9 million). These investments provide seed capital for newly launched Kempen funds and allow us to co-invest with our clients.",

This amounts to 6% of the net open positions in each currency (2020: 6%).\n\nCredit spread risk in the banking book (CSRBB) is the risk of\n\nvolatility in earnings and/or equity, caused by spread movements of the yield on banking book instruments that are classified at fair value, versus the swap curve. For Van Lanschot Kempen, CSRBB is mainly concentrated in the investment and liquidity portfolios. CSRBB limits have been imposed on these portfolios, which are monitored by ALCO on a monthly basis.\n\nWe use the maturity method to calculate the capital adequacy requirement in respect of the general risk on debt instruments in the trading portfolio. Share-related instruments are share instruments included under Financial assets from trading activities (see Table 4.3).\n\n| Table 4.3 Market risk        | 31/12/2021     | 31/12/2021                    | 31/12/2020     | 31/12/2020                    |\n|------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n|                              | Risk weighting | Capital adequacy  requirement | Risk weighting | Capital adequacy  requirement |\n| Total                        | 281,270        | 22,502                        | 241,258        | 19,301                        |\n| Interest-related instruments | 149,660        | 11,973                        | 110,333        | 8,827                         |\n| Share-related instruments    | 126,191        | 10,095                        | 130,462        | 10,437                        |\n| Currency-related instruments | 5,419          | 434                           | 463            | 37                            |\n\n## Weighting and requirements\n\nWe use the standardised approach for all types of market risk. The market risk of interest rate derivatives is included under Interest rate-related instruments; the market risk of share-related derivatives is included under Share-related instruments; and the market risk of currency derivatives is included under Currency-related instruments.\n\n## 5. Operational risk\n\nOperational risks are potential losses that result from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, inadequate or incorrect human actions, external events and fraud. Within Van Lanschot Kempen, operational losses are classified\n\nusing operational loss event types as set out in the Basel framework. Managing operational risks is the responsibility of line management (the first line of defence); this also includes the responsibility for information security and business continuity.\n\nWe have created a range of instruments for identifying, evaluating, monitoring and managing operational risks to support the bank's management in their roles as risk owners.\n\n- -Operational risk appetite : This appetite defines the level of - quantitative and qualitative - operational risk we are willing to accept. Exceeding this appetite requires the attention of the Management Board and will lead to additional mitigation measures as necessary.\n\n## 4.3 Market risk: interest rate and share-related instruments",

        "page_content": "- -Risk identification and assessment via risk and control self-assessments and scenario analysis:\n- \u00b7 Scenario analyses are used to assess low frequency but high-impact risks. The results of these analyses are used to provide insight into the adequacy of the Pillar 1 capital requirement vis-\u00e0-vis the operational risk profile.\n- \u00b7 Risk and control self-assessment is a tool that allows line managers to systematically identify and assess risks so that steps can be taken to manage any risks outside the risk appetite. Risk and control selfassessments are carried out, at tactical (department) level, on the most important value chains of the organisation and on our most important programmes and projects. These assessments are re-performed periodically in order to reassess and update the existing operational risk level.\n- -Risk response : Management is responsible for deciding how to treat risk, and whether to mitigate, accept or transfer (insure) it:\n- \u00b7 Control effectiveness monitoring : To ensure that the most important risks (key risks) are mitigated sufficiently, key controls have been defined; these are assessed on a regular basis to determine their effectiveness.\n- \u00b7 Action tracking : Action tracking is used to track progress made in the delivery of actions to mitigate identified risks, arising from risk and control selfassessments, failing controls, analysis of incidents or complaints, findings by Internal Audit and external regulators, and other relevant events.\n- \u00b7 Risk insurance : To protect the organisation against major operational risk-related losses, we have taken out insurance policies that cover claims and losses resulting from the services offered. Broadly speaking, these policies are a combination of fraud and professional liability insurance, directors' liability insurance and various other liability and accident insurance policies.\n- -Risk monitoring :\n- \u00b7 Risk acceptance : If a risk is assessed to be outside of the risk appetite and it is not possible or economically viable to lower the risk, the risk can be accepted at Management Board level.\n- \u00b7 Incident management : Risks that materialise through an incident are registered in our database via the incident management process. For severe incidents, root cause analyses are carried out. The incidents database allows the systematic recording and analysis of losses resulting from operational risks. It contains information about losses incurred as a result of operational risks in prior years and forms the foundation of Van Lanschot Kempen's operational risk management measurement system. A total of 99 incidents entailing a loss of more than \u20ac1,000 were logged in the database in 2021 (2020: 140 incidents).\n- \u00b7 Risk meetings : Periodic meetings with risk owners are held to monitor the development of the risk profile in relation to the risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 Risk measurement : This is based on key risk indicators (early warnings), which highlight trends and/or provide prospective information about operational risks.\n\n## Information Risk\n\nInformation risk assesses and monitors the protection of client and corporate information. Both automated and manual information processing are carried out. Taking the right measures on the basis of targeted risk analyses of business and IT processes ensures that both our client data and corporate data are adequately protected and access to this data is ensured.\n\n## Business continuity management\n\nComing out of the Covid-19 pandemic, Van Lanschot Kempen is following government guidance. After a period of gradually starting to go back to the office, with a number of basic rules applying, presence in the office was scaled down again at the end of 2021 due to lockdown restrictions. Our goal remains to ensure the health of our employees and provide our services at the same level as before the pandemic.\n\nBusiness continuity analyses are carried out as part of our business continuity management process in order to gain insight into critical processes and the resources needed to ensure continuity of service and address potential threats. Embedding business continuity management in the organisation is essential to give the bank sufficient resilience against the impact of an incident or disaster. Business continuity thus has universal scope within the bank; it comprises policies, standards and procedures aimed at safeguarding critical processes or enabling a restart within a specified timeframe in the event of a disaster. The objective is to keep any financial, reputational and/or other material damage to a minimum, both for us and for our clients. Procedures are tested on a regular basis, with tests of fallback procedures and crisis governance carried out every year.\n\n## 6. Settlement risk\n\nWe are required to hold capital for financial transactions that are not settled within five days of the agreed deadline, if the difference between the agreed settlement price and the price at the reporting date could lead to a loss.\n\nAt year-end 2021, financial transactions totalling \u20ac14.5 million (2020: \u20ac25.1 million) had to be reported in the context of settlement risk.\n\n## 7. CVA risk\n\nUnder the CRR, account must also be taken of the riskweighted assets in relation to credit valuation adjustment (CVA), which must be adequate to cover the risk of a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the counterparty in a derivatives transaction (OTC or cleared). This CVA capital adequacy requirement is additional to requirements applying to the risk-weighted assets in relation to the 'regular' default risk of a counterparty. We use the SA-CCR method to calculate the capital requirement for CVA.\n\n## 8. Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the exposure to adverse market interest rate movements, arising from banking book activities. Adverse interest rate movements may impact a bank's current and/or future earnings, capital and market value. Responsibility for IRRBB management has been delegated by the Management Board to ALCO. Interest rate risks in non-banking book items are managed as part of market risk.",

        "page_content": "Our main source of interest rate risk is the maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. In general, assets have longer interest rate maturities than liabilities, contractually as well as behaviourally. We model client behaviour with respect to the prepayment patterns of mortgages and loans and the interest rate risk profiles of savings and current accounts. Client behaviour risk is another important source of interest rate risk, as actually observed client behaviour may deviate from assumptions. Differences between assumed and actually observed client behaviour could have a material adverse impact on future results.\n\nWe pursue a prudent interest rate risk policy that aims to mitigate the effect of prospective interest rate movements which could affect future net interest income, while balancing the costs of hedging activities on current earnings.\n\nWe manage interest rate risk from both a long- and a shortterm perspective. The short-term interest rate risk is addressed mainly from a net interest income perspective (delta net interest income, or \u0394NII). This involves an analysis of the interest income under a number of market interest rate scenarios, relative to the baseline scenario in which interest rates are expected to develop based on forward rates.\n\nIn 2021, all \u0394NII scenarios remained within risk appetite limits. By year-end 2021, the most adverse scenario was a scenario in which yield curves flatten. In this scenario, we would have to swiftly increase the client interest rate on all deposit balances which are currently under a negative interest rate regime.\n\nThe \u0394NII for this scenario was -6.4% at the end of 2021 (end of 2020: -6.5%, in a scenario in which short term interest rates fall). Table 8.A shows the interest rate risk metrics.\n\n| Table 8.A Interest rate risk metrics   | 31/12/2021   | 31/12/2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Delta net interest income (\u0394NII)       | -6.4 %       | -6.5 %       |\n| Delta economic value of equity (\u0394EVE)  | -7.4 %       | -1.4 %       |\n\nWe address long-term interest rate risk by means of the economic value approach, which looks at how movements in interest rates impact the value of the bank's assets and liabilities. The rule-of-thumb metric for economic value analysis is duration of equity, which indicates the net impact of parallel interest rate changes on economic value, assuming a linear relationship between these parameters.\n\nIn the current interest rate environment, however, the relationship between economic value and interest rate changes is less linear due to, among other factors, \"floors\" in interest rates on various balance sheet items. For this reason, we focus not only on duration and delta NII, but also on the 'true' economic value changes under various scenarios, in which all interest rate cash flows are re-plotted and revalued at shocked interest rate curves. In calculating economic values, we use coupon rates that are 'stripped' from margins. In 2021, all delta economic value of equity (\u0394EVE) scenarios remained within risk appetite limits. By year-end 2021, the most adverse scenario was an instant upwards shock of 200 basis points. The \u0394EVE for this scenario was -7.4% at the end of 2021 (end of 2020: -1.4%).\n\nWe aim to neutralise the impact of differences in accounting classifications on interest rate steering. Hence, we mostly hedge the interest rate risk in fair value items in the banking book on a back-to-back basis, by means of interest rate swaps. By doing so, we make sure that Result on financial transactions - to the extent that it arises from banking book items - is only impacted by market changes in credit spreads over the swap curve and that there is no net impact from changes in the swap curve itself. For this reason, the \u0394NII scenarios we use to assess our interest rate risk profile do not affect the Result on financial transactions. We use hedge accounting to offset changes in the market value of derivatives that are used for hedging portfolios classified at amortised cost.\n\n## 9. Liquidity risk\n\nThe main objective of our liquidity risk management is to ensure that we are able to maintain or generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations in full as they come due, on acceptable terms. One of the key elements of\n\nour approach towards liquidity risk management is to maintain stakeholder confidence in the bank's solidity at all times.\n\nThe main source of liquidity risk that we are exposed to relates to the share of client deposits in our funding base. Although client deposits have proven to be relatively priceinelastic and sticky over time, the withdrawable nature of such deposits poses potential outflow risks, especially for those deposits not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme (DGS).\n\nThe roll-over risk with respect to maturing capital market funding is less substantial for us, since our client deposit base comfortably funds our entire loan book. To still obtain a certain degree of diversification in our funding mix, we have a covered bond programme in place.\n\nTo manage liquidity risks, we use a forward-looking liquidity risk management framework that enables the comprehensive measurement, evaluation and calibration of indicators related to liquidity risk. The framework consists of the risk appetite statement, the liquidity buffer, monitoring and reporting, forecasting, funding planning and contingency planning.\n\nLimits for liquidity risk are revised on an annual basis as part of the risk appetite statement. Limits set include, but are not limited to, levels of the liquidity coverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio and stress test survival periods, which are reported on a monthly basis to ALCO. The liquidity buffer is the main defensive element against liquidity risk, and the quality and size of the buffer are monitored frequently, along with in- and outflows in the client deposit base. Finally, each year we outline our capital and funding planning for a threeyear horizon, both under regular circumstances in the capital and funding plan, and under potential future stress or emergency situations in the liquidity contingency plan, complemented by the recovery plan.\n\nPart of our liquidity and funding planning is scenario analysis, of which stress testing is a key element. By means of stress testing, we assess our resilience to a variety of adverse liquidity events - Van Lanschot Kempen-specific events, system-wide events, and a combination of these two.",

For other derivative liabilities the contractual gross cash flow payable is included.\n\nAs savings and current accounts do not have fixed terms, the balances of non-maturity instruments are presented within the withdrawable on demand category.\n\nDue from banks and amounts due to banks include collateral delivered and received related to derivative transactions. Allocation of this collateral over the maturity buckets is conducted in accordance with the maturity classification of the derivative contracts.\n\nTables 9.1.A and 9.1.B show the assets and liabilities based on their remaining contractual terms to maturity at the reporting date, without taking behavioural aspects into account. These amounts correspond with the amounts included in the consolidated statement of financial position. Items with no maturity, such as equity instruments, assets and liabilities classified as held for sale, and provisions are presented separately.\n\n|                                                                     | Withdrawable  on demand   | < 3 months             | 3 to 12  months        | 1 to 5 years           | More than 5  years              | Subtotal               | Maturity not  applicable   | Total                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|\n| Assets                                                              | Assets                    | Assets                 | Assets                 | Assets                 | Assets                          | Assets                 | Assets                     | Assets                 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents and  balances at central banks            | 3,714,194                 | -

This results in a gap between the \"Withdrawable on demand\" and \"More than five years\" columns. Potential liquidity risks are addressed by means of monthly stress tests - discussed monthly in ALCO - that test the bank's resilience to a variety of adverse liquidity events and take behavioural aspects into account.\n\nFor each transaction we have guaranteed, the maximum guaranteed amount is included in the relevant term bucket under which the bank first has the right to terminate the transaction. For each obligation arising from an irrevocable commitment, the committed amount is classified in the relevant term bucket under which we first have the right to withdraw the commitment.",

Securitisation risk\n\nWe treat securitisation as an asset class in our investment portfolio. We are not party to any synthetic securitisations and have no trading position in securitisation transactions.\n\n## Funding\n\nWe do not structure securitisations for other entities and have no outstanding securitisations in which we act as a sponsor, seller and/or servicer.\n\n## Investments\n\nPart of our liquidity investment portfolio is invested in RMBS. We invest only in the most senior and AAA tranches of RMBS transactions. If they comply with the simple, transparent and standardised (STS) requirements, these securitisations qualify as high-quality liquid assets in an assessment of the liquidity coverage ratio. All tranches are ECB eligible, meaning that they have at least two ratings from an external credit assessment institution (ECAI).\n\nAs the investments are part of the liquidity buffer, they can be used as collateral, in repo transactions, or sold if necessary. The RMBS portfolio represents a small share of the total investment portfolio.\n\n## Risk exposures within the investment portfolio\n\nThe credit risks of the investments are not hedged. Our investment portfolio as a whole is monitored by the Treasury department and the Credit Risk Approval team on a daily basis. The portfolio is monitored on nominal limits as well as on credit risk limits.\n\n## Management\n\nInterest rate risk is limited, as RMBS are typically floatingrate notes. Interest rate risk is monitored at balance sheet level and includes the investment portfolio. We use the SECERBA methodology to calculate the total risk exposure of RMBS investments.",

        "page_content": "## 11. Climate change and sustainability risks\n\nClimate change risk reflects the physical and/or transitional impacts of a change in the climate on Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position and/or reputation. The risk of climate change to our activities is periodically assessed.\n\nClimate change risks are addressed in the following ways in the different parts of our organisation.\n\nIn investment management, they are taken into account when investments are made or investment managers are selected. On both a quantitative and qualitative basis, Risk Management measures and analyses the sustainability risks to our investment management activities. We aim to monitor limits set by regulators, our Sustainability Board or clients and provide insight into the sustainability profile of all of Van Lanschot Kempen's investment activities.\n\nIn our own investment book, we observe the Van Lanschot Kempen sustainability principles. With respect to climate change and environmental impact, objectives are currently determined on the basis of total carbon emissions. For the positions in our management book, the same Van Lanschot Kempen sustainability principles are adhered to.\n\nThe climate change risk to our Private Clients activities - the mortgage portfolio and, to a lesser extent, other loans - is assessed on the basis of total carbon emissions. Based on a methodology that looks at various risk types (e.g. credit risk, operational risk), the main sustainability risks (physical and transition) and the available data, there is currently no reason to apply a management overlay to the IFRS 9 models (Stages 1 and 2). In addition, the IFRS provision for Stage 3 is determined per individual credit file by the Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department. If there are significant climate risks relating to loans by this department that play a role during the period the file is in default, climate risks are included in the determination of the provision. A management overlay is therefore not necessary for Stage 3 either.\n\nFor our own organisation, climate-related risks are defined as the risk of flooding, earthquakes, drought and other natural hazards that could put the regular execution of our operations at risk. This risk is included in our business continuity stress-testing methodology as one of several scenarios that could lead to a prolonged disruption of facility usage.\n\nIn addition to climate change-related risks, Risk Management also looks at more broadly defined sustainability risks, such as biodiversity, human rights, and diversity and inclusion. These could very well lead to a combination of financial, reputational and legal problems in the long term when not addressed proactively. Risk Management closely monitors developments in these areas, as we recognise the increased awareness and importance of these. To reflect this, we have identified three themes (climate and biodiversity, smart and circular economy, and living better for longer) in which we can make a social and environmental impact and which we want to invest in together with our clients (see \"Our value creation\" on page 24).\n\n## 12. Compliance risk\n\nAs a specialist wealth manager, it is Van Lanschot Kempen's purpose to preserve and create wealth, in a sustainable way, for our clients and the societies we serve. When operating in\n\nfinancial markets, it is crucially important that we conduct our business activities in accordance with the expectations of our clients, shareholders, employees and competent authorities, but also that we follow high ethical standards, in alignment with our values and risk appetite, and within the boundaries of applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures and industry standards relevant to Van Lanschot Kempen. This increases the long-term sustainability of our  business activities and helps us to fulfil our purpose.\n\nWe maintain a permanent, independent and effective compliance function to identify, assess, monitor and report on compliance risk, i.e. the risk of failure by Van Lanschot Kempen to comply with regulations as applicable to Van Lanschot Kempen and/or of undertaking or failing to undertake those activities prohibited or mandated under applicable regulations. Additionally, we have put in place policies and procedures, systems and controls necessary to manage compliance risk.\n\nThe Compliance department is headed by the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Chair of the Management Board. The Compliance department fulfils its responsibilities by providing advice and assistance to Van Lanschot Kempen committees and staff, and by continuously monitoring adherence to regulations within Van Lanschot Kempen's day-to-day operations.\n\nCompliance risk remained a focal point for Van Lanschot Kempen in 2021, both from an internal and an external perspective. Externally, 2021 again brought changes that impact our regulatory landscape. One example was the EU's new Sustainable Action Plan, implemented through regulatory provisions such as the Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).\n\nWe are proactively responding to these external regulatory developments through the constitution of dedicated implementation working groups in which Van Lanschot Kempen's Compliance team takes part, as well as through other control functions within the company. Special efforts have been dedicated to the implementation of various sustainability-related regulatory developments, and we have been working extensively to adapt policies, procedures and controls to the new regulatory requirements as well as to the demands and expectations of clients and investors.\n\nIn addition to these external regulatory developments, we have devoted, and continue to devote, substantial resources to the strengthening of our compliance framework and our Compliance team. In this context, the Management Board has completed a group-wide project to enhance our antifinancial crime framework and its policies, procedures and controls. We have implemented the enhancements identified by this overarching project.\n\nSeparately, the Compliance team has continued to enhance the compliance framework through dedicated efforts to strengthen our policies and procedures across business lines as well as through the compliance risk management programme. We have also continued to develop and deliver a dedicated compliance training programme for staff. The Compliance team was strengthened in 2021 by the hiring of additional senior compliance experts, including a new Head of Compliance Risk Management & Monitoring. Further optimising Compliance is integral to our strategic direction.",

The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial reporting and that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legislation and regulations.\n\nWe have the following tools in place to manage financial reporting risks:\n\n- -A risk and control framework describing processes and procedures, and setting out primary controls such as authorisations and segregation of duties;\n- -Periodic management reports and KPI dashboards, accompanied by analysis of financial and non-financial figures and trends;\n- -The findings from the review of the operational effectiveness of the internal control system by Internal Audit, which are discussed with the Management Board, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n- -Assessment and approval of the annual report by the Management Board and discussion of this by the Audit and Compliance Committee and by the Supervisory Board.\n- -The Van Lanschot Kempen Accounting Manual, which sets out the principles we pursue with respect to financial accounting;\n\nThe management teams of the relevant divisions have provided the Management Board with in-control statements on the extent of internal control, based on the results of testing procedures for the risk and control framework, the risks reported on a quarterly basis, the follow-up of these risks, and the incidents reported.

        "page_content": "## 14. Fair value\n\n## 14.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nA portion of the financial instruments are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Tables 14.1.A and 14.1.B provide a breakdown of these instruments into three levels. The fair value is based either on quoted prices in active markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the market, or inputs based on data not observable in the market.\n\nWe have developed a policy on the criteria for allocating financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value to each of the three levels. A review is carried out at the end of each reporting period to determine whether any changes have taken place in the hierarchy between the levels.\n\n## Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is based on the price at the reporting date (market price). The bid price is applied for financial assets and the offer price for financial liabilities. Since these instruments are traded in an active market, their prices adequately reflect current and frequent market transactions between unrelated parties.\n\n## Level 2: Inputs observable in the markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (e.g. over-the-counter financial derivatives) is established using cash flow and option valuation models. Using estimates, we make assumptions based on the market conditions (observable data) at the reporting date.\n\nThe estimated present value of future cash flows is used to\n\ndetermine the fair value of the other financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows. The discount rate is the same as the market interest rate at the reporting date for a similar instrument subject to the same conditions, taking into account collateral furnished under credit support annexes (CSAs).\n\nThe fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to forward exchange rates at the reporting date.\n\nEstimates and judgements made are based on past experience as well as other factors, including expectations with respect to future events that could reasonably occur given current circumstances. Estimates and judgements are assessed on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Level 3: Significance of unobservable market data\n\nThe financial instruments in this category are assessed on an individual basis. Their valuation is based on the best estimate of management by reference to the most recent prices, prices of similar instruments and, to a not insignificant extent, information not observable in the market. Unobservable inputs may include volatility, correlation, seasonality and credit spreads. A valuation technique is used in which at least one input that has a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. A significant effect on the instrument's valuation is considered to be present when the unobservable input accounts for at least 10% of the total instrument's fair value and exceeds a threshold of \u20ac50,000. The effect of fair value adjustments on the instrument's valuation is included in the assessment.\n\n|                                                                   | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Total     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assets                                                            |           |           |           |           |\n| Financial assets from trading activities (FVPL)                   | 29,704    | 1,136     | 36        | 30,876    |\n| Derivatives (FVPL)                                                | 48,478    | 204,168   | 225       | 252,872   |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             | 224,196   | 46,170    | 28,760    | 299,126   |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 2,130,327 | -         | -         | 2,130,327 |\n| Total assets                                                      | 2,432,705 | 251,474   | 29,021    | 2,713,200 |\n| Liabilities                                                       |           |           |           |           |\n| Financial liabilities from trading activities (FVPL)              | 53        | -         | -         | 53        |\n| Derivatives (FVPL)                                                | 48,255    | 131,119   | 743       | 180,117   |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss        | -         | 466,217   | 94,204    | 560,421   |\n| Total liabilities                                                 | 48,308    | 597,336   | 94,947    | 740,591   |",

This divides the variables used into observable and unobservable market inputs. If the unobservable input variables are significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. An unobservable input variable is significant if the change in the fair value due to the application of the variable is greater than the threshold values. Our policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn 2021, our valuation technique remained unchanged, with non-observable input variables being assessed on significance. As a result of this assessment, some financial instruments included in Derivatives (assets and liabilities) and in Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss have been transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 and vice versa. The Derivatives receivables and payables and Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss were transferred\n\nto Level 2 as a result of the input variables' correlation and seasonality; the shorter remaining term to maturity of these financial instruments meant that these input variables qualified as non-significant, justifying a transfer to Level 2. In the case of Derivatives (assets), this entailed a transfer of \u20ac0.0 million from Level 2 to Level 3 and a transfer of \u20ac3.6 million from Level 3 to Level 2. In the case of Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, it involved a transfer of \u20ac0.0 million from Level 2 to Level 3. The transfer of Derivatives (liabilities) includes a \u20ac0.5 million shift from Level 3 to Level 2.\n\n## Breakdown of movements in financial assets and liabilities classified under Level 3\n\n| Table 14.1.C Breakdown of changes in financial liabilities classified as Level 3 in 2021   | At 1 January   | To statement of income   | To equity 1   | Issues      | Settlements   | Transfers   | At 31  December   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Assets                                                                                     | Assets         | Assets                   | Assets        | Assets      | Assets        | Assets      | Assets            |\n| Financial assets from trading activities (FVPL)                                            | 480            | -2                       | -             | 16          | -458          | -           | 36                |\n| Derivatives (FVPL)                                                                         | 4,565          | 207                      | -             | -           | -1,088        | -3,459      | 225               |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                                      | 21,099         | 8,370                    | -             | 82          | -791          | -           | 28,760            |\n| Total assets                                                                               | 26,144         | 8,575                    | -             | 98          | -2,336        | -3,459      | 29,021            |\n| Liabilities                                                                                | Liabilities    | Liabilities              | Liabilities   | Liabilities | Liabilities   | Liabilities | Liabilities       |\n| Derivatives (FVPL)                                                                         | 1,859          | -                        | -             | 743         | -1,049        | -810        | 743               |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or  loss                                | 47,464         | -11,134                  | -             | 101,550     | -6,000        | -37,676     | 94,204            |\n| Total liabilities                                                                          | 49,323         | -11,134                  | -             | 102,293     | -7,049        | -38,486     | 94,947            |\n| Total assets less liabilities                                                              | -23,179        | 19,710                   | -             | -102,195    | 4,713         | 35,026      | -65,926           |",

If there is an active market, we use the market value to determine the fair value. For financial instruments for which no market prices are available, the fair values shown in Table 14.2 are estimated on the basis of the present value or using other estimation or valuation methods.\n\nTable 14.2 shows the carrying amount and fair value of financial instruments at amortised cost, with the exception of line items Cash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks, Other assets and Other liabilities. For these financial instruments the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.\n\n|                                                       | 31/12/2021 31/12/2020 Level                       | 31/12/2021 31/12/2020 Level   | 31/12/2021 31/12/2020 Level   | 31/12/2021 31/12/2020 Level   | 31/12/2021 31/12/2020 Level                                                                                                                                 | 31/12/2021 31/12/2020 Level                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                       | Fair value Carrying  amount                       | Fair value Carrying  amount   | Fair value                    | Carrying  amount              | Valuation method                                                                                                                                            | Significant observable and  unobservable market inputs     |\n| Assets                                                |                                                   |                               |                               |                               |                                                                                                                                                             |                                                            |\n| Due from banks                                        | 71,248                                            | 71,275                        | 210,420                       | 210,584                       | 2 Discounted cash flows using  applicable money market  rates                                                                                               | Interest rate and discount  rate                           |\n| Loans and advances to the public  and private sectors | 9,153,124   8,875,601   8,652,262   8,448,326     |                               |                               |                               | 3 Discounted cash flows using  current market fees for  comparable loans and taking  into account the  creditworthiness of the  counterparty                | Interest rate, discount rate  and counterparty credit risk |\n| Other financial assets at amortised  cost             | 260,785                                           | 257,399                       | 457,808                       | 448,518                       | 1 Quoted prices in active  markets                                                                                                                          | -

The additions to Goodwill, Client relationships and Brand names are due to the shareholding in Mercier Vanderlinden that we acquired as part of the partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden in Belgium in 2021; see 'Business combinations in 2021'. The goodwill in Non-strategic investments is derecognised due to the sale of our subsidiary Holowell.\n\nAs of 1 January 2021, we changed our organisational structure by moving from a business line-driven organisation towards an integrated model. As a consequence, the cash-generating unit (CGU) level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes has changed accordingly. The goodwill is reallocated to the newly determined CGUs.\n\nWe have defined six CGUs, namely Private Clients, Wholesale & Institutional Clients, Investment Banking Clients, Mercier Vanderlinden, Non-strategic investments,\n\nand Other. These correspond to our operating segments (see section on segment information) except for CGU Nonstrategic investments and CGU Mercier Vanderlinden. Segment Other is split between the CGUs Other and Nonstrategic investments. CGU Mercier Vanderlinden is part of the Private Clients segment. Goodwill from the partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden is allocated, for the purpose of the annual impairment test, to the CGU Private Clients.\n\nThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the performance of the CGUs with allocated goodwill has been limited during 2021, as it was in 2020. The Private Clients and Investment Banking Clients segments have performed strongly. Although the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment faced AuM outflow during the year, its financial performance was solid and the projected financial results do not indicate a trigger for impairment.",

        "page_content": "We carried out our annual impairment test on the goodwill arising from acquisitions in the current and prior years. To determine whether an impairment is necessary, the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is calculated on the basis of value in use. This calculation uses equity cash flow projections for each CGU or group of CGUs for a five-year period. These projections are based on the current year and on the financial estimates for the years 2022 until 2025 used by management in its strategic forecast at the end of 2021. For the period after the explicit projections per CGU or group of CGUs, the growth rate is set at the long-term market growth rate of 1.0%. This growth rate applies to all CGUs, as in the long term all CGUs will be impacted by the same economic market developments. The rate is based on our own projections and on wealth management market projections by market experts.\n\nManagement has compared the main assumptions against market forecasts and expectations. Cash flow estimates are based on our strategic plans and potential future trends. Events and factors that could have a significant impact on the estimates include stock and bond market developments, effects of mergers and acquisitions, competitive conditions, client behaviour and changes in the client relationships, cost structure, trends in inflation, interest rates and risks, and other circumstances specific to the industry and sector. Equity cash flows are discounted using a cost of equity for each CGU or group of CGUs that reflects the risk-free interest rate, supplemented with a surcharge for the market risk exposure of the CGU or group of CGUs, and a smallfirm premium.\n\n| CGU                                     | Discount rate before tax %   | Discount rate before tax %   | Discount rate after tax %   | Discount rate after tax %   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                         | 2021                         | 2020                         | 2021                        | 2020                        |\n| Private Clients                         | 11.4                         | n/a                          | 8.6                         | n/a                         |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients       | 13.6                         | n/a                          | 10.2                        | n/a                         |\n| Investment Banking Clients              | 12.6                         | 12.3                         | 9.5                         | 9.2                         |\n| Non-strategic investments               | n/a                          | 13.4                         | n/a                         | 10.1                        |\n| Private Banking (until 1 January 2021)  | n/a                          | 8.5                          | n/a                         | 6.4                         |\n| Asset Management (until 1 January 2021) | n/a                          | 10.8                         | n/a                         | 8.1                         |\n| Merchant Banking (until 1 January 2021) | n/a                          | 12.3                         | n/a                         | 9.2                         |\n\nThe impairment test performed in 2021 did not result in goodwill impairments. The model uses one base-case scenario. For the CGUs with allocated goodwill, a sensitivity analysis was also carried out on the base-case scenario, focusing particular attention on changes in long-term growth, the discount rate and the long-term EBIT margin. This analysis is captured in the sensitivity table below and underlines our conclusion that no impairment is needed.\n\nIn addition, an annual test is carried out for indications of impairment of other intangible assets with a finite useful life. For the line item Client relationships, movements in the assets under management volume are assessed. The useful life tests carried out in 2021 provided no indication of a need for further examination, nor of impairments.\n\n| Sensitivity analysis              | Change required in each key assumption for headroom  to equal zero, in percentage points   | Change required in each key assumption for headroom  to equal zero, in percentage points   | Change required in each key assumption for headroom  to equal zero, in percentage points   |                                            |         |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|\n|                                   | Headroom                                                                                   | Net profit margin                                                                          | Cost of equity                                                                             | Headroom with  terminal growth rate at  0% |         |\n| Private Clients                   | 500,294                                                                                    | -10.6 %                                                                                    |                                                                                            | 5.0 %                                      | 442,692 |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients | 71,615                                                                                     | -8.5 %                                                                                     |                                                                                            | 12.6 %                                     | 65,134  |\n| Investment Banking Clients        | 64,904                                                                                     | -10.7 %                                                                                    | 7.5 %                                                                                      |                                            | 58,303  |\n\n|                                            | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027-33   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Expected amortisation of intangible assets | 15,108 | 14,281 | 13,982 | 11,671 | 11,122 | 78,937    |",

Tax losses incurred can be offset against taxable profits in future years. Based on the most recent forecast, it is likely that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to offset the existing tax losses.\n\nThe non-current portion of deferred tax assets that is expected to be recovered or settled after more than 12 months amounts to \u20ac32.2 million. See Note 34, Income tax, for more information.\n\n|   Tax losses to be offset Financial year | Amount   | Final year for offsetting   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|\n|                                     2016 | 4,235    | indefinitely                |\n|                                     2017 | 736      | indefinitely                |\n|                                     2018 | 1,457    | indefinitely                |\n|                                     2019 | 613      | indefinitely                |\n|                                     2020 | -        | indefinitely                |\n|                                     2021 | 4,323    | indefinitely                |\n\nThe total amount of tax losses is recognised as a deferred tax asset based on the prevailing tax rate. The losses of 2016 through 2020 arose from the permanent establishment in Belgium.\n\nThe loss of 2021 arose from KCM UK Ltd in the UK. As neither country applies a time limit for offsetting losses, they can be carried forward indefinitely. In 2021, a loss amount of \u20ac6.4 million was set off against the current year result.\n\n|                     | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Unrecognised losses | 7,038  | 9,499  |\n\nUnrecognised losses are losses for which it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised. The decrease in\n\nunrecognised losses is due to a positive result at Allshare and the liquidation of Van Lanschot Invest in Belgium.",

The programme is an initiative of the ECB aimed at providing long-term funding at favourable cost so long as banks support lending to firms and households. In response to Covid-19, in Decision (EU) 2020/614 of 30 April 2020 and Decision (EU) 2021/124 of 29 January 2021, the ECB introduced measures that provide for a temporary reduction in interest rates when certain conditions are met by TLTRO III participants. The TLTRO III loans are accounted for as a financial liability under IFRS 9 (at amortised cost), and collateralised by eligible securities. This programme has a maturity of three\n\nyears with an option to redeem every quarter from September 2021 onwards.\n\nThe interest rate is linked to the ECB deposit rate. The benefit of the below-market rate of interest is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 and is included in the calculated effective interest rate of the loan. This is recognised in the income statement under \"Interest income calculated using the effective interest method\" over the term of the TLTRO III loans. Based on the current information, it is highly probable that we will meet the eligibility criteria as at year-end 2021 and thus receive the forecast below-market rate of interest.\n\n| 16.

Structured debt instruments decreased mainly due to sales and redemption.\n\nWe have issued debt instruments which are managed on the basis of fair value. The fair value is paid to the issuer on maturity date. Management believes that valuation at fair value through profit or loss applies, as this largely eliminates or reduces inconsistencies in valuation and disclosure, and performance is assessed on the basis of fair value.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include non-structured debt instruments such as floating-rate notes and fixed-rate notes, and structured debt instruments such as index guarantee notes and trigger notes. Our own credit risk in the reporting year increased by \u20ac5.5 million (2020: down \u20ac7.6 million), reflecting a decrease of \u20ac5.6 million on the back of our improved own credit quality, together with an increase of \u20ac11.1 million for the passage of time and for the decrease in the notional amount.

        "page_content": "Compared with 2020, provisions decreased by \u20ac12.0 million, mainly due to to the provision for pensions.\n\nIn line with previous rulings by the Dutch Institute for Financial Disputes (Kifid), we will repay current and former clients for too much variable interest charged on revolving consumer credit. We conducted a full review of the revolving consumer credit products that have been offered to our clients. Our investigations revealed that only a small group of clients was affected, as Van Lanschot Kempen mainly focuses on growing its clients' capital and less on revolving consumer credit. Van Lanschot Kempen has earmarked \u20ac3.3 million to provide for the interest to be compensated and the costs incurred in carrying out the scheme. The impact on the income statement is reflected in Note 25, Net interest income, under line item Interest income on banks and private sector (\u20ac2.4 million) and in Note 31, Other administrative expenses, under line item Other (\u20ac0.9 million).\n\nWe operate a number of employee schemes under which participants receive payments or benefits after they retire. Specifically, there is a pension scheme and a discount scheme for mortgage interest rates, as well as a longservice benefits scheme.\n\nThe following defined benefit schemes were valued for the purpose of the 2021 financial statements:\n\n- -The long-service benefits depend on the number of years of service.\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen employees were eligible for discounted mortgage interest rates. Entitlement to this discount continued beyond retirement from active service. This plan was closed to new entrants after 2015.\n- -The early retirement plan concerns a limited number of employees who were working at the Belgian branch. The outstanding amount is diminishing as this plan has been terminated.\n- -Until year-end 2019, Kempen operated an average salary scheme under which 1.875% of the pensionable salary - salary less state pension offset, with an annual ceiling of \u20ac41,232 - was accrued for each year of service and which was based on a retirement age of 68. The surviving dependants' pension was insured on a risk basis.\n- -Both a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme are in place for employees working at the Belgian branch. The pensionable salary for the defined benefit scheme is taken as the average basic salary over the last five years of service. The pension capital is insured with UKZT (Uitgesteld Kapitaal Zonder Tegenverzekering). The accompanying term life assurance is funded from risk premiums. The defined contribution pension plans have been set up according to the Belgian method of defined contributions but do not fulfil all the criteria of a defined contribution pension plan according to IAS 19. For this reason, the defined contribution pension plans are treated as a defined benefit plan in the consolidated financial statements.\n- -The pension plans of F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) have been set up according to the Swiss method of defined contributions but do not fulfil all the criteria of a defined contribution pension plan according to IAS 19. For this reason, the Swiss pension plans are treated as defined benefit plans in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOnly within a Kempen pension scheme, plan assets fund the obligations (i.e. the scheme is funded). The other schemes are unfunded; payments in any year are made directly by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe pension schemes have been placed with insurers and a\n\npension institution, which are responsible for the pension administration, risk insurance and communication of legal documents to employees who are scheme members. Decisions on and changes to pension scheme content are taken by an internal pensions committee. Where applicable, in the Netherlands the Works Council is consulted for its opinion and/or consent.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's pension schemes were adjusted and replaced from 1 January 2020 by a single new plan. The new scheme is an individual defined contribution scheme. The former Van Lanschot scheme is classified as a collective defined contribution scheme, and the change of scheme has no impact from an accounting perspective. Because there is still an obligation to pay guarantee costs and to provide indexation on the accrued pension benefits, the remainder of the provision (\u20ac27.9 million) stays on the balance sheet. As it has no legally enforceable right to use the surplus in plan assets for settling the obligations for indexation and guarantee costs, Van Lanschot Kempen applies an asset ceiling to the relevant assets in the pension scheme.\n\nThe defined benefit obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method.",

Other movements include interest charges for the time value of money which were compensated by paid-out dividends. The increase in Other is partly offset by the payment of the purchase price (-\u20ac31.5 million) and revaluation of the contingent consideration (-\u20ac1.2 million) related to the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers.",

For information on the transfer from Other reserves to the Share premium reserve, see Note 35, Earnings per share.\n\nThe proposed dividend for 2021 is set at \u20ac2.00 per ordinary share (2020: \u20ac0.70 per share and 2019: \u20ac1.45 per share). At the general meeting to be held on 25 May 2022, shareholders will be invited to approve the distribution of the dividend. With the 2019 and 2020 dividends approved by the AGMs on 28 May 2020 and 27 May 2021, we paid out part of the 2020 dividend (\u20ac0.20 per share) in June 2021 as well as the 2019 dividend and the remainder of the 2020 dividend (\u20ac1.95 per share) in October 2021, in line with the recommendation by the ECB and DNB.",

The actuarial gains and losses related to a shortfall in minimum performance on defined contribution plan assets, required under Belgian and Swiss law, are also included.\n\nCurrency translation reserve : This reserve (which is not available for free distribution) includes currency exchange differences resulting from the valuation of investments in group companies at the prevailing exchange rate in so far as the currency rate risk is not hedged.\n\nOwn credit risk reserve : This includes the changes in Van Lanschot Kempen's own credit risk of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nCash flow hedge reserve : This includes the share in the gain or loss on hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge that has been designated as an effective hedge.\n\nRetained earnings : This includes past profits added to equity and changes in connection with the share scheme.\n\n| 24.

It is impossible to predict whether, when and how much of these contingent liabilities will be claimed.\n\n## Contingent assets\n\nIn 2015, Van Lanschot Kempen started an appeal against the Dutch tax authorities ( Belastingdienst ) regarding the applied pro-rata percentage which is used for the calculation of its VAT returns in the Netherlands. In March 2020, the Court in Den Bosch ruled in favour of Van Lanschot Kempen. This ruling results in Van Lanschot Kempen being able to claim VAT from the Dutch tax authorities for the previous years (2014-20), which had already been paid. In August 2020, the Dutch tax authorities appealed against the ruling at the Supreme Court. In November 2021, we received the opinion of the\n\nAdvocate General of the Supreme Court. The indicated time frame for the Supreme Court's ruling is now May-July 2022.\n\nThe following movements are related to the gross carrying amount of the contingent liabilities and the irrevocable commitments.

Net interest income includes a provision for revolving consumer credit of \u20ac2.4 million. For more information, see Note 19, Other provisions.\n\nThe interest income on balances at central banks is related to the negative interest paid on the special loans from the ECB recognised under Due to banks. The interest result on loans subject to impairment was \u20ac1.8 million (2020: \u20ac2.9 million).\n\n| 26.

In July, we sold our 42.5% interest in Fire Safety Holding BV (Gerco) with a gain of \u20ac11.2 million. Also in July, the 18% stake in Quint Holding was sold and a gain of \u20ac4.7 million was realised. Realised and unrealised gains on investments at fair value through profit or loss rose significantly compared with year-end 2020, mainly due to positive market performance and consequently higher result in our management book. Main\n\ncontributor to the valuation gains was Newion II (\u20ac9.9 million), as its interest in Collibra increased in value on a new capitalisation round. Other gains on sales increased mainly due to the sale of our non-strategic investment in Holowell (\u20ac3.1 million) and Global Property Research BV (\u20ac2.7 million).",

The balance of losses on economic hedges and losses on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss came in \u20ac15.8 million higher. This balance reflects the revaluation result caused by changes in capital market yields in the marked-to-market portfolio and a number of derivatives positions.\n\nExceptional volatility and illiquidity in certain segments of the financial markets in reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic that began in March 2020 led to pre-tax losses of \u20ac35.1 million at our structured product activities in 2020.\n\nThis was recognised in the line item Gains/losses on economic hedges/hedge accounting not applied. In response to the loss in 2020, we are working with a lower risk appetite.\n\nThe revaluation of the contingent consideration related to the acquisitions of Mercier Vanderlinden and Hof Hoorneman Bankiers resulted in a net loss of \u20ac5.3 million in the line item Gains/losses on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. For further information, see Note 21, Other liabilities.\n\n| 29.

In certain cases, where a company has not been able to repay a corporate loan granted by Van Lanschot Kempen, the loan has been converted into a shareholding, thus giving the company time to recover. We aim to sell any shares in nonstrategic investments in due course.",

The partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden and the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers led to an increase in staff costs of \u20ac10.3 million. In addition, significantly better group financial performance led to \u20ac8.6 million higher variable remuneration and a one-off end-of-year payment (of \u20ac3,000 per employee) to all employees in the Netherlands (with a total impact of \u20ac4.4 million). Also, our staff numbers grew.\n\nIn 2021, share-based payments added \u20ac2.1 million to equity (2020: \u20ac1.6 million). Of the total expenses arising from share-based payments, \u20ac1.4 million is included in Salaries and wages (2020: \u20ac1.6 million). Pension costs for defined contribution schemes include \u20ac1.5 million for Management Board members (2020: \u20ac1.1 million).\n\nThe number of staff at year-end 2021 was 1,828 (2020: 1,801). The average number of staff in full-time equivalents was 1,696 (2020: 1,630), as shown below:\n\n| Average number of staff (FTEs) during the year   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total                                            | 1,696  | 1,630  |\n| Netherlands                                      | 1,484  | 1,444  |\n| Belgium                                          | 148    | 132    |\n| Other                                            | 65     | 53     |\n\nConditional depositary receipts for shares are granted to staff both under the variable remuneration policy for identified staff and the long-term share plan (LTP).\n\n| Conditional depositary receipts for shares granted to staff (excluding Management Board)   | 2021    | 2020    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| At 1 January                                                                               | 112,224 | 150,613 |\n| Granted                                                                                    | 43,994  | 46,696  |\n| Vested                                                                                     | -61,320 | -84,241 |\n| Forfeited rights                                                                           | -2,357  | -844    |\n| At 31 December                                                                             | 92,541  | 112,224 |\n\nThe fair value is determined based on the volume-weighted day price for depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares on the second trading day after release of Van Lanschot Kempen's annual figures. The fair value is equal to the share price less discounted value of expected dividends during the vesting period. Depositary receipts granted in 2021 had a weighted-average fair value of \u20ac16.41 (2020: \u20ac16.10).\n\nIn 2021, 8,096 conditional depositary receipts for shares were granted under the LTP to a number of senior managers other than members of the Management Board (2020: 10,296).\n\n## Long-term share plan\n\nThe long-term share plan allows us to award variable remuneration to certain key employees, including identified staff. It offers a special type of variable remuneration in which the total variable pay takes the form of depositary receipts for Class A Van Lanschot Kempen shares. For the LTP, 60% of the Van Lanschot Kempen shares are awarded immediately and unconditionally, while 40% are awarded conditionally over a period of three years for LTP plans\n\nbefore 2021. For LTP plans from 2021 onwards, 40% are awarded conditionally over a period of four years.\n\nConditional depositary receipts for shares will vest if:\n\n- (ii) Risks have been reviewed and no material, unforeseen risks have occurred; and\n- (i) Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position allows this in the year of vesting;\n- (iii) The individual has not left the company in the three or four-year period.\n\nConditional variable remuneration can be revised down if so prompted by risks and performances identified later (malus).\n\nEmployees do not receive any dividends during the vesting period. If an employee ceases to be employed by Van Lanschot Kempen within this period, their rights will be forfeited, except in limited circumstances judged on an individual basis.\n\nA part (around 50%) of the conditionally awarded depositary receipts is used to pay income tax.",

The transaction was effected by the transfer of 70% of the shares of Mercier Vanderlinden to Van Lanschot Kempen. Commitment was made to acquire the remaining 30% in two separate tranches in the first quarters of 2025 and 2026. This partnership is in line with our strategy and enables us to expand our wealth management services and reach critical mass in Belgium. The assets under management of Mercier Vanderlinden amounted to \u20ac3.8 billion at acquisition date. The assets acquired included Mercier Vanderlinden's client relationships, brand name and products and services. On 26 July 2021, Van Lanschot Kempen announced the completion of this transaction and took control. We consolidated Mercier Vanderlinden in our statement of financial position as at July 2021, as part of our Private Clients segment.\n\nThe table below sets out the allocation of the acquisition price to the fair value of the acquired assets (including any identifiable intangible assets), liabilities and contingent liabilities at the acquisition date. The identifiable intangible assets reflect the acquired client relationships and brand name. The goodwill is attributable to the future profitability of the acquired business in anticipation of synergies achieved from the business combination.\n\n| Mercier Vanderlinden (\u20ac million)                                  |   Fair value of  acquisition | Carrying amount  of acquisition   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                         |                          8.5 | 8.5                               |\n| Property and equipment                                            |                          0.7 | 0.7                               |\n| Intangible assets                                                 |                        105.3 | 0.1                               |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income |                          0.4 | 0.4                               |\n| Other assets                                                      |                          6.9 | 6.9                               |\n| Current tax assets                                                |                          2   | 2.0                               |\n| Deferred tax asset                                                |                          0.3 | 0.3                               |\n| Total identifiable assets                                         |                        124   | 18.9                              |\n| Subordinated loans                                                |                          0.8 | 0.8                               |\n| Other liabilities                                                 |                          1.2 | 1.2                               |\n| Current tax liabilities                                           |                          2.5 | 2.5                               |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                          |                         26.6 | 0.3                               |\n| Total identifiable liabilities                                    |                         31.1 | 4.8                               |\n| Total net assets                                                  |                         92.9 | 14.1                              |\n| Goodwill                                                          |                         76.7 |                                   |\n| Consideration                                                     |                        169.6 |                                   |\n\nThe consideration includes a contingent amount of \u20ac47.8 million related to the deferred consideration for the 30% remaining shares (\u20ac46.2 million) and for the earn-out agreements (\u20ac1.6 million) recognised under Other liabilities. As Mercier Vanderlinden was 100% consolidated with the recognition of a deferred contingent liability effective July 2021, its financial performance contributed to our 2021 statement of income.\n\nThe deferred contingent liability will be remeasured on reporting dates, based on the projected financial performance of Mercier Vanderlinden. The remeasurement at year-end 2021 resulted in an additional contingent liability of \u20ac6.5 million. See also Note 21, Other liabilities.",

We have included these under the headings 'Basis of consolidation' and 'Summary of significant accounting policies'.\n\n## Interests in subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated statement of financial position and statement of income comprise subsidiaries and entities in which Van Lanschot Kempen has control, but excludes the names of relatively minor subsidiaries and entities.\n\n| Subsidiaries (%)                                                         | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) AG                                    | 100    | 100    |\n| Kempen Finance BV                                                        | 100    | 100    |\n| Kempen Capital Management BV                                             | 100    | 100    |\n| Kempen Bewaarder BV                                                      | 100    | n/a    |\n| Kempen AM NL BV                                                          | 100    | n/a    |\n| Kempen & Co USA Inc.                                                     | 100    | n/a    |\n| Van Lanschot Participaties BV                                            | 100    | 100    |\n| Beheermaatschappij \"Orthenstraat\" BV                                     | 100    | n/a    |\n| BV Foton, Maatschappij tot beheer van industrie- en handelsondernemingen | 100    | n/a    |\n| BV Beleggingsmaatschappij De Gevulde Trom                                | 100    | n/a    |\n| Sapphire Investments BV                                                  | 100    | n/a    |\n| Beheers en Beleggings Compagnie Silva Ducis BV                           | 100    | n/a    |\n| Van Lanschot Mezzaninefonds II BV                                        | 100    | n/a    |\n| Vakan BV                                                                 | 100    | n/a    |\n| Quion 17 BV                                                              | 100    | 100    |\n| Efima Hypotheken BV                                                      | 100    | n/a    |\n| LansOg Beheer BV                                                         | 100    | n/a    |\n| Hof Hoorneman Bankiers NV                                                | 100    | 100    |\n| Mercier Vanderlinden Asset Management NV (70% stake)                     | 100    | n/a    |\n| Holowell Holding BV                                                      | n/a    | 93     |\n\n## Consolidated structured entities controlled by Van Lanschot Kempen\n\nWe consolidate the following structured entities:\n\n- -Van Lanschot Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Company 2 BV\n- -Van Lanschot Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Company BV\n\n## Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Programme (CPTCB)\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen established a CPTCB programme in March 2015. Investors have a dual recourse claim: initially against Van Lanschot Kempen, and, in the event of the bank's failure, against a pool of cover assets. In April 2015, the bank launched the first bond loan of \u20ac500 million (maturity of seven years: coupon of 0.275%). The second bond loan of \u20ac500 million was placed in March 2016 (maturity of seven years: coupon of 0.375%) and the third bond loan of \u20ac500 million was placed in February 2017 (maturity of ten years: coupon of 0.875%). All loans were placed with institutional investors.\n\n## Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Programme 2 (CPTCB2)\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen established a retained CPTCB programme in July 2019. In September 2019, the bank launched the first bond loan of \u20ac300 million (maturity of five years: coupon of 0.400%). All loans were retained.",

The Investments column shows the carrying value as recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has no other interests in nonconsolidated structured entities such as commitments, guarantees, provisions, derivatives or other obligations. The maximum exposure to non-consolidated structured entities is equal to the acquisition cost and amounted to \u20ac368.1 million at 31 December 2021 (2020: \u20ac355.2 million).\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is not required to provide financial or other support to non-consolidated structured entities, and has no intention of providing such support.\n\n|                         | Non-consolidated structured entities 2021   | Non-consolidated structured entities 2021   | Non-consolidated structured entities 2021   | Non-consolidated structured entities 2021   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                         | Interest income                             | Comprehensive income                        | Total income                                | Investments                                 |\n| Total                   | 306                                         | -1,979                                      | -1,037                                      | 364,082                                     |\n| Asset-backed securities | 306                                         | -1,979                                      | -1,037                                      | 364,082                                     |\n\n## Non-consolidated structured entities 2020\n\n|                         |   Interest income | Comprehensive income   | Total income   | Investments   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Total                   |               554 | -1,591                 | -1,037         | 351,968       |\n| Asset-backed securities |               554 | -1,591                 | -1,037         | 351,968       |\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe consolidated statement of financial position and statement of income include a number of non-controlling interests; a list of non-controlling interests in Van Lanschot Kempen subsidiaries is provided below.\n\n| Non-controlling interests     | 31/12/2021   |   31/12/2020 |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Total                         | 64           |          -73 |\n| Consolidated investment funds | 64           |           79 |\n| Consolidated shareholdings    | -            |         -151 |\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's minority interests are recognised under non-controlling interests as part of equity.",

Key to our strategy is the ability to adapt quickly to changing client needs and market circumstances. At the beginning of 2021, we fundamentally changed our organisational structure by moving from a business line-driven organisation towards an integrated model. This allows us to work across client groups, use a broader range of products and further improve the efficiency of our organisation.\n\nThis new organisational structure means that our segment reporting has also changed to client groups from 2021 onwards, these being Private Clients, Wholesale & Institutional Clients, Investment Banking Clients, and Other activities. Intersegment transactions between these operating segments are conducted on an arm's length basis and internal cost allocation is based on the use of services.\n\nThe operating segments have changed so significantly that the information to restate the corresponding information for earlier periods is not available and the cost to develop it would be excessive. Therefore, in line with IFRS 8, no comparative figures for year-end 2020 are made available.\n\n## Private Clients\n\nPrivate Clients offers private clients and entrepreneurs a broad range of products in the private banking market, while also focusing on business professionals and executives, healthcare professionals, family businesses, foundations and associations. The activities of Evi, Van Lanschot Kempen's online investment coach, are integrated in this segment and specifically target mass affluent individuals and Millennials.\n\n## Wholesale & Institutional Clients\n\nWholesale & Institutional Clients focuses on a range of investment strategies and offers fiduciary services to domestic and international clients such as banks, wealth managers, family offices, pension funds and insurers.\n\n## Investment Banking Clients\n\nInvestment Banking Clients offers specialist services including equities research and trading, mergers & acquisitions services, capital market transactions and debt advisory services to institutional investors, corporates, financial institutions and public and semi-public entities.\n\n## Other\n\nThese comprise activities in the fields of interest rate, market and liquidity risk management, structured products activities, staff departments, as well as the activities of Van Lanschot Participaties/Bolster and consolidated investments.\n\n| Operating segments in 2021  (\u20ac million)   |                 |                                    |                             |        |       |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|-------|\n|                                           | Private Clients | Wholesale &  Institutional Clients | Investment Banking  Clients | Other  | Total |\n| Statement of income                       |                 |                                    |                             |        |       |\n| Net interest income                       | 135.2           | 0.0                                | 0.0                         | 13.2   | 148.4 |\n| Income from securities and associates     | -               | -                                  | 2.7                         | 66.3   | 69.1  |\n| Net commission income                     | 244.3           | 81.4                               | 55.9                        | 4.4    | 386.0 |\n| Result on financial transactions          | -2.9            | 0.0                                | 2.1                         | -14.8  | -15.6 |\n| Other income                              | -               | -                                  | -                           | 10.6   | 10.6  |\n| Total income from operating activities    | 376.7           | 81.4                               | 60.7                        | 79.7   | 598.4 |\n| Staff costs                               | 93.6            | 10.1                               | 24.0                        | 156.9  | 284.5 |\n| Other administrative expenses             | 62.0            | 6.7                                | 8.3                         | 46.9   | 123.9 |\n| Allocated expenses                        | 106.2           | 54.2                               | 9.3                         | -169.7 | -     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | 11.2            | 0.8                                | 0.3                         | 17.1   | 29.4  |\n| Impairments                               | -10.6           | -                                  | -                           | -7.2   | -17.8 |\n| Total expenses                            | 262.3           | 71.8                               | 41.9                        | 43.9   | 420.0 |\n| Operating result before tax               | 114.3           | 9.6                                | 18.8                        | 35.8   | 178.5 |",

These balances cannot be used by Van Lanschot Kempen in its day-to-day operations.

The decrease in current tax assets is due to an increase in profit before tax, and the decrease in deferred tax assets is due to a decrease in losses, derivatives and the netting position.\n\nAccrued assets relate to interest receivables, commission receivables and transitory items.\n\nAll current receivables fall due in less than one year. The fair value of the receivables approximates the carrying amount due to their short-term nature and the fact that provisions for bad debt are recognised, where necessary.\n\n| 12.

The increase in Other liabilities is partly due to the contingent consideration regarding the partnership with Mercier Vanderlinden; please refer to the consolidated financial statements' 'Business combinations in 2021'. The increase was partly offset by the payment of purchase price of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers.\n\nLease liabilities stood at \u20ac46.4 million (2020: \u20ac50.7 million). Payments not included in the lease liability measurement amounted to -\u20ac0.1 million (2020: -\u20ac0.2 million).\n\nAccrued liabilities relate to interest payable and other accruals.\n\nThe decrease in issued debt securities is mainly explained by the sale and redemption of structured debt instruments. Issued debt securities from group companies stood at nil in 2021 (2020: nil).\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen NV forms a corporate income tax group with Van Lanschot Participaties 2 BV, Diezeland Holding BV ( in liquidation) , BV Beleggingsmaatschappij De Gevulde Trom, Beheermaatschappij 'Orthenstraat' BV, BV Foton, Maatschappij tot beheer van industrie en handelsondernemingen, Langosta BV, Van Lanschot Participaties BV, Van Lanschot Mezzaninefonds II BV ( in liquidation) , Beheers & Beleggings Compagnie Silva Ducis BV ( in liquidation) , Efima Hypotheken BV, Global Property Research BV, Kempen Finance BV, Kempen Capital Management NV, Kempen AM NL BV, Kempen Dutch Inflation Fund I NV, Quion 17 BV, Sapphire Investments BV, LansOG Beheer BV, Hof Hoorneman NV and Hof Hoorneman Fund Management NV.

In March 2020, the Court in Den Bosch ruled in favour of Van Lanschot Kempen. This ruling results in Van Lanschot Kempen being able to claim VAT from the Dutch tax authorities for the previous years (2014-20), which had already been paid. In August 2020, the Dutch tax authorities appealed against the ruling at the Supreme Court. In November 2021, we received the opinion of the Advocate General of the Supreme Court. The indicated time frame for the Supreme Court's ruling is now May-July 2022.\n\n## Foreign currency balance converted to euros\n\n## 21. Other notes to the statement of financial position\n\nThe sum of assets in foreign currencies converted to euros amounted to \u20ac240 million (2020: \u20ac216.7 million) and the sum of liabilities in foreign currencies to \u20ac834 million (2020: \u20ac537.8 million).\n\n## Contractual maturity of assets and liabilities\n\nThe tables below show the assets and liabilities based on their remaining contractual terms to maturity at the reporting date, without taking behavioural aspects into account.

This includes positions arising from group companies. The value of financial instruments at amortised cost is taken as the amount for which the instrument could be exchanged in a\n\ncommercial transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. If there is an active market, we use the market value to determine the fair value. For financial instruments for which no market prices are available, the fair values shown in the table are estimated on the basis of the present value or other estimation or valuation methods.\n\n| Financial instruments at amortised cost                 | 2021                                            | 2021     | 2021                                          | 2021             | 2021                       | 2021                                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                         | Carrying                                        | Carrying | 2020                                          | 2020             |                            |                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                                         | Fair value                                      | amount   | Fair value                                    | Carrying  amount | Valued using               | Valuation method                                                                                                                                     |\n| Assets                                                  |                                                 |          |                                               |                  |                            |                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Government paper eligible for central bank  refinancing | 226,357                                         | 223,112  | 236,360                                       | 227,781          | Listed market prices       | Listed market prices                                                                                                                                 |\n| Due from banks                                          | 195,918                                         | 196,500  | 332,251                                       | 332,415          | Observable market inputs   | Discounted cash flows using  applicable money market  rates                                                                                          |\n| Loans and advances to the public and private  sectors   | 9,095,340   8,849,639   8,520,343   8,321,997   |          |                                               |                  | Unobservable market inputs | Discounted cash flows using  current market fees for  comparable loans and taking  into account the  creditworthiness of the  counterparty           |\n| Debt instruments                                        |                                                 |          |                                               |                  |                            |                                                                                                                                                      |\n| -

For details of remuneration in 2021, see 'Remuneration of the Management and Supervisory Boards'.\n\n## 27.

The Stichting's policy is solely aimed at pursuing what is described in its objects clause as included in Article 2 of its Articles of Association ( statutaire doelomschrijving ). Its activities exclusively concern holding and managing shares in Van Lanschot Kempen; the Stichting does not engage in any commercial activities.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, at every Van Lanschot Kempen general meeting the Stichting grants a proxy to depositary receipt holders that either attend the meeting in person or are represented by a third party. In other words, depositary receipt holders can always vote at their own discretion for the number of shares for which they hold depositary receipts.\n\nIn 2021, the Stichting's activities consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Convening board meetings (at which the matters mentioned below were discussed);\n- \u00b7 Attending Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings; and\n- \u00b7 Granting proxies for Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings;\n- \u00b7 Exercising the voting rights on Van Lanschot Kempen shares held by the Stichting at Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings, to the extent that no proxies had been granted to depositary receipt holders.\n\nThe Stichting will continue to pursue its policies and activities in 2022 in accordance with its objects clause and in keeping with past practice.\n\nThe Stichting's income consists of an 'independence donation' paid by Van Lanschot Kempen. The costs incurred by the Stichting typically only consist of the remuneration due to its Board members and administrative charges (such as accountants' fees). As the Stichting does not have any discretionary funds, it has no policies in place related to such spending. The Board expects the Stichting's budget for 2022 to be similar to the budget (as well as the profit and loss account) for 2021.\n\nIn view of the nature of the activities of the Stichting and especially the fact that the Stichting does not conduct any commercial activities, the Stichting has not been directly impacted by the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Board is not aware of any indications and therefore has no expectation that the pandemic will in any way have an impact on the funding provided to the Stichting by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Board meetings\n\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's 2020 financial statements;\n\nIn 2021, the Board held three board meetings. The topics covered in these meetings included:\n\n- \u00b7 The state of affairs within Van Lanschot Kempen;\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's 2021 half-year results;\n- \u00b7 The agenda of the general meeting of Van Lanschot Kempen held on 27 May 2021 ('the AGM') and the Stichting's voting intentions;\n- \u00b7 The succession of the chairman of Van Lanschot Kempen's Management Board;\n- \u00b7 The succession of Mr J. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen as a member of the Board in 2022.\n- \u00b7 The agenda of the extraordinary general meeting of Van Lanschot Kempen held on 22 September 2021 ('the EGM') and the Stichting's voting intentions;\n\n## Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings\n\nThe Board attended the AGM and the EGM. The Stichting granted proxy votes to holders of depositary receipts for shares that attended these meetings in person or were represented by third parties. This enabled these depositary receipt holders to vote at their own discretion for the number of Class A ordinary shares corresponding to the depositary receipts of Class A ordinary shares held by them at record date. The Stichting voted, at its own discretion, on the Class A ordinary shares for which no proxy votes had been requested. Such shares represented 52.10% of the total number of votes that could be cast at the AGM and 55.77% of the total number of votes that could be cast at the EGM.\n\nThe Board carefully considered each of the items put to the ballot and after due consideration decided to vote in favour of all items put to the ballot. This included the remuneration report for the year 2020, the proposal for the legal merger between Van Lanschot Kempen NV and Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV and the proposal to appoint Ms Brigitte Boone as a member of the Supervisory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Composition of the Board\n\nThe Board's current members are:\n\nJ. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen, Chair C.M.P. Mennen-Vermeule, Secretary W.F. Hendriksen\n\nMr Meijer Timmerman Thijssen is a consultant with Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.\n\nMs Mennen-Vermeule is Chief Executive Officer at Brand Loyalty Group.\n\nMr Hendriksen is a partner at Van Doorne.\n\nThe annual remuneration of the Chair of the Board amounts to \u20ac10,000 (excluding VAT) and that of each other Board member to \u20ac7,500 (excluding VAT).",

The Stichting pursues its purpose by acquiring Class C preference shares in the capital of Van Lanschot Kempen, and by exercising the rights attached to these shares.\n\nThe Stichting and Van Lanschot Kempen have signed a call option agreement granting the Stichting the right to acquire Class C preference shares up to 100% of the value of Van Lanschot Kempen's share capital in issue before the exercise of the call option, less one share. When acquiring Class C preference shares, the Stichting is required to pay a minimum of 25% of the nominal amount. To ensure it will be able to pay when the time comes, the Stichting has a funding agreement with ING Bank in place. Van Lanschot Kempen aims to keep any period with outstanding Class C preference shares as brief as possible, and has committed itself to a maximum of one year as the term within which Van Lanschot Kempen will propose to the general meeting to redeem any Class C preference shares.\n\nThe Stichting's policy is exclusively aimed at pursuing the purpose as described above. The Stichting does not in any way engage in commercial activities, or any other type of activities as long as there are no circumstances that, pursuant to its objects clause, would give the Stichting cause to act and exercise its powers.\n\nIn 2021, the Stichting's activities consisted of convening a Board meeting as well as holding ad hoc consultations as and when required.\n\nThe Stichting's income consists of an 'independence donation' paid by Van Lanschot Kempen. The costs incurred by the Stichting typically only consist of a commitment fee due to ING Bank in relation to the funding agreement, the remuneration due to its Board members and administrative charges (such as accountancy fees). As the Stichting does not have any discretionary funds, it has no policies in place related to such spending. The Board expects the Stichting's budget for 2022 to be similar to the budget (as well as the profit and loss account) for 2021.\n\nIn view of the nature of the activities of the Stichting and especially the fact that the Stichting does not conduct any commercial activities, the Stichting has not been directly impacted by the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Board is not aware of any indications and therefore has\n\nno expectation that the pandemic will in any way have an impact on the funding provided to the Stichting by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Board meetings\n\nIn 2021, the Board convened for one meeting. Topics discussed at that meeting included:\n\n- \u00b7 The state of affairs within Van Lanschot Kempen;\n- \u00b7 The minutes of the Board meeting held in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's annual accounts for 2020;\n\n## Replacement of agreements (novation)\n\nKempen NV and Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV which became effective on 1 July 2021 (the merger) the Stichting was required to replace the call option agreement with Van Lanschot Kempen as well as the facility agreement with ING Bank. The agreements were replaced under the pre-existing terms and under the condition that the merger would come into effect. The merger came into effect on 1 July 2021 and therefore the new option agreement and facility agreement came into effect on 1 July 2021.\n\nIn connection with the legal merger between Van Lanschot\n\n## Composition of the Board\n\nA.A.M.

Credit risk under A-IRB is determined by using internal input for probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and maturity (M).\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nThe amount for which financial assets or liabilities are initially recognised less redemptions, plus or minus accumulated depreciation/amortisation using the effective interest rate method for the difference between the original amount and the amount at maturity date, less impairments or amounts not received.\n\n## Assets under administration (AuA)\n\nAssets which are entrusted by clients to Van Lanschot Kempen purely for custody or for which solely administrative services are performed. Clients take their own investment decisions, over which Van Lanschot Kempen has no influence.\n\n## Assets under discretionary management\n\nClient assets entrusted to Van Lanschot Kempen under a discretionary management agreement, irrespective of whether these assets are held in investment funds, deposits, structured products (Van Lanschot Kempen index guarantee contracts) or cash.\n\n## Assets under management (AuM)\n\nAssets deposited with Van Lanschot Kempen by clients, breaking down into assets under discretionary management and assets under non-discretionary management.\n\n## Assets under monitoring and guidance\n\nClient assets that are only subject to monitoring, plus minor advisory and related services. Clients make their own investment decisions and Van Lanschot Kempen has little or no influence on the management of these assets.\n\n## Assets under non-discretionary management\n\nClient assets held for clients by Van Lanschot Kempen, irrespective of whether these assets are held in investment funds, deposits, structured products (index guarantee contracts) or cash, with either a Van Lanschot Kempen investment adviser advising the client on investment policy or clients making their own investment decisions without Van Lanschot Kempen's input.\n\n## Basel III\n\nThe framework drawn up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which introduces a stricter definition of capital and several new ratios and buffers with which banks must comply.\n\n## Basel IV\n\nThe reform of Basel III, commonly referred to as 'Basel IV', involves the final calibration and design of capital output floors, based on revised standardised approaches. It also includes reforms of the IRB approach and the standardised approach for credit and operational risk.\n\n## Centraal Planbureau (CPB)\n\nCPB Netherlands' Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.\n\n## Capital conservation buffer\n\nCapital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) requires Van Lanschot Kempen to maintain Common Equity Tier 1 capital equivalent to 2.5 times total risk exposure as a capital conservation buffer. If an institution fails to maintain this capital conservation buffer, it will be restricted in making discretionary distributions.\n\n## Cash flow hedges (hedge accounting)\n\nInstruments to hedge the exposure to fluctuations in cash flows of assets, liabilities or future transactions, arising as a result of interest rate changes and/or inflation.\n\n## Client option positions\n\nClients are unable to buy or sell share options directly on the stock exchange. Van Lanschot Kempen purchases or sells on behalf of these clients and covers this with offsetting transactions on the stock exchange. Such receivables and payables are recognised under Derivatives.\n\n## Combined buffer requirements\n\nFrom 2016, subject to transitional provisions, institutions have been required to maintain capital buffers in addition to the own funds requirements contained in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). For Van Lanschot Kempen, the combined buffer requirement consists of the capital conservation buffer extended by the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer. The G-SII buffer, O-SII buffer and systemic risk buffer are not applicable to Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital\n\nAlso referred to as core capital. CET 1 capital encompasses a bank's share capital, share premium and other reserves, adjusted for deductions as specified by regulators, such as goodwill, deferred tax assets and IRB shortfall.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio\n\nCET 1 capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nAll commitments arising from transactions for which the bank has given a guarantee to third parties.\n\n## Countercyclical capital buffer\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital equivalent to the total risk exposure amount (calculated in accordance with the CRR) multiplied by the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates. The countercyclical buffer rates are set by the designated authority in each EU member state on a quarterly basis. The buffer is determined by calculating the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates that apply in the jurisdictions of the relevant credit exposures.",

        "page_content": "## Fair value hedges (hedge accounting)\n\nA fair value hedge comprises one or more swaps concluded to cover the changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, of debt securities, for example. Hedge relations are typically exact hedges, involving debt securities with fixed rates and terms being offset by swaps with exactly the same terms and fixed interest rates.\n\n## Fiduciary management\n\nHolding assets as a trustee or in another fiduciary role for individuals, trusts, pension providers and other institutions. These assets are not included in the consolidated financial statements because they are not Van Lanschot Kempen's assets.\n\n## Fitch\n\nCredit rating agency.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nMaking a concession regarding the terms and conditions of a loan agreement due to actual or anticipated financial difficulties which prevent a client from meeting its obligations vis-\u00e0-vis Van Lanschot Kempen.

Forward contracts are customised contracts traded on the OTC markets.\n\n## Foundation internal ratings-based approach (F-IRB)\n\nAn advanced credit risk measurement technique. Under FIRB, a bank is allowed to develop its own models, based on direct or indirect observations, to estimate parameters for calculating risk-weighted assets. Credit risk under F-IRB is determined by using internal input for probability of default (PD). In contrast to A-IRB, the loss given default (LGD) is included, based on prescribed values.\n\n## Funding ratio\n\nThe ratio between public and private sector liabilities and total loans and advances (excluding bank borrowing and lending).\n\n## Futures\n\nContractual obligations to purchase or sell goods or financial assets at a future date at a pre-agreed price.

        "page_content": "## Internal ratings-based approach (IRB)\n\nAn advanced approach used to calculate credit risk. Van Lanschot Kempen applies only the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach.\n\n## International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\n\nAccounting and reporting standards drawn up by the International Accounting Standards Board. These standards have been adopted by the European Union and have been applied by us from the 2005 financial year.\n\n## Irrevocable commitments\n\nAll obligations resulting from irrevocable commitments that could result in loans being granted.\n\n## KCM\n\nKempen Capital Management NV.\n\n## Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is based on the price at the reporting date (market price). The bid price is applied for financial assets and the offer price for financial liabilities. Since these instruments are traded in an active market, their prices adequately reflect current and frequent market transactions between unrelated parties.\n\n## Level 2: Inputs observable in the markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in active markets (e.g. over-the-counter financial derivatives) is established using cash flow and option valuation models. On the basis of its estimates, Van Lanschot Kempen selects a number of methods and makes assumptions based on the market conditions (observable data) at the reporting date.\n\n## Level 3: Significance of unobservable market data\n\nThe financial assets in this category have been assessed on an individual basis. Their valuation is based on management's best estimate by reference to the most recent prices, prices of similar instruments and, to a not insignificant extent, information not observable in the market.\n\n## Leverage ratio (LR)\n\nThe leverage ratio represents the relationship between total assets plus contingent items and the Basel III Tier 1 capital. It is calculated in accordance with the CRR.\n\n## Lifetime probability of default (LPD)\n\nSee \"Probability of default\".\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nThe LCR represents the ratio between high-quality liquid assets and the balance of cash outflows and cash inflows in the next 30 days.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe risk that the bank has insufficient liquid assets available to meet current liabilities in the short term.\n\n## Loss given default (LGD)\n\nThe loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising in the event of a default occurring at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including\n\nfrom the realisation of any collateral. It is typically expressed as a percentage of EAD.\n\n## Loss given loss (LGL) model\n\nA product-level model evaluating the part of exposure at default (EAD) that may be lost.\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe risk that the value of a financial position changes due to movements in stock exchange prices, foreign exchange and/or interest rates.\n\n## Morningstar\n\nMorningstar rates mutual funds and ETFs from 1 to 5 stars based on how well they have performed in comparison to similar funds and ETFs.\n\n## Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nThe relationship between available stable funding and the required amount of stable funding.\n\n## Non-performing loans (NPL)\n\nLoans are classed as non-performing if they meet one or more of the following criteria: 1) significant limit overrun for a period of more than 90 days; 2) a probability of default of 1; 3) a provision has been taken; 4) forborne exposures for which the two-year probation period has not started.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nThe risk of direct or indirect losses as a result of inadequate or defective internal processes and systems, inadequate or defective human acts, or external events.\n\n## Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nThe NPS provides information on client loyalty and the number of promoters of the organisation. The score lies within a range of -100 to 100 points, the higher the better. The formula is as follows: NPS = % promoters - % detractors. Promoters give the organisation a score of 9 or 10, whereas detractors award a score of between 0 and 6.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests in entities that are fully consolidated by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## OECD Guidelines\n\nThe OECD Guidelines describe what the Dutch government expects from multinational enterprises when it comes to corporate social responsibility. The Guidelines provide companies with guidance in the field of e.g. supply chain management, human rights, child labour, environment and corruption.\n\n## Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)\n\nThe Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) provide a framework for incorporating environmental, social and governance criteria in investment policies.\n\n## Probability of default (PD)\n\nThe probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. In our IRB models (Basel), this time horizon is one year. For IFRS 9 purposes, we use the one-year PD as well as the lifetime PD. A default may only happen at a certain time during the assessed period if the facility has not already been derecognised and is still in the portfolio.",

A provider of residential mortgages (typically a bank) will sell these on to a separate entity, a special purpose vehicle (SPV). To finance the mortgages, the SPV will then issue securities called RMBS, which are secured by the mortgages.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWA)\n\nThe assets of a financial institution after being adjusted by a weighting factor, set by its regulators, that reflects the relative risk attached to the relevant assets. Risk-weighted assets are used to calculate the minimum amount of capital the institution needs to hold. CRR/CRD IV uses the term 'total risk exposure amount' instead of RWA, but for now we follow common usage.\n\n## SEC-ERBA\n\nSecuritisation: External-ratings-based approach. Provided that securitisations meet operational requirements and have an external rating, the risk weight of a securitisation can be derived from, among other factors, the external rating, seniority and tranche maturity.\n\n## Settlement risk\n\nThe risk for financial transactions that are not settled within five days of the agreed deadline if the difference between the agreed settlement price and the price at the reporting date could lead to a loss.\n\n## Shortfall\n\nThe difference between the calculated expected loss (EL) and the provision made for a loan for which the capital adequacy requirement is calculated using the IRB method. If the calculated EL exceeds the provision made, the difference must be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital.\n\n## Solvency\n\nThe bank's buffer capital expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets.\n\n## Standard & Poor's\n\nCredit rating agency.\n\n## Standardised approach (SA)\n\nA method used under Basel to measure operational, market and credit risks, based on a standardised approach, in which risk weightings are prescribed by the regulators.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nCurrent or future threats to the bank's results or equity resulting from not or inadequately responding to changes in external factors and/or from taking incorrect strategic decisions.
