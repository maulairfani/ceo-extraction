In 2021, for the first time, the sustainability reporting was integrated into Nordea's Annual Report and therefore a separate Sustainability Report is no longer being published. Nordea's sustainability reporting for 2021 constitutes sustainability disclosures found (i) throughout the front section, but mainly in the Sustainable banking chapter on pages 28-40, (ii) in the Non-financial statement (incl. our taxonomy reporting) on pages 89-92, (iii) in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 66, (iv) on pages 160-162 in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management', and (v) in the Sustainability notes on pages 313-337, which provide in-depth information and data related to the sustainability disclosures. In addition, sustainability indices referring to our reporting in relation to the Principles for Responsible Banking, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, and the GRI Standards are published as a separate appendix available at nordea.com/sustainability. For more information on how we report on sustainability see Note S10 'About the sustainability disclosures' on page 335.\n\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views with respect to certain future events and potential financial performance. Although Nordea believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could di/ff.ligaer materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Important factors that may cause such a di/ff.ligaerence for Nordea include, but are not limited to: (i) the macroeconomic development, (ii) change in the competitive environment, (iii) change in the regulatory environment and other government actions and (iv) change in interest rate and foreign exchange rate levels. This report does not imply that Nordea has undertaken to revise these forward-looking statements,  beyond  what  is  required  by  applicable  law  or  applicable  stock exchange regulations if and when circumstances arise that lead to changes compared with the date when these statements were provided.",

        "page_content": "## Dear stakeholder ,\n\nWe want to be the preferred partner for customers in need of a broad range of financial services -  driving for a sustainable future. Our purpose remains to enable dreams and aspirations for a greater good.\n\nDespite the pandemic continuing in 2021, we saw many encouraging and positive developments throughout the year. Vaccination programmes progressed well and economic recovery was strong. Going forward, we may face further setbacks from new virus variants, but we are now more experienced in adjusting our way of living when needed.\n\nAt Nordea, we have continued to stand by our customers in these uncertain times, supporting the societies in which we operate. The fundamentals of our business are unchanged: everything we do starts and ends with our customers. Despite the pandemic, we have improved our ability to serve our customers in their preferred way. Customer satisfaction scores are stronger and customer complaints have decreased. We are now receiving 41% fewer complaints than three years ago.\n\nIn October 2019 we revised our strategic direction. With an updated business plan and ambitious financial targets for 2022, our aim was to retake lost ground in business, strengthening our customers' trust in us and improving our financial performance. We decided to focus on three key priorities: to create great customer experiences, drive income growth initiatives and optimise operational e/ffi.ligaciency. Most importantly, we resolved to put our customers at the centre of everything we did.\n\nIn the years to follow we prioritised developing our omnichannel model - being personal and available to our customers, whether they preferred to use our digital services or interact with us in person. We improved our customer experience and satisfaction scores and drove higher levels of customer activity, leading to increased business volumes.\n\nI'm happy about our progress. For us, 2021 was a milestone year. We maintained our strong performance and surpassed our 2022 financial targets one year ahead of schedule. All of our business areas met their respective targets as well.\n\nIn 2021 our return on equity was 11.2%, against a target of above 10%. Our cost-to-income ratio was 48%, against a target of 50%. During the year we continued to grow business and customer activity significantly, and further increased market shares across the Nordics.\n\nOur full-year 2021 operating profit was over EUR 4.9bn, which is 67% higher than in 2020, and our return on equity was up from 7.1% last year. Our mortgage lending grew by 6%, lending to small and medium-sized enterprises by 6% and assets under management by 17%, reaching all-time-high levels.\n\nWe could not have achieved these results without our skilled, passionate and very dedicated employees - I would like to thank all of them for their great e/ff.ligaorts. I'd also like to thank all our customers and shareholders for their very good cooperation over the past few years.\n\nOur strong capital base and credit quality give us the stability and credibility to support our customers and improve our performance even further. They also create predictability regarding shareholder value creation and returns.\n\nWe remain highly committed to implementing an e/ffi.ligacient capital structure. Our capital position is among the strongest in Europe, with a CET1 ratio of 17.0%, which is 6.8 percentage points above the regulatory requirement.\n\nOur aim is to deliver predictable and highly competitive returns for our shareholders. For 2021, our Board has proposed a dividend of approximately EUR 0.69 per share - a significant increase on the dividend of EUR 0.39 per share for 2020. This translates to a payout ratio of 70%, in line with our dividend policy. Dividends are important for our shareholders and support the Nordic societies by driving economic activity and growth.\n\nMeanwhile, share buy-backs are important for distributing excess capital and maintaining an e/ffi.ligacient capital structure. In February we received approval from the ECB for a further share buy-back of EUR 1bn.\n\nThe Annual Report often looks back to earlier achievements. We are proud of what we have accomplished, but now it is time to turn the page and take the next steps. We will move forward to deliver best-in-class omnichannel customer experiences, raise the bar on our financial performance and drive further value creation for our shareholders. We want to be the preferred partner for customers in need of a broad range of financial services.\n\nIn February we published our updated strategy and new financial target for 2025. We are targeting a return on equity above 13%. This will be supported by a cost-to-",

I am confident that with hard work we will meet it, just as we met our previous targets.\n\nWe have also set three key priorities for the coming years: to create the best omnichannel customer experience, drive focused and profitable growth, and increase operational and capital e/ffi.ligaciency.\n\nWe will continue to deliver great customer experiences with a firm focus on expert advisory and customer support. In 2021 we had more than 800,000 advisory sessions and over 1 billion digital engagements. We are committed to o/ff.ligaering the best omnichannel customer experience and being available 24 hours a day, every day of the year.\n\nInvestments and capital allocations will mainly focus on organic growth; strengthening digital capabilities, data and ESG areas; and meeting regulatory demands. We will remain open to selected bolt-on acquisitions when the right targets are available to support our strategy.\n\nWe will also optimise our business portfolio and manage our capital base e/ffi.ligaciently to pursue capital excellence and create value for our shareholders. In recent years we have managed to bring down costs considerably. We will continue to increase our operational e/ffi.ligaciency, build a strong cost culture and find further structural e/ffi.ligaciencies within the bank.\n\nTo support our business plan, we have decided to accelerate two key levers - digitalisation and sustainability. These will enable us to grow our business momentum and ensure that we stay relevant for our customers and well equipped for the future.\n\nNew technologies are accelerating digitalisation, and our customers appreciate the flexibility that our digital services o/ff.ligaer for their daily lives. In 2021 we had 3.1 million digitally active customers and 22% more monthly logins to our digital services than in 2020.\n\nWe will continue to make banking easy. We are moving towards enabling private customers to carry out daily banking tasks 100% digitally. At the same time, our digital capabilities will be complemented by the expertise of our 4,000 advisers.\n\nSustainability is at the core of our strategy - integrated into all aspects of our business, from our product o/ff.ligaering to our investment decisions to our internal operations. We have built up strong competence and capacity in this area and are well positioned to play a leading role in supporting our customers in the transition to net zero.\n\nWe have committed to become a bank with net-zero emissions by 2050. To reach this goal, we have set a long-term objective to reduce carbon emissions across our lending and investment portfolios by 40-50% by 2030.\n\nWe are taking decisive actions and continuing our step-by-step transition approach. In February we announced new 2025 sustainability targets, which focus on increasing positive impact while decreasing negative impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll of this, we will do in collaboration with our customers. We are continually developing and expanding our sustainability o/ff.ligaering in each of our four business areas to support the green transition. In 2021 total green lending grew to EUR 9.7bn, investor demand for our ESG savings products remained high, and we continued to be the top-ranking bank for Nordic sustainable bonds. We were again ranked among the top 100 most sustainable corporations in the world by Corporate Knights - the only Nordic bank in the ranking.\n\nTo succeed in our sustainability ambition, we support international initiatives such as the Principles for Responsible Banking and the UN Global Compact, and remain committed to them.\n\nIn 2021 we delivered what we promised - again. By focusing on our customers and executing our business plan, we implemented a cultural change that made Nordea's change of direction and improved performance a reality.\n\nWhile we have a new target and an updated business plan, our direction as a bank is not going to change. Our purpose remains to enable dreams and aspirations for a greater good.\n\nFor more than 200 years, we've played a key role in supporting our customers and developing the Nordic societies.\n\nThat will be our role going forward as well.\n\nBest regards, Frank Vang-Jensen President and Group CEO\n\n.",

We aim to provide the best possible support for customers transitioning to a more sustainable future, and actively contribute to society to benefit the greater good.\n\nAs a leading bank in the Nordic region, we have the capacity to support the ongoing transition to net zero via our customer o/ff.ligaering, through our lending and investment decisions, and by reducing the emissions from our internal operations.\n\nIn recent years we have focused heavily on enhancing sustainability within our daily operations, customer solutions and advisory o/ff.ligaerings. We reached a significant milestone in 2021 with the announcement of our 2030 and 2050 objectives and medium-term targets.\n\nWe then took another major step, launching a new longterm plan to fully integrate sustainability into our business strategy. Our work rests on four strategic pillars: financial strength, climate action, social responsibility, and governance and culture. The pillars draw on both the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement.\n\nThis year, we have taken the natural step of integrating our Sustainability Report into our Annual Report. Further details regarding our progress under the four pillars can therefore be found on pages 28-40 within this report.",

Our financial strength enables us to act on our responsibilities e/ff.ligaectively, supporting customers and society in both good and challenging times. We help protect our financial position by managing risks related to environmental, social and governance areas.\n\n## Climate action\n\nWe achieve our most positive climate impact through our decisions, actions and financial advice, together with our customers. We continually seek ways to minimise the climate impact of our internal operations.

To succeed, we are addressing key global megatrends that impact our  business.\n\nThe Nordic countries in which we operate - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden - consistently rank among the highest performing nations on metrics such as income, wealth, purchasing power, productivity, digitalisation, educational standards and more.\n\nAll four are politically stable democracies, which creates a very stable business environment. From a global perspective, the Nordics have very low rates of corruption and high legal protection of individual and property rights. Their solid welfare systems provide universal access to healthcare, education and social protection. Economic growth is strong, household savings are high and unemployment is low.\n\nThe Nordic region is a mature, digitalised and attractive market. Accordingly, it is a highly competitive business environment. Having the best products and services is not enough: the strongest financial institutions are digitally advanced, provide holistic advice to meet complex needs, adhere to the highest ethical standards and actively contribute to society and a sustainable future. This is what we strive for at Nordea.\n\n## Accelerated digitalisation in the wake of COVID-19\n\nThe world is digitalising at an increasingly fast rate, spurred on by new disciplines and technologies such as machine learning, cloud computing and blockchains.\n\n## A structurally attractive banking environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Nordea, we know that enhancing our digital o/ff.ligaering will be key to delivering on our 2025 business priority to create the best omnichannel customer experience.

Customer uptake of our digital solutions further increased, with 7% more customers using the mobile bank than a year ago and increased inflows through digital channels.\n\nOur speed and availability drove strong business momentum in mortgages, resulting in higher market shares across the Nordics.

To help our customers manage their finances digitally, we added new functionalities in the netbank and mobile app. For example, we extended our account aggregation service to customers in Finland, enabling them to get an overview of all their accounts, including those outside Nordea.\n\nOur customers are increasingly aware of sustainability issues and interested in making an impact through their savings. During the year we provided 2,300 advisers across the Nordics with dedicated training in sustainability areas, enabling them to better support customers in making sustainable choices. Our green mortgage lending portfolio grew by 55%, year on year, primarily in Sweden, further demonstrating customer interest in our sustainability o/ff.ligaering.

Mortgage volumes grew by 6% in local currencies.\n\nNet interest income increased by 8%, driven by the cross-Nordic mortgage volume growth, higher deposit margins in Denmark and higher mortgage margins in Finland. This development was partly o/ff.ligaset by lower mortgage margins in Norway resulting from rate changes and lower lending margins in Denmark due to a changed product mix.\n\nNet fee and commission income increased by 14%, driven by higher savings and investment income across all countries. Payment and card fee income also improved, in tandem with the reopening of societies. Our lending fee business performed strongly throughout the year, enabling us to fully compensate for the higher mortgage conversion activity in Denmark in 2020.\n\nNet result from items at fair value decreased by 24%, year on year, due to changes to income recognition principles for collar loans in Finland which took e/ff.ligaect in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 2%, year on year, mainly due to higher depreciation and amortisation and exchange rate e/ff.ligaects. These were partly o/ff.ligaset by lower sta/ff.liga costs and back-end costs.\n\nNet loan losses and similar net result decreased significantly, year on year, due to the additional management judgement allowances booked in the second quarter of 2020.

We also provide services to customers across the Nordea Group through the product and specialist units Markets and Investment Banking & Equities, and our international corporate branches in New York, Shanghai and London.\n\n## Business development\n\nIn 2021 we continued to demonstrate the e/ff.ligaectiveness of our business repositioning. We improved return on capital at risk (ROCAR) to 15% from 7% through higher income, lower loan losses and reduced capital.\n\nWe actively supported our customers while pursuing our strategy to focus on capital-light business selection. In the fourth quarter lending volumes remained stable, year on year, lending margins increased and Nordeaarranged corporate bond volumes increased by 20%, year to date.\n\nThroughout the year we had very high levels of customer activity, especially in Investment Banking & Equities. In Debt Capital Markets this was reflected in alltime-high bond issuance volumes. We carried out more than 430 primary bond transactions for corporate and institutional issuers, supporting record-high revenues. In equity capital markets and mergers and acquisitions we had a busy year with even higher volumes than in the strong 2020 period, and continue to hold leading market positions across the Nordic region.\n\nSignificant transactions with our involvement included the initial public o/ff.ligaerings of Aker Horizons and Kjell & Company, CVC's acquisition of STARK Group and Castellum's public o/ff.ligaer for Kungsleden.\n\nMarkets had another strong year, with high levels of customer activity generating solid returns. Markets' results also reflected income growth driven by investment securities and our continued focus on operational e/ffi.ligaciency.\n\nOur sustainability focus increasingly permeates everything we do. In 2021 we again ranked first for Nordic sustainable bonds overall, where we held a 14% market share. Our commitment to sustainability-linked financing was reflected in an ever-growing number of structuring and coordination mandates entrusted to us by our clients.\n\nWe expanded our sustainability o/ff.ligaering with cost-e/ffi.ligacient structured products and integrated ESG ratings into our credit research. We also updated our Sector Guideline for the Fossil Fuel-based Industries with stricter requirements and continued to support large corporate customers in designing low carbon transition plans. To strengthen our sta/ff.liga's sustainability competencies we ran an extensive internal training programme throughout the year.\n\nCustomer satisfaction remained high. In the 2021 Prospera survey we increased our corporate banking customer satisfaction scores in all four Nordic countries and ranked number one in Norway for the third time in five years. We also maintained number one positions for acquisition finance and corporate syndicated loans for the fifth and third year in a row, respectively. In Euromoney's 2021",

The new fund complements the Nordea 1 - Global Climate & Environment Fund, which is one of the largest Article 9 funds in Europe.

Our work rests on four strategic pillars: financial strength, climate action, social responsibility, and governance and culture. The pillars draw on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - 12 of which we consider to be particularly significant for us - and the Paris Agreement.\n\nUnder each pillar, we are focusing on relevant SDGs and sustainability topics that impact us or that we can have a significant impact on - by reducing the negative impact or increasing the positive impact of our business activities and internal operations.\n\nFor the pillar climate action, we have set 2030 and 2050 objectives and medium-term targets. For the other three pillars, we have set medium-term targets. The targets and objectives were approved by the Group Leadership Team in November 2020 and by the Board in December 2020.\n\nThis year, we revised and further strengthened our targets and the Board decided to include environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets in executive remuneration programmes. We also revised and strengthened our sustainability governance model so as to be able to execute our strategic sustainability agenda as e/ff.ligaectively as possible.\n\nOur sustainable banking work and four strategic pillars are presented on the coming pages. Targets, supplementary information and data related to the disclosures are presented in Note S1 'Financial strength', Note S2 'Climate action', Note S3 'Social responsibility', and Note S4 'Governance and culture'. More information on the SDGs is presented in Note S6 'Materiality and impact analysis'.\n\n## Supporting our customers in the transition\n\nOver the past couple of years we have seen a significant increase in the uptake of our sustainability o/ff.ligaering, accelerated by customer demand and the growing strength of our product range and guidance.\n\nWith our long and solid experience with sustainabilitylinked lending, ESG investment products and active ownership, we are well placed to accelerate our customers' transition to a greener future. Within all of these areas we aspire to be a leading voice.\n\nAs a relationship bank, our overall strategy is to engage with our customers and support their transition in close dialogue with them. Where customers are not able or willing to transition, we need to reduce our engagement and exposure.\n\n## Sustainability o/ff.ligaering: 2021 developments\n\nIn 2021 we further developed and expanded our sustainability o/ff.ligaering in each of our four business areas.\n\nIn Personal Banking we provided 2,300 advisers across the Nordics with dedicated training in sustainability areas, enabling them to support customers with the best\n\npossible advice in relation to sustainability-themed savings. We also released a new loan product in Sweden for sustainable house renovation.\n\nIn Business Banking we launched green loans at reduced rates for small and medium-sized enterprises in Finland and Sweden in collaboration with the European Investment Fund. In Norway, we began piloting our green deposits solution, which gives larger customers the opportunity to invest their excess liquidity while helping to finance our green lending.\n\nIn Large Corporates & Institutions we engaged with customers on sustainability-linked financing and supported large corporates in designing low carbon transition plans. We also launched our first green securities finance loan for corporate customers.\n\nIn Asset & Wealth Management we introduced several new sustainability-themed products, including our Global Climate and Social Impact Fund, which o/ff.ligaers customers the opportunity to get attractive returns while helping to fund solutions to the world's most pressing social problems.\n\nFor more details on our sustainability o/ff.ligaering, see Note S5 'Sustainability o/ff.ligaering'.\n\n'Our work rests on four strategic pillars: financial strength , climate action , social responsibility and governance and culture .'\n\n<!-- image -->",

Managing our exposure to these risks is a natural part of our daily operations and often requires us to take a long-term perspective.\n\nWe take into account ESG issues that could a/ff.ligaect us in both the short and longer term, directly or indirectly.

ECB Banking Supervision has developed a guide on the safe and prudent management of these risks under the current prudential framework.\n\nWe are well prepared to meet the ECB expectations. In tandem with our overall strategic sustainability agenda, we are developing a comprehensive approach to identifying, assessing, responding to and disclosing ESG-related risks in line with supervisory and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Managing ESG-related risks in our financing\n\nWe have a well-diversified lending portfolio, evenly split between corporate and household customers.\n\nFor corporate borrowers, we have processes in place to identify and evaluate ESG-related risks, and continue to develop these to ensure we make informed decisions. We perform di/ff.ligaerent types of ESG assessments depending on the size and type of the transaction and the customer's internal segmentation. We integrate identified ESG-related risks into the credit risk assessment if material, and conclude on the customer's risk level in a credit memorandum. Approvals are made according to the established credit decision-making process. For customers associated with a high level of ESGrelated risk, decisions are escalated to higher-level credit committees as relevant.\n\nIn the household sector the main ESG-related risks are within mortgage lending, where energy e/ffi.ligaciency and physical hazard risks are our focus areas. We are preparing to embed these risk elements into our mortgage process.",

To achieve this aim, carbon emissions must be halved by 2030 and on a path to net zero by 2050 at the latest.\n\nAs a financial institution, we are an important part of this transition. It is primarily through our business which represents the majority of our total carbon emissions - that we can make the most impact.\n\nThrough our financing, we are exposed to several climate-vulnerable sectors and have prioritised our work depending on the level of financed emissions and climate risk associated with each. On the investment side, we are challenging the same sectors, through our investment policies and strategies, to transition towards net-zero emissions.\n\nOur business objectives are to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest and, by 2030, to reduce the carbon emissions across our lending and investment portfolios by 40-50% relative to our 2019 baseline.\n\nAlthough our greatest impact on the climate is through financing and investments, we also work to reduce the climate impact of our internal operations. We have a long-term objective to reduce carbon emissions from internal operations by more than 50% by 2030 and by 30% by 2023, compared with 2019.\n\n## Towards net-zero emissions\n\nTo support our commitment to climate action, we are a co-founder and signatory to several UN-convened climate initiatives requiring concrete and timebound actions to align lending and investment portfolios with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nFor a full list of our external commitments and collaborations, see nordea.com/sustainability.\n\n## Measuring our financed emissions\n\nTo support our target-setting and deliver on our longterm objectives, we joined the PCAF - the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials - in December 2020 and have expanded our carbon accounting to cover our\n\nfinanced emissions. This year, we disclosed financed emissions for business loans for oil and gas exploration and production, business loans to the shipping sector, and investments in listed equity and real estate. We also disclosed the carbon footprint for investments in listed equity, corporate bonds and real estate.\n\nWhile improvements in data quality are dependent on broader data enhancements - by our customers, stakeholders and regulators - in line with the European sustainable finance agenda, our e/ff.ligaorts to measure our financed emissions continue. In 2021 we increased our data procurement and own sourcing of client-level data. Furthermore, we developed a climate risk assessment tool in order to assess transition risks and, from 2022, physical risks for our corporate customers in climate-vulnerable sectors.\n\n## Lending portfolio\n\nIn 2021 we became a signatory to the newly launched NetZero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and were a signatory to the Collective Commitment to Climate Action (CCCA). Through our involvement in these initiatives, we have co-developed guidelines supporting a harmonised approach to climate target-setting among CCCA and NZBA members.\n\nWe have already started to adopt the guidelines for climate-vulnerable sectors, with a 2021-24 time frame, as an integral part of our Group ESG implementation programme. As a first step, we have prioritised sectors according to the level of financed emissions and climate risk associated with each. We have also updated our business environment scan, covering the most relevant climate policy frameworks and sector decarbonisation roadmaps in the Nordic region at a more granular level.\n\nWe have identified the following sectors as potentially vulnerable to transition risk and therefore requiring deep dive assessments: oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore; shipping; mining and supporting activities; utilities distribution and waste management; power production; materials; paper and forest products; animal husbandry; fishing and aquaculture; crops plantation and hunting; air transportation; land transportation; capital goods; construction; and real estate management.",

The deep dives involved quantifying financed emissions and assessing customers' alignment with the anticipated greenhouse gas emissions reduction pathway required to fulfil our sustainability targets and objectives. The aim was to identify climate-related transition risks and opportunities in these sectors in preparation for setting sector targets in the coming years. The definitions of these sectors are as applied in our credit risk appetite framework. The total exposure to the three sectors amounted to EUR 6,775m or 5% of total corporate loans at the end of 2021.\n\n## Nordea Asset Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment portfolio\n\nOn the investment side, we participate in climate-related joint e/ff.ligaorts through the Net-Zero Asset Manager Initiative and the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, to which NAM and NLP are a co-founder and signatory, respectively. During 2021 we set targets to reduce the carbon footprint from NAM's and NLP's portfolios.\n\nSo far on our journey towards meeting our 2030 objectives and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, indicative figures show that we/uni00A0have managed to reduce our carbon footprint for listed equities by 18% in NAM and reduce our carbon footprint for listed equities, corporate bonds and real estate in NLP by 25.9% compared\n\n## Nordea Life & Pension\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe bar charts show financed emissions in listed equity for di/ff.ligaerent sectors, including investees' scope 1 and 2 emissions (see details in Note S2 'Climate action').",

We reduced the total weighted average carbon intensity for assets managed by NAM by 15% and for NLP-managed assets by 18.8% between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021.\n\n## Supporting and challenging sector responsibility\n\nWe have described our commitments regarding climate change in our Position Statement on Climate Change. The Statement explains our stance towards sectors such as thermal coal, coal mining and oil sand extraction.\n\nWe also have guidelines addressing the climate issue and our position in relation to other sectors, including agriculture, forestry, fossil fuels, mining and real estate. With these guidelines, we aim to support and challenge customers to take responsibility and make the transition needed to fulfil the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn 2021 we updated our Sector Guideline for the Fossil Fuel-based Industries. We have implemented several exclusions and established phase-out policies for companies using thermal coal for power production or mining; companies active in the area of unconventional oil and gas extraction, including pipeline infrastructure; and companies active in the most sensitive areas of the Arctic region. Our Sector Guideline for the Fossil Fuel-based Industries can be found at nordea.com/sustainability, together with all our other position statements and sector guidelines.\n\n## Being a responsible investor\n\nOn the investment side, we are committed to integrating ESG factors into our analysis, decision-making processes and active ownership practices.\n\nAll NAM funds are managed according to NAM's Responsible Investment Policy. In 2021 we expanded the scope of NAM's fossil fuel policy to include even more of our funds. The policy requires fossil fuel companies to demonstrate that they have a decarbonisation strategy consistent with global warming of 2\u00b0C or lower to be eligible for inclusion. Currently, 66% of our funds, expressed as a share of AuM, are subject to the policy.\n\nOur engagement with investee companies includes proxy voting in line with our in-house ownership policy. We exercise our right to influence the companies in which our funds have invested capital through voting at shareholders' annual general meetings (AGMs). As an example, a shareholder resolution for ExxonMobil to describe how its lobbying activities were aligned with the Paris Agreement, which was co-filed by NAM, received majority support at the company's AGM in May 2021. In 2021 we voted at around 4,200 general meetings and achieved a voting frequency of over 95% for our holdings. We show how we have voted in our voting portal at nordea.com.\n\nWe also engage directly with companies in portfolios managed on behalf of customers, especially where we identify a need for them to improve their  management of\n\nESG-related risks. In 2021 we engaged in 917 dialogues to ensure that the companies in question were adequately managing material ESG-related risks or taking full advantage of ESG opportunities.\n\nIn 2021 we strengthened NLP's governance and policy framework for ESG areas and climate change and issued a new Responsible Investment Policy and new Climate Change Policy. We also communicated our requirement for all asset managers managing assets on behalf of NLP to commit, no later than 2024, to transition their AuM to net zero by 2050 in order to continue managing assets on behalf of NLP. By the end of 2021 28% of all asset managers in scope had committed.\n\n## Our internal carbon footprint\n\nOur work to reduce the climate impact from our internal operations stems from the precautionary principle. So far on our journey towards meeting our carbon reduction targets we have managed to reduce carbon emissions from our internal operations by 73% compared with our 2019 baseline. The reduction was mainly due to our travel policy, employees working from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced heating and cooling emissions. After the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted we expect the emissions to increase in some areas but believe we are on track towards achieving a 30% reduction by 2023 and a 50% reduction by 2030.\n\nDespite our best e/ff.ligaorts to limit our internal carbon footprint, some emissions still remain di/ffi.ligacult to reduce. For these, we purchase carbon o/ff.ligasets to reduce equivalent emissions elsewhere. We supported the generation of renewable energy through the purchase of carbon credits for 2021. We will continue to fully o/ff.ligaset residual emissions from our internal operations. Going forward, we will shift to a long-term carbon removal portfolio, which we will periodically review to align with evolving best practices for achieving net-zero emissions.\n\n## Climate impact in our supply chain\n\nTo successfully reduce our climate impact, we also actively work with our suppliers, as an important part of our emissions occur upstream in our supply chain. Climate action is therefore a strategic focus area when it comes to our sourcing practices.\n\nIn 2021 we took several actions to further embed climate action into our supplier selection process. We are now screening all suppliers on carbon intensity, enabling us to engage early on to ensure our key suppliers are on a trajectory towards decarbonisation. In addition, we are integrating sustainability criteria into the business case and supplier selection process for selected supplier categories.\n\nTo ensure that our procurement contributes to fulfilling the objectives of the Paris Agreement, our e/ff.ligaorts to include climate issues in our sourcing process will continue in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Social responsibility\n\nBy considering human rights, labour rights, employment, gender equality and education, we aim to create social impact where it matters the most.\n\n## Integrating social issues into our business\n\nFor us, social responsibility is about taking sustainability issues such as human rights, labour rights, employment, gender equality and education into consideration in everything we do. This is instrumental to ensuring the long-term sustainability of our operations, fulfilling our purpose to contribute to a greater good, and protecting our customer relationships.\n\nWe take opportunities to increase our customers' awareness regarding social impact through our advice and o/ff.ligaerings. For example, our recently launched Global Climate and Social Impact Fund directly invests in companies that provide solutions to both social and environmental issues.\n\nMoreover, we address human rights, labour rights and other ESG issues in a range of due diligence processes including investing, financing, transactions and sourcing.\n\nWe include human rights in the norm-based screening of all our funds and as at December 2021 had ten companies on our exclusion list due to violations of human rights-related norms, including violations of the rights of indigenous peoples. In the event that we identify human rights violations for a customer, we will take action to review their credit assessment. We consider human rights when monitoring customer transactions for a wide range of behaviours that could be indicative of potential financial crime risk. We also integrate human rights risks into our supplier screening and monitoring processes, where we evaluate indicators such as the risk of child labour, the risk of modern slavery, the right to freedom of association, and the decency of working conditions.\n\n## Societal contributions\n\nSocial responsibility is also about supporting the societies in which we operate. In 2021 we partnered with Pride in several countries and signed the European Diversity Charter. We also celebrated European Diversity Month in May, with daily local and Group-wide activities aimed at raising awareness and encouraging discussion.\n\nCommunity engagement at Nordea is about creating positive change through our employees too. Through well over 20 programmes and partnerships, we focus on building financial skills and fostering entrepreneurship, thus enabling our banking and financial expertise to have a positive impact on society. With most of our activities based on face-to-face interaction, varying degrees of lockdown impacted our e/ff.ligaorts in 2021. Despite this, close to 1,100 Nordea employees delivered 6,500 hours of volunteering in 2021, which is in line with the 2020 level and at around 25% of the 2019 level.\n\n## Our people\n\nOur ability to grow sustainably depends on the people we attract, retain and develop, and the extent to which we provide an inclusive environment.\n\n## Diversity makes us better\n\nWe have a broad definition of diversity and aim to attract and retain people with a variety of backgrounds, experience and traits. In 2021 we developed a new strategy, including targets, to strengthen diversity and inclusion further. All business areas and Group functions have established action plans with respect to their own business, focusing on inclusive recruitment practices, inclusive leadership training and stronger external diversity commitment.\n\nOur Group-level Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Committee has been essential in developing our D&I ambitions and plays a key role in reinforcing the importance of D&I within Nordea. The Committee ensures the requisite anchoring among senior leadership, business areas, Group functions and workplaces. Furthermore, our Employee Resource Groups - voluntary, employee-led groups - support increasingly diverse perspectives and further foster inclusive workplaces.",

We are one of six founding banks of the joint venture Invidem, which is now rolling out a Nordic platform for know your customer (KYC) data. Establishing such a platform for handling KYC information, with standardised processes and datasets, means we can trust and use the information as a foundation for our own risk assessments, while also o/ff.ligaering a better customer experience.\n\n## Compliance is fundamental to our corporate culture\n\nBeing compliant means conducting business in accordance with financial laws; regulations; market standards; rules of conduct; data protection laws and other customer protection-related regulations relevant to our licensed activities; and supervisory requirements and related internal rules - while always respecting the principles of integrity and fair dealing.\n\nWe fully recognise the threat that societies face from human tra/ffi.ligacking, terrorism, corruption, drug smuggling, tax evasion and other forms of illegal activity and do our best to ensure that our resources, products and services are not used to facilitate financial crime.\n\nTracking down and stopping the flow of money from these activities is a key way to disrupt the criminals involved. Therefore, as a financial institution, we are uniquely positioned to be part of the solution. We commit to complying with the laws and regulations relevant to anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, sanctions, and antibribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nFor detailed information on compliance risks, see Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\n## Paying taxes responsibly\n\nTaxes play an important role in society's ability to fulfil its goals, including the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, by helping to finance public services in areas such as healthcare, infrastructure, social security, education, the judiciary, emergency services and defence.\n\nOur policy is to pay taxes in accordance with local regulations in all countries in which we operate and thereby make an appropriate contribution to each society. We manage tax expenses and risks prudently and aim to maintain a good local tax reputation by paying and reporting taxes in a timely manner.\n\nAs part of our advice and product information, we provide our customers with general information about the tax consequences of their decisions. To guide us in advising customers on tax matters, we have - in addition to our own tax policy - a tax policy regarding customers.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nOur supply chain is an important part of our footprint, and we expect our suppliers to actively contribute to the sustainability agenda. We spend around EUR 2bn annually on suppliers and sustainability within the supply chain is largely dependent on their actions and maturity.\n\nWe set appropriate standards and outline expectations in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which is included in our supplier agreements. The Supplier Code of Conduct is aligned with the Nordea Code of Conduct and the UN Global Compact. We expect our suppliers not only to abide by the laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, but also to display behaviours which go beyond compliance requirements.\n\n## Being a responsible buyer\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a large impact in 2021, causing many companies, including our smaller suppliers, to struggle with di/ffi.ligacult financial situations and liquidity shortages. We therefore upheld our decision, made in April 2020, to disregard our regular contractual payment terms and pay invoices as soon as they were registered and approved in our central payment system. This meant that invoices were paid on average 17 days prior to the due date.",

Total expenses were unchanged at EUR 4,649m, in line with guidance. Net loan losses decreased from last year to a level of 1bp (35bp in 2020). Operating profit was up 67%.\n\n## Income\n\n## Net interest income\n\nNet interest income increased by 9%. The main drivers were increased SME and mortgage lending volumes, as well as improved lending margins in Large Corporates & Institutions. Nordea Finance Equipment (NFE) also contributed positively, as did exchange rate e/ff.ligaects, which had a positive impact of approximately EUR 142m.\n\n## Lending volumes\n\nLoans to the public excluding repurchase agreements and securities borrowing were up 5% in local currencies. Lending volumes increased in local currencies in Personal Banking (6%), Business Banking (6%) and Large Corporates & Institutions (1%).\n\n## Deposit volumes\n\nTotal deposits from the public excluding repurchase agreements and securities lending were up 12% in local currencies. Deposit volumes increased in local currencies in Personal Banking (4%), Business Banking (11%) and Large Corporates & Institutions (25%).\n\n## Net fee and commission income\n\nNet fee and commission income increased by 18%. The main driver was growth in net income from savings and investments following AuM growth as well as high customer activity.\n\nPayment and card fee income also contributed positively, having increased from the subdued levels seen during most parts of 2020. Lending-related fees were also up compared with 2020.\n\n## Net result from items at fair value\n\nNet result from items at fair value increased by 24%, mainly driven by strong customer activity and also supported by higher investment valuations in Treasury. This was partly o/ff.ligaset by a lower Markets result.\n\n## Equity method and other operating income\n\nIncome from companies accounted for under the equity method was EUR -6m, down from EUR -1m. Other operating income was EUR 87m, down from EUR 93m.\n\n## Expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses were unchanged compared with 2020. Costs were in line with earlier communicated levels. Sta/ff.liga costs were also unchanged. Other expenses were down 5%. Depreciation was up 10%.\n\n## Sta/ff.liga costs and FTEs\n\nSta/ff.liga costs, significant agreements with key management personnel and the distribution by number of employees, by country and by gender are disclosed in Note G8. More information is presented in 'Our people' on page 324.\n\n## Profit sharing and share-based incentive systems\n\nThe goals for the Profit Sharing Plan 2021 are: return on equity, cost-to-income ratio and customer satisfaction. If performance goals are fully met, the cost will amount to approximately EUR 69m (EUR 63m in 2020). The provision for Nordea's Profit Sharing Plan 2021 was EUR 62.1m compared with EUR 32.4m in 2020. The Profit Sharing Plan and the share-based incentive systems as well as other remuneration principles are presented in the chapter \"Remuneration\" on pages 83-87 and in Note G8.",

        "page_content": "## Net loan losses and similar net result\n\nNet loan losses for 2021 were low at EUR 118m (EUR 908m), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 4bp for amortised cost. Including fair value gains on the Danish mortgage portfolio of EUR 83m, they amounted to EUR 35m, corresponding to 1bp (26bp). The net loan losses were related to stage 3, whereas there were reversals in stages 1 and 2 during the year reflecting strong credit quality. The individual provisions were coming from a number of industries with some concentration in Oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore as well as Retail trade. EUR 40m of the management judgement was released during the year to cover a few individual provisions as well as improvements made to the IFRS 9 ECL model. The main part of the management judgement reserve of EUR 610m remains in place for expected future losses.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating profit increased by 67% to EUR 4,936m, driven by growth in total income and lower loan losses.\n\n## Taxes\n\nThe e/ff.ligaective tax rate in 2021 was 22.4% compared with 23.6% last year. The main reason behind the decrease in the e/ff.ligaective tax rate is true-ups related to earlier years that had a decreasing impact on the income tax expense during 2021.\n\n## Net profit and return on equity\n\nNet profit increased by 69% to EUR 3,831m. Return on equity was 11.2% (last year 7.1%).\n\n## Capital position\n\nThe CET1 capital ratio was 17.0% at the end of 2021, down from 17.1% last year, while CET1 capital was EUR 25.9bn (EUR 26.6bn last year). The Group's total capital ratio was 21.2% and total own funds were EUR 32.3bn at the end of 2021.\n\nA description of the capital position is available under 'Capital management' on pages 59-65 and in the Capital and Risk Management Report at nordea.com.\n\n## Nordea's funding operations\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea Bank Abp continued to benefit from prudent liquidity risk management in terms of maintaining a diversified and strong funding base and a diversified liquidity bu/ff.ligaer. Nordea Bank Abp issued approximately EUR 13.7bn in senior long-term funding. Throughout 2021 Nordea Bank Abp remained compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement in all currencies on a combined basis. Nordea Bank Abp continues to participate in the targeted longerterm refinancing operations (TLTRO) provided by the ECB to\n\nfurther support customer needs. For more information, see the liquidity risk section in Note G2.\n\nThe Nordea Group issued approximately EUR 21.3bn in new and extended long-term funding during the year, excluding Danish covered bonds and subordinated debt. Nordea's liquidity management is presented on pages 128-163. A maturity analysis is presented in Note G44. For more information, see also Note G2.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nNordea uses hedge accounting in order to have a symmetrical accounting treatment of changes in fair value of the hedged risks in the hedged items and of the hedging instruments and in order to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows and net investments in foreign operations. More information on the hedged risks is presented in Notes G1 and G19.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\n## Development in assets\n\nTotal assets increased by EUR 18.2bn compared with 2020. The increase was largely explained by an increase in 'Cash and balances with central banks', driven by liquidity management, but there were several other gross movements. The gross movements primarily related to increases in 'Loans to the public', 'Shares' and 'Assets in pooled schemes and unitlinked investment contracts', while 'Derivatives' and 'Other assets' decreased.\n\nThe increase in 'Lending to the public' was driven by growth in customer business volumes across the Nordics, while the increase in 'Shares' was explained by positive market movements and higher shareholdings primarily in Markets and Life & Pension. The increase in 'Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts' was driven by high investment returns in Life & Pension, and the same movement can be seen on the liability side under 'Deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts'. The decrease in 'Derivatives' was driven by changes to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and the same movement can be observed in 'Derivatives' within liabilities. 'Other assets' decreased following lower levels of placed CSA collateral.\n\n## Developments in liabilities\n\nTotal liabilities increased by EUR 18.4bn compared with 2020. The increase was largely explained by an increase in 'Deposits and borrowings from the public', driven mainly by growth in customer business volumes across the Nordics. As explained under 'Development in assets' above, there was an increase in 'Deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts' and a decrease in 'Derivatives'.",

Banking\n\nTotal income increased by 9%, year on year, driven by the strong mortgage activity across all countries and higher savings and investment income. Mortgage volumes grew by 6% in local currencies.\n\nNet interest income increased by 8%, driven by the cross-Nordic mortgage volume growth, higher deposit margins in Denmark and higher mortgage margins in Finland. This development was partly o/ff.ligaset by lower mortgage margins in Norway resulting from rate changes and lower lending margins in Denmark due to a changed product mix.\n\nNet fee and commission income increased by 14%, driven by higher savings and investment income across all countries. Payment and card fee income also improved, in tandem with the reopening of societies. Our lending fee business performed strongly throughout the year, enabling us to fully compensate for the higher mortgage conversion activity in Denmark in 2020.\n\nNet result from items at fair value decreased by 24%, year on year, due to changes to income recognition principles for collar loans in Finland which took e/ff.ligaect in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 2%, year on year, mainly due to higher depreciation and amortisation and exchange rate e/ff.ligaects. These were partly o/ff.ligaset by lower sta/ff.liga costs and back-end costs.\n\nNet loan losses and similar net result decreased significantly, year on year, due to the additional management\n\njudgement allowances booked in the second quarter of 2020. As a result, operating profit increased by 41%.\n\nThe strong business momentum contributed to an improved cost-to-income ratio of 51%, down from 54% at the end of 2020.\n\n## Business Banking\n\nTotal income increased by 15%, year on year, driven by strong lending volume development and broad-based growth in net fee and commission income. Excluding the impact of Nordea Finance Equipment (NFE), which was consolidated in the results in the fourth quarter of 2020, total income increased by 10%.\n\nNet interest income increased by 14%, year on year, mainly due to higher lending volumes. Lending volumes increased by 6% in local currencies, driven by strong growth in Norway and Sweden.\n\nNet fee and commission income increased by 17%, year on year, driven by high equity and debt capital market activity, increased income from savings and investment products, higher lending fee income and higher payment and card fee income.\n\nNet result from items at fair value increased by 14%, year on year, driven by higher income from foreign exchange products.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 5%, year on year, due to the consolidation of NFE and exchange rate e/ff.ligaects. Adjusted for the impact of the NFE integration, total expenses increased by 1%.",

        "page_content": "Credit quality remained strong due to our well-diversified portfolio and limited exposure to vulnerable sectors. Net loan losses and similar net result amounted to net reversals of EUR 2m (0bp) and included a EUR 30m gain resulting from the revaluation of Nordea Kredit's mortgage portfolio.\n\nOperating profit amounted to EUR 1,434m, a year-on-year increase of 72%.\n\nROCAR increased from 9% to 16% for the full year, driven by lower loan losses and higher income.\n\n## Large Corporates & Institutions\n\nTotal income was up 12%, year on year. Net interest income increased by 6%, year on year. Lending volumes were stable due to our active business selection, focus on economic capital and repositioning of the business.\n\nNet fee and commission income was up 15%, year on year, mainly driven by high capital markets activity.\n\nNet result from items at fair value increased by 22% due to overall customer activity and a higher result from risk management, including valuation adjustments.\n\nTotal expenses increased marginally due to increased resolution fees and higher variable pay. These were partly o/ff.ligaset by continued strict cost management.\n\nNet loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 15m (3bp), reflecting the strong underlying credit quality of our loan book. The total provisioning level now stands at approximately EUR 728m or 1.56% of LC&I lending.\n\nOperating profit increased by 68%, year on year, to EUR 1,158m, mainly driven by higher income and lower loan losses.\n\nEconomic capital decreased by 3%, year on year, to EUR 5,877m, driven by strong capital discipline and a focus on more capital-light business.\n\nROCAR increased from 7% to 15%, exceeding our 2022 target of above 10%. The increase was driven by higher income, lower loan losses and lower capital.\n\n## Asset & Wealth Management\n\nTotal income amounted to EUR 1,251m, up 25%, year on year, mainly driven by higher AuM.\n\nNet interest income was EUR 77m, up 13%, year on year, mainly driven by an 18% increase in lending volumes in Private Banking.\n\nNet fee and commission income was EUR 1,045m, up 27%, year on year. The increase reflected the growth in AuM, which was driven by net flows, very strong investment performance and market development.\n\nNet result from items at fair value was EUR 125m, a yearon-year increase of 20%, due to the sale of Nordea's stake in FundConnect A/S and a higher risk result in Life & Pension.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 3%, year on year, mainly due to higher provisions for variable pay related to business performance.\n\nNet loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 0m, compared with EUR 3m in 2020.\n\nOperating profit was EUR 715m, up 49%, year on year. The cost-to-income ratio was 43%, 9 percentage points lower than in 2020.\n\nReturn on capital at risk was 31%, compared with 27% last year.\n\nA further description of each business area is available on pages 16-27 of the Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "## Other information\n\n## Group structure, subsidiaries and foreign branches\n\nThe main legal structure of the Nordea Group, including its main subsidiaries, is presented on page 51.\n\nThe parent company has foreign branches in China, Denmark, Estonia, Norway, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. During 2021 Nordea's branch in Singapore was closed.\n\n## Closing down Nordea's operations in Russia\n\nIn accordance with its strategy, Nordea is focusing on its business in the Nordic region. Consequently, the Group has decided to wind down its operations in Russia. On 24 March 2021 the Extraordinary General Meeting of JSC Nordea Bank decided to initiate the voluntary liquidation process, which was approved by the Central Bank of Russia on 16 April 2021. The voluntary liquidation process of JSC Nordea Bank is ongoing.\n\nAs required by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), Nordea has accumulated foreign exchange (FX) losses on the investment in its banking operations in Russia in equity through 'Other comprehensive income' (OCI) since the acquisition in 2007. When Nordea repatriates capital following the finalisation of the liquidation process, the IFRS require that accumulated FX losses be recycled from OCI into the income statement in the line 'Net result from items at fair value'. The final recycling amount will be dependent on FX changes up until the time the capital is repatriated, but is currently expected to be within the range of EUR 0.5-0.6bn. The impact in the income statement will be treated as an item a/ff.ligaecting comparability. There will be no impact on equity or own funds and capital, as a corresponding positive item will be recorded in OCI. In addition, Nordea does not expect this to result in any changes in its dividend or share buy-back capacity.\n\n## Nordea Direct merger\n\nOn 12 June 2019 the Boards of Directors of Nordea Direct Bank ASA (formerly Gjensidige Bank ASA) and Nordea Bank Abp signed a merger plan and resolved to initiate the crossborder merger between the two companies. The merger was formally approved by the Boards of Directors in October 2019 as announced by the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises.\n\nThe merger is ongoing, with the target completion date 1/uni00A0November 2022, subject to regulatory approval.\n\n## Referral agreement with Citi for sub-custody services\n\nOn 24 February 2021 Nordea announced that it would be exiting its Nordic sub-custody business and had entered into a strategic client referral agreement with Citi. Nordea recommends that its sub-custody clients appoint Citi as their new provider. Nordea is committed to ensuring that clients who do not migrate to Citi will be supported via an orderly transition to a service provider of their choice. The Group continues to focus on Nordic corporate, institutional and retail custody business and is committed to ensuring a well-functioning custody and settlement market in the Nordics. The agreement with Citi has no impact on Nordea's cash management services for international financial institutions.\n\n## Investments in IT\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea continued to develop its customer satisfaction with investments in digital o/ff.ligaerings for corporate customers and households with launch and enhancement of the new mobile banks and netbanks for both segments in the Nordics. Like last year there was a large focus on legal and regulatory requirements including anti-money laundering activities and KYC solutions. This work also included improving data management. As earlier, there was also focus on improving cyber security and streamlining processes.\n\nNordea will in the future continue to focus on the topics above to deliver on stakeholder requirements.\n\n## Financial crime prevention\n\nNordea takes its responsibility to society and customers seriously and has over the years built strong defences to prevent its products, services and systems from being used for unlawful purposes.\n\nNordea handles and monitors on an annual basis more than 2.8 billion payments and has more than nine million customers. In order to manage such high volumes,\n\nNordea continued to strengthen its financial crime defences in 2021 within areas such as:\n\n- i) IT support of customer due diligence processes\n- ii) continued strengthening of KYC files\n- iii) transaction monitoring capabilities\n- iv) updating of Nordea's policies in light of changes in regulations\n- v) strengthening of Nordea's sanctions programme\n\nvi) providing relevant training to ensure all our employees continue to maintain the right skill set and competencies.\n\nNordea's close cooperation with regulators continued during 2021 with ongoing engagement with all four Nordic regulators covering various aspects of Nordea's financial crime programme.\n\nSee also Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 128-163 and 'Non-financial statement' on pages 89-92.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n2021 was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nordea's Global Crisis Management Team monitored the situation in each of the Nordic countries throughout the year.\n\nInformation on the financial and operational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Nordea, as well as the measures taken to address these impacts, has been provided in various sections of this Annual Report. Nordea has also identified significant risks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic given the uncertainty of the economic impact on the markets in which the Group operates. See also 'Risks and uncertainties' on page 52.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe 2022 Annual General Meeting will be held in Helsinki on Thursday 24 March 2022.\n\nFurther information is presented on page 338 of this Annual Report.",

Nordea has defined clear risk and liquidity management frameworks including policies and instructions for di/ff.ligaerent risk types, capital adequacy and capital structure.\n\nThe Board has the overarching risk management responsibilities and decides on the Group risk strategy and the Risk Appetite Framework. Moreover, the Board oversees and monitors the implementation of the Risk Strategy, Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Management Framework, including breaches of risk appetite.\n\nThe Group CEO is responsible to the Group Board for the overall management of the Group's operations and risks.\n\nResponsibilities include ensuring that the risk strategy and risk management decided by the Board are implemented, the necessary practical measures are taken and risks are monitored and limited. The Group CEO is supported in decisionmaking by senior management within the GLT.\n\nGroup-wide committees have been established in order to promote coordination within the Group, thus ensuring commitment to and ownership of Group-wide prioritisations, decisions and implementation. The composition and areas of responsibility of each committee are established in the Group Board directives or Group CEO instructions for the respective committees.\n\nThe Internal Control Framework covers the whole Group and ensures e/ff.ligaective and e/ffi.ligacient operations, adequate identification, measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of financial and non-financial information (both internal and external) and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, supervisory requirements and Group internal rules.\n\nFor further information see Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 128-163 .\n\n## Risks and uncertainties\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces various risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 negative economic developments and conditions in the markets in which the Nordea Group operates that can adversely a/ff.ligaect Nordea's business, financial condition and results of operations or Nordea's ability to access capital and liquidity (macroeconomic risk);\n- \u00b7 risks to Nordea's balance sheet and profitability from potential adverse developments in the commercial aspects of the business (business model risk);\n- \u00b7 loss due to failure of a borrower(s) to meet their obligations (credit risk);\n- \u00b7 loss because Nordea's counterparty in an FX, interest rate, commodity, equity or credit derivative contract defaults prior to maturity of the contract (counterparty credit risk);\n- \u00b7 loss on Nordea's positions in either the trading book or the non-trading book as a result of changes in market rates and parameters that a/ff.ligaect market values or net interest income flows (market risk);\n- \u00b7 loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events, including legal risk (operational risk);\n- \u00b7 risk of misstatements or deficiencies in financial reporting and regulatory reporting and disclosures (financial reporting risk);\n- \u00b7 risks associated with Nordea's ability to service its cash flow obligations related to lending, investment, funding, o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures and other activities which result in a negative cash flow mismatch, when they fall due, or its ability to meet its cash flow obligations without incurring significant additional funding costs (liquidity risk);\n- \u00b7 adverse e/ff.ligaects on capital adequacy, financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making and damage to Nordea's reputation from the use of models (model risk);\n- \u00b7 unexpected losses due to changes in the level, trend or volatility of mortality rates, longevity rates, disability rates and non-life claim rates (insurance risk);\n- \u00b7 failure to comply with applicable regulations and related internal rules, potentially resulting in criticism against Nordea, reputation loss, fines, sanctions, disputes and/or litigation (compliance risk);\n- \u00b7 claims in civil lawsuits and disputes (claims and disputes risk);\n- \u00b7 environmental, social and governance risks (ESG risks);\n- \u00b7 cyber threats, attacks and fraud, misuse of existing and new technology against Nordea or violations or failures regarding information security in relation to Nordea's data or IT environment (cyber security risk).\n\nFor further information see 'Non-financial statement' on pages 89-92, 'Sustainability notes' on pages 315-337, Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 128-163, Note G33 'Provisions' on page 195 and Note G38 'Contingent liabilities' on page 201.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThere are significant risks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic given the uncertainty of the economic impact on the markets in which Nordea operates. Depending on future developments, potential adverse impacts on income could arise due to lower net interest income, market volatility and reduced business activity impacting transaction volumes and customer activity.\n\nDepending on the duration and magnitude of the situation, there is a possibility that Nordea will not be able to meet its financial targets in very adverse scenarios.",

        "page_content": "## Macroeconomy and financial markets\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nThe world economy recovered swiftly from the pandemic during the first half of 2021 supported by a lenient economic policy and the roll-out of e/ff.ligaective vaccination programmes especially in the advanced economies. The global recovery, however, lost steam in the second half of the year as supply shortages became more outspoken. Supply has been restrained by outbreaks of new COVID variants and bottleneck problems in various parts of the global value chains. Still global economic activity is estimated to have grown by 5.5% in 2021 compared with 2020 and world GDP now exceeds the pre-COVID-19 level.\n\nGlobal demand remains strong and growth is expected to resume as the logistic issues are being resolved supported by an expansionary fiscal policy with focus on investments in the green and digital transformation of societies.\n\nHowever, sharply increasing energy prices as well as high commodity prices and transportation costs have resulted in a significant global inflationary pressure. The development has led to increased vigilance at central banks around the world and monetary policy has already been tightened in many countries. This tendency will continue in 2022.\n\nThe Nordic countries have been among the best performing countries globally during the pandemic and GDP levels are now higher than before the pandemic in all four countries. The upswing is expected to continue in 2022.\n\n## Denmark\n\nDanish GDP rebounded strongly in 2021 with an increase of 3.8% according to the preliminary figures. During the second quarter of 2021 the level of GDP surpassed the peak from the fourth quarter of 2019.  Both household consumption and exports of goods made large positive contributions to the increase in GDP in 2021. High demand for labour has pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level since prior to the financial crisis. At the same time the number of vacancies has risen to a record high. Since mid-2021 real estate prices have only increased marginally and turnover has been falling back to the levels prior to the crisis. In 2021 the DKK traded on the strong side of the central parity against the EUR. Danmarks Nationalbank intervened significantly in the FX market throughout the year and sanctioned an independent interest rate cut in September to maintain the fixed exchange rate policy.\n\n## Finland\n\nThe Finnish economy recovered swiftly in 2021 from the economic downturn initiated by the coronavirus in 2020. For the full year of 2021, Finnish GDP increased by approximately 3.8% reaching the 2019 level already in the second quarter of\n\n2021. The situation in the service sector is much better than a year ago, though still not normal. The export sector has benefited from recovering global demand, but the global shortage of materials and components is starting to take a toll. The unemployment rate was 7% in December. The Finnish housing market continued its good performance in 2021. However, demand and prices normalised during the second half of the year. Apartment prices were 3.1% higher in the fourth quarter compared with the year before. Inflation accelerated during 2021, mostly due to higher energy prices. Inflation was 3.5% in December. The ECB's monetary policy rates are not expected to be changed until 2023 at the earliest.\n\n## Norway\n\nThe Norwegian economy rebounded strongly in 2021 after the stringent restrictions were eased. Mainland GDP was 3.1% higher in November 2021 compared with the level before the pandemic. Registered unemployment fell to 2.3% (seasonally adjusted) at the end of December 2021, close to the level before the pandemic. The outbreak of the Omicron variant in Norway has led to some restrictions that have curbed growth; however, the restrictions should not materially impact the economy. Now that the economy has normalised, Norges Bank is increasing interest rates. The central bank increased the key rate from 0.25% to 0.5% in December and signalled that it would most likely raise the rate to 0.75% in March 2022. The latest prognosis from the central bank is for the key rate to climb to 1.25% at the end of 2022. After a strong start to the year, house prices developed moderately and rose 5.2%, year on year, in December 2021. The Norwegian krone has moved in tandem with oil prices and is close to the levels at the beginning of 2021.\n\n## Sweden\n\nThe Swedish economy showed good growth in 2021. Growth in domestic demand was robust and broad based. External demand remained high while growth in the export industry was hampered by shortage of input goods. The situation on the labour market improved swiftly. The unemployment rate averaged 7.9% for 2021 but ended the year lower and somewhat above 7%. Home prices increased by 10% in the course of 2021. Sveriges Riksbank kept its repo rate unchanged at 0% in November 2021 and signalled that the repo rate would remain unchanged until the second half of 2024. The quantitative easing programme ended in December 2021. The Riksbank indicated that the balance sheet would be kept unchanged during 2022, but that it would be reduced in 2023. The trade-weighted Swedish krona weakened by 3.5% in 2021.",

Ranked by market capitalisation, Nordea was the 11th largest company in the Nordic region and among the ten largest European financial groups.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq Nordic, the stock exchanges in Helsinki (in euro), Stockholm (in Swedish krona) and Copenhagen (in Danish krone) and its American Depository Receipts (ADR) are traded in the US in US dollars.\n\n## Share price performance\n\nIn 2021 the Nordea share price appreciated by approximately 62% on the Nasdaq Helsinki exchange from EUR 6.67 to EUR 10.79. The daily closing prices listed for the Nordea share in 2021 ranged between EUR 6.60 and EUR 11.24. In 2021 the Nasdaq OMXH index appreciated by approximately 18% and the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index appreciated by approximately 34%. Since 6 March 2000, the date of the merger between MeritaNordbanken and Unidanmark, the Nordea share has appreciated by 166%, clearly outperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index (-57%) and the Nasdaq OMXH index (-30%).\n\nNordea's share price can be monitored on nordea.com, where it is also possible to compare the performance of the Nordea share with competitors and general indices as well as find historical prices for the Nordea share.\n\n## Total shareholder return 2021\n\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) is the market value growth per share and reinvested dividends. Total shareholder return in 2021 was 74.5% (-7.8% in 2020). During 2021 Nordea paid out dividends of EUR 0.79 per share and bought back 109 million shares. Nordea's total decided shareholder capital distributions amounted to around EUR 4.9bn in 2021.\n\n## Turnover - the most liquid Nordic bank share\n\nThe Nordea share was the most liquid Nordic bank share in 2021, with an average daily trading volume of approximately EUR 148m, corresponding to approximately 16 million shares.\n\n## Nordea share price performance compared with European banks, 2000-2021, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSOURCE: Macrobond and Nordea.\n\nTurnover on all exchanges combined totalled EUR 37.3bn in 2021, corresponding to 4 billion shares.\n\n72% of the total volume traded in Nordea shares in 2021 took place over Nasdaq, of which approximately 44% was SEK-denominated, 26% EUR-denominated and 3% DKKdenominated. The remaining 28% of the traded volume took place over other exchanges such as Cboe European Equities, Turquoise and Aquis.\n\n## Share and voting rights\n\nNordea's Articles of Association do not contain any provisions on share classes or voting rights and consequently Nordea has one class of shares and all shares in Nordea are ordinary shares. Each share confers one vote at Nordea's general meetings as well as an equal right to any dividend. On 31 December 2021 the total number of shares in Nordea was 3,965,561,160. See also 'Statement of changes in equity' on pages 100-103.\n\nThere are no restrictions in the Articles of Association regarding the right to transfer shares and Nordea is not aware of any agreements between shareholders in this respect. However, as Nordea is a credit institution, a direct or indirect acquisition of shares in Nordea, which results in the acquirer's total holdings being considered qualified holdings (representing 10% or more of the equity capital or of the voting rights, or a holding that otherwise enables the acquirer to exercise a substantial influence over the management of Nordea) or an increase in qualified holdings, may only occur following approval by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority according to the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions. Under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the European Central Bank is the authority that ultimately decides (in cooperation with the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority) whether to approve an acquisition of a qualifying holding in Nordea as Nordea is subject to the direct supervision of the European Central Bank.\n\nOn 31 December 2021, Sampo plc was the largest individual shareholder with a holding of 6.1%.

The ECB in general expected dividends and share buy-backs to remain below 15% of the cumulated profit for 2019-2020 and not to exceed 20bp of the CET1 ratio until the end of September 2021. The Board of Directors of Nordea decided on 16/uni00A0December 2020 to follow the updated ECB recommendation.\n\nBased on the recommendation and after a dialogue with the ECB, the Board of Directors decided on 18 February 2021 on a dividend distribution of EUR 0.07 per share in accordance with the mandate received from the 2020 Annual Gen-\n\n## Turnover of the Nordea share on stock exchanges, 2000-2021 1 , EURbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1)  Nasdaq Exchanges from 2001.

The record date for the dividend payment was 22 February 2021 and the payment date was 1 March 2021 or as soon as possible thereafter.\n\nOn 23 July 2021 the ECB communicated that the recommendation to banks to limit dividends would expire on 30/uni00A0September 2021. Given this the Board of Directors decided on 1 October 2021 on the distribution of an ordinary dividend per share of EUR 0.72 (EUR 0.33 for 2019 and EUR 0.39 for 2020) in accordance with the mandate received from the 2021/uni00A0AGM. The record date for the dividend payment was 5/uni00A0October 2021 and the payment date 12 October 2021 or as soon as possible thereafter.\n\n## Share buy-backs\n\nNordea received approval from the ECB on 16 September 2021 to repurchase up to EUR 2.0bn of its own shares. Following the approval, the Board of Directors of Nordea decided on 20/uni00A0October to launch a share buy-back programme of up to EUR 2.0bn commencing on 22 October 2021 and ending no later than 30 April 2022. The purpose of the share buy-back programme is to pursue an e/ffi.ligacient capital structure and generate sustainable shareholder return to the benefit of all shareholders by reducing the capital of Nordea. The programme is carried out in accordance with the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by the 2021 AGM. For the purpose of executing the buy-back programme, Nordea has engaged a third-party broker that based on irrevocable instructions will decide on the repurchase of shares in full independence, also in relation to the timing of the transactions, and in compliance with applicable price and volume limits as well as the terms of the programme. The shares are acquired otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the company's shareholders (directed repurchases) in public trading or outside public trading and not more than 500,000,000 shares may be repurchased subject to the maximum amount of up to EUR 2.0bn.

        "page_content": "## Capital management and new regulations\n\nNordea strives to be e/ffi.ligacient in its use of capital and therefore actively manages its balance sheet with respect to di/ff.ligaerent asset, liability and risk categories. The goal is to enhance returns to shareholders while maintaining a prudent capital structure. The Board of Directors decides ultimately on the targets for capital ratios, the capital and dividend policies and the overall framework of capital management at Nordea. The ability to meet targets to maintain minimum capital requirements is reviewed regularly within the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee.\n\n## Capital and dividend policy\n\nThe capital policy states that the Nordea Group under normal business conditions should have minimum targets for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the total capital ratio that exceed the capital requirements set by the competent authorities. In addition, Nordea will maintain a management bu/ff.ligaer. Our intention is to hold a CET1 capital management bu/ff.ligaer of 150-200bp above the CET1 capital ratio requirement (restriction level for the maximum distributable amount, MDA). We strive to maintain a strong capital position in line with our capital policy.\n\nOur ambition is to distribute 60-70% of the net profit for the year to shareholders. Excess capital in relation to capital targets will be used for organic growth and strategic business acquisitions, as well as be subject to buy-back considerations.\n\nOn 16 September 2021 Nordea received permission from the ECB for share buy-backs of up to EUR 2bn. The full amount is deducted from CET1 capital from the date of the permission. On 20 October the Board of Directors decided to launch the buyback programme which started on 22 October 2021 and is intended to end no later than 30 April 2022. As at the end of December 2021, purchases of 108.9 million shares, which correspond to an amount of EUR 1,163m, have reduced retained earnings. On 31 December 84,390,759 shares had been cancelled, which means that the total number of shares in Nordea was 3,965,561,160 at the end of 2021. For share cancellations after the end of the period, see the section 'Events after the financial period' on page 93.\n\n## Minimum capital requirements\n\nThe calculation method for the risk exposure amount (REA) depends on regulatory approval. Nordea had 86% of its credit risk exposure amount covered by the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach by the end of 2021. Nordea is approved to use its own internal value-at-risk (VaR) models to calculate capital requirements for the major share of the market risk in its trading book. For operational risk the standardised approach is applied. Based on the total REA, Nordea needs to hold the applicable minimum and combined bu/ff.ligaer requirements. In addition, competent authorities require Nordea to hold capital for other risks which are identified and communicated as part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process.\n\nNordea received the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process decision on 2 February 2022, which includes the decision to maintain the current Pillar 2 requirement of 1.75% (of which 0.98% is to be met with CET1 capital).\n\n## Internal capital requirement\n\nFor internal risk and capital assessment purposes, Nordea uses the internal capital requirement (ICR) in line with Article 73 of the CRD. The ICR specifies the amount, type and distribution of internal capital that is considered adequate to cover the nature and level of all risks to which the Group or any of its subsidiaries are or might become exposed over a foreseeable future, including during periods of stress.\n\nThe ICR is one of the main inputs for the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), together with regulatory views on the required amount of capital as expressed under the regulatory perspective.\n\nNordea defines the ICR as the internal capital requirement for all material risks from an internal economic perspective, taking account of the regulatory, normative, through-thecycle perspective, adequate to withstand periods of stress. This ensures that Nordea's ICR is aligned with, but not restricted by, the regulatory perspective.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nEconomic capital (EC) is a method for allocating the cost of holding capital as a result of risk taking and is a central component in the Value Creation Framework (VCF). The VCF supports the operational decision-making process at Nordea to enhance performance management and ensure shareholder value creation. The EC is aligned with the Group's target CET1 ratio, which is set to ensure sustainable long-term capitalisation for the Nordea Group. In addition, the EC framework also includes the following items:\n\n- (a) legal equity contribution of NLP\n- (b)  certain capital deductions for which allocation keys have been agreed.\n\nThe EC (including Nordea Life & Pension) was EUR 23.2bn at the end of 2021 (EUR 23.5bn at the end of 2020). The EC remained broadly stable across the year.\n\n## Own funds\n\nOwn funds are the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of both Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and Additional Tier 1 capital. CET1 capital is considered to be capital of the highest quality with ultimate loss-absorbance characteristics and consists predominately of paid-in capital and retained earnings. Profit may only be included after permission from the ECB and after deducting the proposed dividend. Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital consist mostly of undated and dated subordinated loans, respectively. Holdings of other financial sector entities' subordinated loans are deducted from the corresponding tier.",

        "page_content": "## New regulations on capital requirements\n\nIn June 2019 the 'banking package' containing revisions to the BRRD, the CRD and the CRR was adopted. The package includes a review of the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), a review of the market risk requirements (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, FRTB), the introduction of a binding net stable funding ratio (NSFR), the introduction of a strict leverage ratio requirement of 3% to be met by Tier 1 capital and amendments to the Pillar 2 and macroprudential framework. The revised CRD (CRD V) and BRRD (BRRD II) apply from 28 December 2020 and entered into force in Finnish law from 1 April 2021, while the majority of the changes in the CRR (CRR II) applies from 28 June 2021. In Norway the implementation of the 'banking package' is still pending but expected during the first half of 2022.\n\nIn May Nordea received the Single Resolution Board's decision on the Nordea Group's minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MRELs). According to the decision, Nordea's MREL requirements are 22.71% of the risk exposure amount (REA) and 5.98% of the leverage ratio exposure (LRE). Nordea's MREL subordination requirements are 16.06% of REA and 5.98% of LRE. The own funds used by Nordea to comply with its combined bu/ff.ligaer requirement (CBR) are not eligible to meet the MREL and MREL subordination requirements expressed as a percentage of the REA. As a result, the MREL and MREL subordination requirements including the fourth-quarter CBR of 4.73% of REA are 27.44% and 20.79% of REA, respectively. Both the MREL and MREL subordination requirements will be binding from 1 January 2022, with no transitional period. These requirements will be assessed and updated annually by the Single Resolution Board.\n\nOn 18 June the European Central Bank announced that banks could continue to exclude certain central bank exposures from the leverage ratio, given the continued exceptional macroeconomic circumstances due to COVID-19. The exemp-\n\ntion is valid until March 2022. Nordea has decided not to take advantage of this extension.\n\nOn 28 June the Finnish FSA decided to maintain the other systemically important institutions (O-SII) capital bu/ff.ligaer for Finnish banks identified as systemically important. For Nordea, this means that the current O-SII bu/ff.ligaer of 2% will be maintained.\n\nDuring 2020 the ECB made recommendations to refrain from or limit dividends due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which continued into 2021. In July 2021 the ECB decided not to extend the recommendation, and the recommendation expired on 30 September 2021.\n\nIn March 2020 the countercyclical bu/ff.ligaer rate was decreased in Sweden, Denmark and Norway due to COVID19. During 2021 decisions were made to increase the bu/ff.ligaer rates. In Norway it was first decided to increase the bu/ff.ligaer rate from the current 1.0% to 1.5% from June 2022 and then in December it was also decided to further increase the bu/ff.ligaer from 1.5% to 2.0% from 31 December 2022. In Denmark it was first decided to increase the bu/ff.ligaer rate from 0% to 1.0% from September 2022 and then in December it was also decided to increase the bu/ff.ligaer from 1.0% to 2.0% from 31 December 2022. In Sweden it was decided to increase the bu/ff.ligaer rate from the current 0% to 1.0% from September 2022. In Finland the buffer rate remains at 0%.\n\nTo mitigate the e/ff.ligaect of the Norwegian implementation of the CRR and CRD IV, changes to the systemic risk bu/ff.ligaer (SRB) were implemented from 31 December 2020. The previous SRB of 3% for all Norwegian banks was changed to an SRB of 4.5% for all Norwegian exposures. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance requested the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) to issue a recommendation to other EEA states to reciprocate the measures. On 26 May the ESRB recommended reciprocation within 18 months but also recognised the regulatory differences between Norway and the EU, and reciprocation should therefore take into account any overlaps or di/ff.ligaerences",

        "page_content": "in regulations. On 19 August the Finnish FSA stated that the decision on the application of the Norwegian SRB will be taken at a later stage and enter into force 12 months after the decision is taken. If reciprocity is accepted by the Finnish FSA, the measures would then also apply to the Nordea Group, leading to an estimated increase in the Group's CET1 capital ratio requirement of up to approximately 95bp.\n\nIn Norway risk weight floors for residential real estate of 20% and for commercial real estate of 35% according to Article 458 of the CRR apply from 31 December 2020. On 19 August the Finnish FSA decided to reciprocate the floors from 11 September 2021.\n\nThe Swedish FSA has also implemented a risk weight floor for residential mortgages of 25%. The floor was implemented with e/ff.ligaect from 31 December 2018, and in December 2020 it was prolonged to also be valid during 2021. In December 2021 it was again decided to prolong it, this time until 30 December 2023. The floor has been reciprocated by the Finnish FSA and is therefore valid for the Nordea Group.\n\n## Finalisation of Basel III framework ('Basel IV')\n\nBasel III is a global regulatory framework for bank capital adequacy, stress testing and liquidity risk. In December 2017 the finalised Basel III framework, often called the Basel IV package, was published. The Basel IV package was supposed to be implemented in 2022, but was postponed until 2023 due to COVID-19. It includes revisions to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and the leverage ratio and introduces a new output floor.\n\nBefore being applicable to Nordea, the Basel IV package needs to be implemented into EU regulations. On 27 October the proposal for the implementation into EU regulations was published by the European Commission by amendments to the CRD and CRR. The proposal from the Commission is to set the start date to 1 January 2025. The proposal is now subject to negotiations between the Commission, the Council and the Parliament before the final set of regulations is decided.\n\nFor credit risk, the proposal includes revisions to both the IRB approach, where restrictions on the use of the IRB for certain exposures are implemented, and the standardised approach. Also, for market risk the internal model approach and the standardised approach have been revised. For operational risk, the three existing approaches will be removed and replaced by one standardised approach to be used by all banks. For CVA risk, the internally modelled approach is removed and the standardised approach is revised.\n\nThe output floor is to be set at 72.5% of the standardised approaches on an aggregate level, meaning that the capital requirement under the floor will be 72.5% of the total Pillar 1 REA calculated with the standardised approaches for credit, market and operational risk. The floor will be phased in, starting with 50% from 1 January 2025 to be fully implemented at 72.5% from 1 January 2030 and with transitional rules for the calculation of the REA for the output floor extending to end-2032.",

All the recommendations of the Code are complied with, apart from the appointment procedure for electing employee representatives to the Board (the Code, Recommendation 5), as described further below.\n\nThis Corporate Governance Statement describes Nordea's approach to the key elements of corporate governance and is prepared in accordance with the legal requirements of the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Securities Market Act, the Decree of the Ministry of Finance on the obligation of securities issuers to disclose periodic information and the Code 1 .\n\nNordea's Corporate Governance Statement is available at nordea.com and the Code is available at https://cgfin- land.fi/en.\n\n## Corporate governance at Nordea\n\nNordea is a Finnish public limited liability company and the parent company of the Nordea Group (comprising the Company and its subsidiaries). The Company's shares are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchanges in Helsinki, Stockholm and Copenhagen and its American Depository Receipts (ADR) are traded in the US in US dollars. Furthermore, as part of its funding operations the Company issues long-term debt instruments that are usually listed on various stock exchanges. The corporate governance of Nordea is proportionate and comprehensive with\n\nrespect to the nature, scope and diversity of the Company's operations to ensure e/ff.ligaective management in accordance with the prudent conduct of business principles. Furthermore, Nordea's commitment to its purpose, values and vision requires the integration of sound corporate governance practices into regular business activities.\n\nThe Board of Directors (the Board) and the President and Group CEO are responsible for the management of the Company. The main emphasis is on the Board noting and undertaking its role in Nordea's corporate governance structure and the interaction with the other governing bodies to ensure sound corporate governance, including systems for internal control and risk management regarding financial reporting.\n\nCorporate governance and the duties of the governing bodies of Nordea are defined by the applicable internal and external frameworks. The external framework that regulates corporate governance includes EU law and national level laws, such as Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD IV), Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (MiFIR), as well as rules and guidelines issued by the relevant financial supervisory authorities, such as the EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance (GL11) and the Joint ESMA and EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders (GL12), as well as national level laws, including the Finnish Companies Act, the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Finnish Accounting Act and the relevant FIN-FSA regulations and guidelines. Nordea also complies with rules and guidelines issued by other relevant financial supervisory authorities as well as EU legislation for the financial industry, stock exchange rules for each relevant stock exchange and the rules and principles of the Code.\n\n- 1)   Nordea complies with the Code of its domicile as well as other applicable governance rules and regulations, and this Corporate Governance Statement is prepared in accordance with these requirements. The Code deviates in certain aspects from the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the Swedish Code) and the Danish Recommendations on Corporate Governance (the Danish Code) due to di/ff.ligaerences in legislation and corporate governance rules and practices. The Swedish Code, available at corporategovernanceboard.se, deviates in certain aspects from the Code in terms of decision proposals of the nomination committee, process for decisions on remuneration for the executive management and content of the Remuneration Report. The Danish Code, available at corporategovernance.dk, deviates in certain aspects from the Code in terms of appointment of an audit committee chair, management remuneration and performance evaluation of the board of directors as well as recommendations regarding takeover bids, corporate social responsibility, tax policy and the charter of the board of directors. The Danish Code also deviates in certain aspects regarding the overall tasks and responsibilities of the board of directors, the annual review of guidelines, the appointment of a vice chair and the independence of directors as well as the temporary division of duties and whistleblower schemes.\n\n## Corporate governance structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## External framework\n\nLegislation, regulation, best practice, stock exchange rules, corporate governance code\n\n## Internal framework\n\nArticles of Association, the Group Board and Group Board Committee Charters, Group Board directives, Group CEO instructions, internal rules, Nordea's Code of Conduct and values",

        "page_content": "The Board has adopted instructions for the President and Group CEO specifying his responsibilities as well as other charters, policies and instructions for the operations of the Nordea Group. Furthermore, Nordea's Code of Conduct provides an ethical framework for the conduct of all members of governing bodies and employees. These mechanisms, together with the Articles of Association, the Charter (as defined below) and the Committee Charters (as defined below), constitute the internal framework that regulates corporate governance at Nordea. The internal framework is designed to enable the prudent conduct of business by defining the powers and responsibilities of the corporate bodies and employees.\n\n## ECB supervision and governance\n\nNordea is supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Single Supervisory Mechanism/SSM), and the branches and subsidiaries are supervised by the financial supervisory authorities in their respective countries, as applicable. Under ECB supervision Nordea is subject to the same banking supervision and single resolution mechanisms as the majority of other European banks. The authority interaction function at Nordea is placed in Group Legal that acts as one point of contact and the coordinator for supervisory requests and interactions, to enable coordinated and consistent communication between Nordea and its supervisors. Nordea uses standardised practices to process supervisory requests and on-site inspections, including a case management system where all interactions are documented. The Group Leadership Team (GLT) and the relevant committees receive authority interaction reports on a regular basis. The Board is informed about the key authority interactions, including SREP decision and on-site inspection reports. Furthermore, the Board oversees key supervisory remediation programmes and approves the remediation action plans required by the ECB.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) governance\n\nThe Board has a leading role in driving the sustainability strategy and is assisted by its committees. At management level, ESG is organisationally integrated into the existing processes for decision-making, risk management and control as well as escalation, including management committee structures. The first line of defence is responsible for managing sustainability and financial impacts, while the second line of defence is accountable for developing the ESG-related risk management framework.\n\nIn 2021 Nordea appointed the Chief of Sta/ff.liga to coordinate and facilitate the Group-wide integration of ESG factors into the Risk Management Framework and business processes. Consequently, a new ESG implementation programme was launched under a newly established operational steering committee. The programme, which integrates first and second line of defence e/ff.ligaorts, aims to ensure an e/ffi.ligacient and consistent implementation of both the sustainability targets and objectives as well as the ESG-related risk management frameworks across key areas, including credit processes, risk scoring of customers, reporting and regulatory compliance.\n\nFor more information on ESG governance at Nordea, see 'Non-financial statement' on pages 89-92 and 'Sustainability notes' on pages 315-337.\n\n## Division of powers and responsibilities\n\nThe management and control of Nordea is divided among the shareholders (at general meetings), the Board and the President and Group CEO, pursuant to the provisions of the external framework, the Articles of Association and the internal framework set forth by the Board.\n\n## General meetings of shareholders (1)\n\nThe general meeting is the Company's highest decision-making body, at which shareholders participate in the supervision and control of the Company through their voting rights and right to speak. Applicable regulations and the Articles of Association of the Company determine the matters to be dealt with at a general meeting. At the general meeting, decisions are taken regarding matters such as the financial statements, dividend, election of Board members and auditor as well as remuneration for Board members and the auditor. In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies and the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies are presented and adopted through an advisory vote at the general meeting. The Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies and the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies are available at nordea.com.\n\n## General meetings are held in Helsinki\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and in order to ensure the health and safety of the Company's shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, the Board resolved on extraordinary meeting procedures for the 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM) pursuant to the temporary legislation initially adopted by the Finnish parliament on 24 April 2020 (the Temporary Legislation). The AGM was held on 24 March 2021 at the head o/ffi.ligace of the Company without physical participation, and shareholders and their proxy representatives could thus only participate in the AGM and exercise their shareholders' rights by voting in advance and by making counterproposals and asking questions in advance.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the members of the Board, the proposed new Board member, the President and Group CEO, the Company's auditor and representatives of the Company's senior management were not physically present at the 2021 AGM. Information on the decisions of the 2021 AGM and the minutes are available at nordea.com.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, also the 2022 AGM will be arranged at the head o/ffi.ligace of the Company on Thursday 24 March 2022 in accordance with the extraordinary meeting procedures pursuant to the Temporary Legislation.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nNordea's Articles of Association do not contain any provisions on share classes or voting rights. Consequently, all issued shares are ordinary shares and carry equal voting rights, with each share carrying one vote at general meetings. At general meetings, each shareholder is entitled to vote according to the full number of shares they hold or represent. Nordea is not entitled to vote on its own shares at general meetings under applicable legislation. More information about the Nordea share is presented in 'The Nordea share and ratings' on page 54 and in 'Financial review 2021' on pages 44-45.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe Articles of Association are available at nordea.com. Amendments to the Articles of Association are determined by the AGM pursuant to Finnish law and are subject to the review of the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.\n\n## Shareholders' Nomination Board (2)\n\nPursuant to the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, a significant credit institution must have a nomination committee that consists of board members or a shareholders' nomination board that consists of members appointed by the shareholders. The AGM held on 28 March 2019 decided to establish a permanent Shareholders' Nomination Board. According to the Charter of the Shareholders' Nomination Board, the Shareholders' Nomination Board is to prepare, annually and otherwise when",

The Shareholders' Nomination Board must also participate in the evaluation and succession planning of the Board and in its work consider the Diversity Policy of Nordea as well as perform certain other tasks assigned in its Charter.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board comprises the Chair of the Board (Torbj\u00f6rn Magnusson) and four members appointed on 31 August 2021 by the four largest shareholders in terms of voting rights, who wish to participate on the Shareholders' Nomination Board. Holders of nominee registered shares are taken into account when appointing the members.\n\nThe composition of the Shareholders' Nomination Board was made public on 15 September 2021. Sampo plc had appointed Ricard Wennerklint, Nordea-fonden had appointed Lars Ingemann Nielsen, Alecta had appointed Ann Grevelius and Cevian Capital had appointed Niko Pakal\u00e9n as members of the Shareholders' Nomination Board. Ricard Wennerklint had been appointed Chairman of the Shareholders' Nomination Board. On 31 August 2021 the appointed members of the Shareholders' Nomination Board represented approximately 23% of all shares in the Company.\n\nPrior to the 2022 AGM, the Shareholders' Nomination Board, constituted in the autumn of 2021, held 8 meetings. Each member participated in all the meetings and decisionmaking of the Shareholders' Nomination Board apart from Torbj\u00f6rn Magnusson who did not participate in the preparation or decision-making where he had a conflict of interest.\n\n## Ricard Wennerklint, Chairman of the Shareholders' Nomination Board\n\nStockholm School of Economics (Business Administration and Finance and Executive Education, Advanced Management\n\nProgramme)\n\nBorn 1969\n\nGroup Executive Vice President, Sampo plc\n\n## Lars Ingemann Nielsen\n\nMaster of Science (Mathematical Finance and Economics) Born 1961\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, Nordea-fonden\n\n## Ann Grevelius\n\nBachelor of Science (Finance and Management) Born 1966 Non-Executive Director, Alecta\n\n## Niko Pakal\u00e9n\n\nMaster of Science (Economics) Born 1986 Partner, Cevian Capital\n\n## Torbj\u00f6rn Magnusson\n\nMaster of Science and Licentiate of Engineering Born 1963\n\nChair of the Board of Directors of Nordea Bank Abp\n\nSee 'Board of Directors' on pages 70-71 for more information.\n\nThe proposals of the Shareholders' Nomination Board are presented in the notice of the 2022 AGM and are also available at nordea.com.\n\n## Board of Directors (3)\n\nThe Board of the Company is charged with the organisation of Nordea and the administration of the Company's operations and the overall management of the Nordea Group's a/ff.ligaairs in accordance with the external and internal frameworks.\n\n## Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nAccording to the Articles of Association, the Board must consist of not less than 6 and not more than 15 members. The term of o/ffi.ligace for Board members is one year and expires at the end of the AGM following the election. Nordea has neither a specific retirement age for Board members nor a time limit for how long a Board member may serve on the Board. According to the Code, if a Board member has served as a member for more than ten consecutive years, this must be taken into consideration when conducting the overall evaluation of independence. Furthermore, applicable European regulatory requirements of the banking sector are taken into account in the evaluation.\n\nThe Company strives to promote diversity of the members of the Board with the aim to ensure that the Board, as a whole and for the purpose of its work, possesses requisite knowledge of and experience in the social, business and cultural conditions of the regions and markets in which the main activities of the Nordea Group are carried out.\n\nThe Board has adopted a diversity policy that establishes the principles of diversity of the Board. According to the Diversity Policy, all Board member nominations must be based on merit with the prime consideration being to maintain and enhance the Board's overall e/ff.ligaectiveness. Within this, a broad set of qualities and competencies is sought for and it is recognised that diversity, including age, gender, geographical provenance and educational and professional background, is an important factor to take into consideration. Nordea's objective is to have a fair, equal and balanced representation of gender and other diversifying factors on the Board collectively. With regards to gender balance, the Board's composition is aimed to be aligned with the Nordea Group's ambition of no gender being represented by less than 40%. The Board is to have a composition appropriate to the Company's operations and phase of development and the Board members elected by the AGM are collectively to exhibit diversity and breadth of opinions, qualifications and experience.\n\nDuring the nomination work prior to the 2022 AGM, the Chair of the Board of the Company informed the Shareholders' Nomination Board of the competencies and skills needed for the Board as a whole and for Board members individually and, as has been customary, the Nomination Board also met with the President and CEO, Frank Vang-Jensen. The Shareholders' Nomination Board considered a broad range of qualifications and knowledge to ensure su/ffi.ligacient expertise and independence and also strived for equal gender distribution in accordance with the Sustainability Policy and the Diversity Policy of the Company.\n\nIt is assessed that the Board collectively possesses the requisite knowledge of and experience in the social, business",

Of these Board members, 10 (6 men and 4 women) were elected by the AGM held on 24 March 2021, and 3 ordinary members and 1 deputy member (2 men and 2 women) were appointed by the employees of the Nordea Group. The Board members elected by the 2021 AGM are Torbj\u00f6rn Magnusson (Chair), Kari Jordan (Vice Chair), Claudia Dill, Nigel Hinshelwood, Petra van Hoeken, Robin Lawther, John Maltby, Sarah Russell, Birger Steen and Jonas Synnergren. Additionally, Pernille Erenbjerg was a member of the Board until the end of the 2021 AGM.\n\nAs mentioned above, in addition to the members proposed by the Shareholders' Nomination Board and elected by the AGM, 3 ordinary members and 1 deputy member are appointed by the employees of the Nordea Group as employee repre-\n\nsentatives to the Board. The employee representatives until the end of the 2021 AGM are Joanna Koskinen (replaced Kari Ahola in August 2021), Dorrit Groth Brandt (deputy member), Gerhard Olsson and Hans Christian Riise. The appointment procedure for the employee representatives to the Board deviates from Recommendation 5 'Election of the Board of Directors' of the Code. The reason for this deviation is an agreement on employee representation entered by Nordea and an employee representation body under the Finnish Act on Employee Involvement in European Companies and European Social Cooperatives as well as the Finnish Act on Personnel Representation in the Company Administration in connection with the cross-border merger e/ff.ligaectuating the redomiciliation to Finland in 2018.\n\nThe President and Group CEO of Nordea is not a member of the Board. The composition of the Board is set out on pages 68-69, and further information regarding the Board members elected by the AGM and the employee representatives is presented in the sections 'Board of Directors' and 'Employee representatives' on pages 70-71.",

        "page_content": "## Independence of the Board of Directors\n\nNordea complies with applicable requirements regarding the independence of the Board according to applicable European regulatory requirements and Finnish laws and regulations as well as requirements according to the Code. Under the Code, the majority of the board members must be independent of the company, and at least two board members who are independent of the company must also be independent of the significant shareholders of the company. The Board meets this requirement.\n\nThe Board considers all the members elected by the shareholders at the 2021 AGM to be independent of the Company according to the Code, including Sarah Russell who has been a Board member of the Company and its legal predecessors for over 11 consecutive years. Based on an overall evaluation, her independence is not compromised because of her long service history, and no other factors or circumstances have been identified that could impair her independence. No Board member elected by the shareholders at the 2021 AGM is employed by or works in an operative capacity at the Company. The ordinary Board members and the deputy Board member appointed by the employees are employed by the Nordea Group and are therefore not independent of the Company according to the Code.\n\nAll Board members are furthermore considered independent of the Company's significant shareholders according to the Code. Sampo plc ceased to be a significant shareholder of the Company according to the Code as of October 2021, and thus Torbj\u00f6rn Magnusson, as the Managing Director of Sampo plc and Group CEO and President of the Sampo Group, is considered independent of the Company's significant shareholders.\n\nThe independence of each Board member is also shown in the table on page 74.\n\n## Work of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board elects the Vice Chair and appoints the members of the Board committees. The Board has adopted written working procedures governing its work, which also describe the management and risk reporting to the Board (the Charter), and separate working procedures for its work carried out in each of the Board committees (the Committee Charters). For example, the Charter determines the Board's and the Chair's respective areas of responsibility, documentation and quorum as well as the frequency of meetings. It also contains rules regarding conflicts of interest, confidentiality and the Board Secretary (currently Jussi Koskinen, Chief Legal O/ffi.ligacer).\n\nThe Board is charged with the organisation of Nordea, the administration of the Company's operations and the overall management of the Nordea Group's a/ff.ligaairs in accordance with the external and internal frameworks and its Charter. The Board must ensure that Nordea's legal and organisational structure is appropriate and transparent with a clear allocation of functions and areas of responsibility that ensures sound and e/ff.ligaective governance, avoids the creation of complex structures and enables supervisors to conduct e/ffi.ligacient supervision.\n\nThe Board regularly follows up on Nordea's strategy, business development as well as the Company's financial position and the performance of the financial market. Furthermore, the Board regularly updates the policies and internal rules on governance and control on which it has decided. The Board also reviews the risk appetite and regularly follows up on the development of relevant risks, capital and liquidity. Significant organisational changes, certain senior management appointments as well as mergers and acquisitions and other resolutions of significance are other matters dealt with by the Board. In 2021 the Board dealt with various aspects\n\nrelated to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, handled matters related to digitalisation, internal control and compliance, financial crime, share buy-backs and dividends as well as various remediation and implementation programmes. Furthermore, the Board must ensure that the Company's organisation in respect of accounting, management of funds and the Company's financial position in general includes satisfactory controls. The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that an adequate and e/ff.ligaective system of internal control is established and maintained. Group Internal Audit (GIA) annually provides the Board with an assessment of the overall e/ff.ligaectiveness of governance and the risk and control framework, together with an analysis of themes and trends emerging from internal audit work and their impact on the organisation's risk profile. Further information regarding internal control at Nordea is provided on pages 79-82 under 'Internal Control Framework'.\n\nThe Board regularly meets the external auditor and regularly considers the need for such meetings without the presence of the President and Group CEO or any other member of the GLT. In addition, the auditor in charge regularly attends the meetings of the Board Audit Committee.\n\nIn 2021 the Board of the Company held 16 meetings, 5 of which were held as per capsulam meetings. For more information see the table on page 74.\n\n## Chair\n\nThe Chair of the Board is elected by the shareholders at the General Meeting. The Board meets according to its annual meeting schedule and as necessary. The Chair is to ensure that the Board's work is conducted e/ffi.ligaciently and that the Board fulfils its duties. The Chair is to organise and lead the Board's work, maintain regular contact with the President and Group CEO and ensure that the Board receives su/ffi.ligacient information and documentation, that the work of the Board is evaluated annually and that the Shareholders' Nomination Board is informed of the result of the evaluation.\n\n## Evaluation of the Board\n\nThe Board conducts a self-evaluation process annually, through which the performance and the work of the Board are evaluated for the purpose of continuously improving the Board's work and e/ffi.ligaciency. The evaluation is based on methodology that includes questionnaires to evaluate the Board as a whole, the Chair and the individual Board members. The result of the self-evaluation process is further discussed by the Board and presented to the Shareholders' Nomination Board by the Chair of the Board.\n\nIn accordance with applicable European regulatory requirements, a suitability assessment of the individual Board members and of the Board as a whole is completed annually and in connection with the selection process for new Board members.\n\n## Board committees\n\nIn accordance with the external framework and in order to increase the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the Board work, the Board has established separate working committees to assist the Board in preparing matters falling within the competence of the Board and to make decisions in matters delegated by the Board. The duties of the Board committees, as well as working procedures, are defined in the Committee Charters. In general, the Board committees do not have autonomous decision-making powers and each committee regularly reports on its work to the Board. Nordea follows the legal requirements and complies with the Code in terms of Board committees.",

The internal framework regulates the division of responsibilities and the interaction between the President and Group CEO and the Board. The President and Group CEO works closely with the Chair of the Board in terms of planning Board meetings.\n\nThe President and Group CEO is accountable to the Board for managing the Nordea Group's operations and organisation and is also responsible for developing and maintaining e/ff.ligaective systems for reporting and internal control within the Group.

These meetings are chaired by the President and Group CEO, who reaches decisions after having consulted with the other GLT members.

        "page_content": "## Internal Control Framework\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting and overseeing an adequate and e/ff.ligaective Internal Control Framework, covering the whole Group. The framework sets out the responsibilities of the Group Board and the senior management regarding internal control, all Group functions and business areas, including outsourced activities and distribution channels. Under the Internal Control Framework, all business areas, Group functions and units are responsible for managing the risks they incur in conducting their activities and for having controls in place that aim to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. As part of the Internal Control Framework, Nordea has established Group control functions with appropriate and su/ffi.ligacient authority, stature and access to the Board to fulfil their mission as well as the Risk Management Framework.\n\nThe Internal Control Framework ensures e/ff.ligaective and e/ffi.ligacient operations, adequate identification, measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of financial and non-financial information (both internal and external) and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, supervisory requirements and Group internal rules.\n\nThe internal control process is carried out by the governing bodies, risk management functions, management and other sta/ff.liga at Nordea. The internal control process is based on five main components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication as well as monitoring. The internal control process is created to ensure the necessary fundamentals for the entire organisation to contribute to the e/ff.ligaectiveness and high quality of internal control through, for instance, clear definitions, assignments of roles and responsibilities and common tools and procedures. Roles and responsibilities with respect to internal control and risk management are divided into three lines of defence.\n\nAccording to the Group Board Directive on Internal Governance, the first line of defence refers to all units and employees that are neither in the second nor in the third line of defence.\n\nIn the first line of defence, the business organisation and Group functions are risk owners and thus responsible for conducting their business within risk exposure limits and the risk appetite and in accordance with the Internal Control Framework.\n\nThe second line of defence consists of Group Risk, which is responsible for maintaining and monitoring the implementation of the Risk Management Framework as a fundamental part of the Internal Control Framework, and Group Compliance, which is responsible for maintaining and monitoring the implementation of the Compliance Risk Management Framework. To ensure e/ff.ligaective risk management, the second line of defence has access to all business lines and other internal units that have the potential to generate risk as well as to relevant subsidiaries and branches and outsourced activities.\n\nGIA, which is the third line of defence, performs audits and provides the Board with an assessment of the overall e/ff.ligaectiveness of governance and the risk and control framework, together with an analysis of themes and trends emerging from internal audit work and their impact on the organisation's risk profile.\n\n## Group Risk (9)\n\nGroup Risk is an independent risk function structured to carry out risk monitoring and control in line with Nordea's Internal Control Framework. As part of the second line of defence, Group Risk is responsible, in cooperation with Group Compliance, for maintaining the Risk Management Framework as\n\npart of the Internal Control Framework and for monitoring the implementation of the policies and procedures within this framework. The risk function oversees the implementation of the financial and the non-financial risk policies and, according to a risk-based approach, monitors and controls the Risk Management Framework and must, among other things, ensure that all risks to which Nordea is or could become exposed are identified, assessed, monitored, managed and reported. The risk function is headed by the CRO, who is also a member of the GLT, and reports to the President and Group CEO. The CRO is appointed, suspended or dismissed by decision of the Board after prior consultation with the President and Group CEO. The CRO regularly reports to the BRIC and the Board on the Nordea Group's risk exposure.\n\n## Group Compliance (10)\n\nGroup Compliance is an independent compliance function responsible for maintaining a compliance risk management framework that ensures compliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, supervisory requirements and related internal rules as well as for providing training, advice and oversight to ensure that compliance matters are adequately communicated and adhered to by management.\n\nGroup Compliance is responsible for identifying, assessing, testing, monitoring and reporting compliance risks to ensure that the risks are managed by the relevant business areas and functions. The compliance function is headed by the CCO, who is also a member of the GLT, and reports to the President and Group CEO. The CCO is appointed, suspended or dismissed by the Board after prior consultation with the President and Group CEO. The CCO regularly reports to the BRIC and the Board on the Nordea Group's compliance risk exposure.\n\n## Group Internal Audit (11)\n\nGroup Internal Audit (GIA) is an independent function commissioned by the Board. The BAC is responsible for guidance on and evaluation of GIA within the Nordea Group. The CAE has the overall responsibility for GIA. The CAE reports on a functional basis to the Board and the BAC and reports on an administrative basis to the President and Group CEO. The Board approves the appointment and dismissal of the CAE and decides, by proposal of the BRPC, on salary and other employment terms and conditions for the CAE.\n\nThe purpose of GIA is to support the Board and the GLT in protecting the assets, reputation and sustainability of the organisation. GIA does this by assessing whether all significant risks are identified and appropriately reported by management and the risk functions to the Board, its committees and the GLT, by assessing whether all significant risks are adequately controlled and by challenging the GLT to improve the e/ff.ligaectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls. GIA does not engage in consulting activities unless otherwise instructed by the BAC.\n\nAll activities and entities of the Group fall within the scope of GIA. GIA makes a risk-based decision as to which areas within its scope should be included in the audit plan approved by the Board.\n\nGIA must operate free from interference in determining the scope of internal auditing, in performing its audit work and in communicating its results. This means for example that GIA, via the CAE, is authorised to inform the financial supervisory authorities of any matter without further approval. The CAE has unrestricted access to the President and Group CEO and the Chair of the BAC and should meet with the Chair of the BAC informally and formally throughout the year, including without the presence of executive management.

This includes the right to sufficient and timely access to the organisation's records, systems, premises and sta/ff.liga. GIA has the right to attend and observe Board committees, the GLT, overall committees and forums for the Nordea Group and other key management decision-making forums when relevant and necessary.\n\n## External audit (12)\n\nAccording to the Articles of Association, the auditor of the Company must be an audit firm with the auditor in charge being an authorised public accountant. The term of o/ffi.ligace of the auditor expires at the end of the AGM following the election. The current auditor of the Company is PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy. Jukka Paunonen, Authorised Public Accountant, was the auditor in charge as of the 2021 AGM.\n\nFurther information about the fees paid for audit services and non-audit services is presented in Note G9.\n\n## Report on internal control and risk management regarding financial reporting\n\nThe systems for internal control and risk management of financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance about the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, applicable laws and regulations and other requirements for listed companies. The internal control and risk management activities are included in Nordea's planning and resource allocation processes. Internal control and risk management of financial reporting at Nordea are described below.\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe control environment consists of Nordea's internal controls and centres around the culture and values, established by the Board and the GLT, and the organisational structure with clear roles and responsibilities.\n\nNordea's organisational structure aims to support the overall strategy, ensure business momentum and meet the requirements on capital and liquidity.\n\nThe primary governance principle is the adherence to the three lines of defence model which provides the foundation for a clear division of roles and responsibilities in the organisation. For further information about the three lines of defence, see 'Internal Control Framework'.\n\nClear roles and responsibilities are crucial in the governance of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). The first line of defence is responsible for the ongoing risk management and for compliance with applicable rules. Risk owners in the business areas and Group functions are responsible for risk management activities. A central function supports the Group CFO in defining standards that apply to relevant controls Group wide. These controls are implemented and maintained within significant processes and monitored by quarterly self-assessments.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisk assessment in relation to reliable financial reporting involves the identification and assessment of risks of material misstatements or deficiencies. Financial reporting risk (FRR) is defined as the risk of misstatements or deficiencies in financial reporting, regulatory reporting and disclosures.\n\nRisk management is considered to be an integral part of running the business and the main responsibility for performing risk assessments regarding financial reporting risks lies with the business organisation. Performing risk assessments close to the business increases the possibility of identifying\n\nthe most relevant risks. In order to govern the quality, control functions stipulate in governing documents when and how these assessments are to be performed. Examples of risk assessments are the recurring Risk and Control Self-Assessments and the event-driven Change Risk Management and Approval process.\n\n## Control activities\n\nThe scope of the ICFR framework is designed to focus on areas where risk of material financial misstatements could exist, i.e. where the judgement of a reasonable person relying on the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the misstated item.\n\nBusiness areas and Group functions are primarily responsible for managing risks associated with the units' operations and financial reporting processes. Entity-wide controls are directive measures and governance bodies in place to set the standards for internal control, such as the Group Accounting Manual, the Group CEO Instructions on Financial Control and the Group Valuation Committee. The Group Accounting Manual contains information on the accounting policies to be used in the Group as well as detailed reporting instructions and the tools needed to produce the financial statements.\n\nThe ICFR control structure is based on transaction level controls that are identified by analysing risks based on highlevel processes with an end-to-end product focus. After deciding on the transaction level controls, an analysis is performed to determine the systems/applications to be relied on in financial reporting, including the IT general controls.\n\nThe quality assurance achieved through the management reporting process, where a detailed analysis of the financial outcome is performed, constitutes an important control mechanism in the reporting process.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nGroup Finance is responsible for ensuring that the Group Accounting Manual and other relevant directive measures are up to date and that changes are communicated to the responsible units. These are supported by detailed guidelines and standard operating procedures in the responsible units.\n\nManagement at di/ff.ligaerent levels in the organisation is provided with information about the performance and assessment of the identified key controls and details on the outcome of the self-assessment of controls in their process.\n\nNordea interacts with relevant subject-matter experts externally to keep up to date with changes in reporting expectations and ensure the fulfilment of financial reporting objectives. Nordea actively participates in relevant national and international forums, such as those established by the financial supervisory authorities, central banks and financial institution associations.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nNordea has established a process for regular self-assessment of internal controls with the purpose of ensuring proper monitoring of the quality of the financial reporting. The Group CFO reports specifically on self-assessment outcomes and other activities related to the management of financial reporting risk to the BAC on a quarterly basis.\n\nAn independent risk control function resides in the second line of defence and is responsible for identifying, controlling and reporting on FRR. In addition, GIA provides the Board with an assessment of the overall e/ff.ligaectiveness of the governance, risk management and control processes throughout the organisation, including financial reporting.\n\nThe Board, the BAC, the BRIC, the BOSC, Group Risk, Group Compliance and GIA have important roles when it comes to",

The rules are put in place to mitigate the risk of insider dealing and other forms of market abuse, and the overall responsibility for making sure that a high level of knowledge of and compliance with these rules is maintained lies with Group Compliance.\n\n## Principles for related party transactions\n\nApplicable laws and regulations set requirements for the monitoring and assessment of as well as the decision-making concerning related party transactions and the disclosure of executed related party transactions.\n\nGenerally, the Company's transactions with its related parties are part of the Company's ordinary course of business and carried out according to the same criteria and terms as those of comparable transactions with other parties of similar standing. The decision-making processes have furthermore been structured in order to avoid conflicts of interest and to comply with the statutory decision-making requirements.\n\nThe Company has defined its related parties in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and keeps an up-todate record of its related parties. Relevant internal stakehold-\n\ners, such as customer responsible units, other relevant business units and Group functions, are informed of the list of related parties and thereto related restrictions, in order to monitor transactions with such parties.\n\nNordea is also bound by applicable close circle rules and has processes in place for identifying the persons belonging to the close circle of Nordea and for ensuring that credits and comparable financing granted to such persons as well as any investments in an entity belonging to the close circle are in accordance with applicable laws and rules.\n\nPursuant to the Company's Conflict of Interest Policy, employees, management and the members of the Board must not handle matters on behalf of Nordea in cases where they or a closely associated person or company may have an interest that conflicts with the interests of Nordea or its customers. Nordea's business areas and Group functions are obliged to identify, prevent and manage actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Board has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring proper processes for the identification, reporting and supervision of related party transactions as well as the proper decision-making in this respect. The BAC must assist the Board in monitoring and assessing how related party transactions meet the requirements of ordinary activities and the arm's length terms.\n\nRelated party transactions that are not part of the Company's ordinary course of business or are made in deviation from customary commercial terms require a decision by the Board for the related party transaction to be carried out, unless otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations. In respect of such related party transactions the Board must ensure that:\n\n(i) the relevant transactions have been appropriately identified, reported, and controlled\n\n(ii) the Conflict of Interest Policy has been carefully considered in the preparation and decision-making process  and\n\n(iii) the preparation of related party transactions includes adequate reports, statements and/or assessments.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration\n\nNordea has a clear remuneration policy as well as clear remuneration instructions and processes, supporting sound remuneration structures throughout the organisation.\n\n## Aim of Nordea's Remuneration Policy\n\nNordea's Remuneration Policy (internally referred to as the Group Board Directive on Remuneration):\n\n- \u00b7 Supports Nordea's ability to recruit, develop and retain highly motivated, competent and performance-oriented employees and hence support the Group strategy\n- \u00b7 Ensures that employees are o/ff.ligaered a competitive and market-aligned total reward o/ff.ligaering\n- \u00b7 Supports sustainable results and the long-term interests of shareholders by including goals directly linked to the performance of Nordea and by awarding parts of variable remuneration in shares or other instruments\n- \u00b7 Ensures that remuneration at Nordea is aligned with e/ffi.ligacient risk management, the Nordea purpose and values and applicable regulations.\n\nNordea has a total remuneration approach to compensation that recognises the importance of well-balanced but di/ff.ligaerentiated remuneration structures based on business and local market needs as well as the importance of having remuneration that is consistent with and promotes sound and e/ff.ligaective risk management and that does not encourage excessive risktaking or counteract Nordea's long-term interests.\n\nThe link between performance, risk and variable remuneration in Nordea's remuneration components is assessed annually to ensure business relevance, to ensure that all risks are addressed appropriately and to ensure compliance with applicable international and local regulations. This includes non-financial risks related to operational risks, compliance risks, reputational risks and specific remuneration-related risks. Most remuneration-related risks concern variable remuneration which, if not appropriately considered, could lead to excessive risk-taking. Risks are addressed through the regular reviews of remuneration structures as well as individual remuneration components, participants in variable remuneration plans and the potential size of potential awards and by disclosing relevant information.\n\n## Decision-making process for the Remuneration Policy\n\nNordea's Remuneration Policy sets out principles for remuneration within the Nordea Group, including how the policy is to be applied, remuneration governance and risk management as well as how employees with a material impact on the risk profile of Nordea ('material risk takers') are defined.\n\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors decides on the Remuneration Policy, taking possible risks into account, and oversees its functionality by ensuring that it is applied and followed up as proposed by the Board Remuneration and People Committee (BRPC).\n- \u00b7 In addition to Nordea's internal Remuneration Policy, Nordea's shareholders adopted, through an advisory vote, the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies at the 2020 Annual General Meeting, which applies to the remuneration to the Board of Directors, the CEO and the Deputy Managing Director and remains in force until the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe BRPC is responsible for preparing and presenting proposals to the Board of Directors on remuneration issues, considering the adopted Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies, including proposals about Nordea's Remuneration Policy and supplementary instructions. These preparations include an assessment of the Remuneration Policy and the remunera-\n\ntion system. Appropriate control functions participate in this process and provide input within their area of expertise to ensure that the Remuneration Policy is up to date and compliant.\n\nFurthermore, in collaboration with the Board Risk Committee, the BRPC performs assessments to ensure that Nordea's remuneration systems properly account for all types of risks, that liquidity and capital levels are consistent and that remuneration systems promote sound and e/ff.ligaective risk management.\n\nMoreover, as of April 2021 the remit of the BRPC was expanded to also support the Board of Directors in considering the Group Board Diversity Policy and Statement as well as monitoring the impact of diversity and inclusion policies and practices within Nordea and in reviewing and assessing talent management.\n\nThe BRPC will also review succession plans and performance for the members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT) and the Chief Audit Executive, review the structure and composition as well as the selection criteria and process for the GLT and advise on proposed GLT appointments.\n\nMore information about the composition of the BRPC and its responsibilities is provided in a separate section of 'Corporate Governance Statement 2021' on pages 73-74.\n\n## Alignment with business strategy\n\nNordea has processes to align business and individual goaland target-setting across Nordea with the overall strategy and predefined risk-adjusted criteria.\n\nFinancial and non-financial goals are based on the business's expectations and forecasts, and stretched targets are approved by the Board of Directors to ensure alignment with shareholders' and Nordea's priorities. Hence, the main Group performance goals and targets in variable remuneration for the Nordea Group in 2021 were the financial goals return on equity, income and cost-to-income ratio and non-financial goals relating to customer satisfaction and employee engagement.\n\nWhen assessing performance against the pre-determined set of well-defined goals and targets, Nordea applies an aligned structure with clear expectations for our people. Individual performance is assessed on not only 'what' is delivered but also 'how' it is delivered. A key aspect is performance in relation to specific risk and compliance targets as well as general compliance and risk conduct, which must be appropriately considered when determining variable remuneration awards.\n\nTo guarantee fair and objective remuneration decisions and to support sound governance, all individual remuneration decisions are subject to separate processes and approved in line with the grandparent principle (approval by the manager's manager).\n\n## Supporting sound risk management\n\nNordea performs an ongoing risk assessment of remuneration risks conducted within the framework of the Compliance, Conduct and Product Committee (CCPC), the non-financial risk forums of each business area and Group functions as well as the risk and control self-assessment.\n\nNordea also mitigates relevant risks by means of our internal control framework, which is based on the control environment and includes the following elements: values and management culture, goal orientation and follow-up, a clear and",

        "page_content": "transparent organisational structure, three lines of defence, the four eyes principle, the quality and e/ffi.ligaciency of internal communication and an independent assessment process.\n\nThe following principles are further examples of how sound risk management is supported:\n\n- \u00b7 Applying a group variable remuneration funding mechanism which considers prudential and appropriate riskadjustments when setting a group pool for each performance year.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that the Board of Directors approves the total outcome of variable remuneration before award, which allows for adjustments in outcome if deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors, e.g. considering risk limits.\n- \u00b7 There is an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Relevant control functions provide input on the setting of a Group variable remuneration pool, performance goals and the outcome of such, to ensure that the impact on sta/ff.liga behaviour and risks of business undertaken are addressed.\n- \u00b7 The e/ff.ligaect on long-term results is considered when determining goals and targets for variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 No employee at Nordea can earn variable remuneration exceeding 200% of their annual fixed remuneration. The maximum ratio between fixed and variable remuneration for material risk takers was 200% in 2021 in accordance with the 2019 AGM's decision. In practice, however, a ratio between the fixed and the variable remuneration above 100% of annual fixed remuneration only applies to a very limited number of employees as the outcome of Nordea's variable remuneration plans is capped at certain levels.\n- \u00b7 The risks set out in Nordea's Risk Appetite Statement are linked to forfeiture conditions to ensure that breaches of risk limits influence variable remuneration awards.\n- \u00b7 Payments related to early termination of employment should reflect performance achieved over time and should be designed to not reward failure or misconduct.\n- \u00b7 Employees engaged in control functions are compensated independently of the performance of the business unit(s) they control and predominantly through fixed remuneration.\n\n## Principles for deferral of variable remuneration awards and awards in instruments\n\nNordea ensures that a substantial part of variable remuneration, as a minimum for material risk takers, is deferred and afterwards retained over an appropriate period in line with regulatory requirements. This means that 40-60% of variable remuneration awards are deferred for four to five years, with vesting and subsequent disbursement over the deferral period on a pro rata basis.\n\nThe first disbursement of deferred variable remuneration can take place from one year into the deferral period at the earliest.\n\nDeviations may occur subject to local regulations. For material risk takers and certain other categories of sta/ff.liga, 50% of variable remuneration awards (both deferred and nondeferred amounts) are awarded in instruments (as a main rule in Nordea shares, alternatively instruments linked to Nordea's share price) and subject to a post-vesting 12-month retention period. Dividends are excluded from any shares or other instruments during a deferral period.\n\n## Risk adjustments, malus and claw-back provisions\n\nGeneral provisions for malus and claw-back at Nordea are set out in Nordea's Remuneration Policy. The Consequence Management Committee (CMC), comprising the heads of control functions, the Head of Group Legal and the Head of Group People, provides governance and oversight of risk performance-related adjustments for selected sta/ff.liga within the scope of the CMC in the first line of defence. Ex-ante and ex-post adjustments can be proposed by the CMC to individually or collectively adjust or claw back variable remuneration awards due to risk and compliance-related performance.\n\nPayment of variable remuneration awards under Nordea's main variable remuneration plans is based on an assessment of the results of the Nordea Group, the concerned Nordea entity, the relevant business unit and the individual employee. Reductions, partly or down to zero, can occur if an employee eligible for variable remuneration has for example violated internal or external regulations, participated in or been responsible for an action that has caused Nordea significant losses or in the event of a significant downturn in Nordea's or the relevant business unit's financial results.\n\nEmployees must not use personal hedging strategies to undermine or eliminate the e/ff.ligaects of deferred variable remuneration being partly or fully removed.\n\n## Audit of Nordea's Remuneration Policy\n\nThe BRPC follows up on the application of the Remuneration Policy and supplementary instructions within Nordea through an independent review by Group Internal Audit. This audit is conducted at least annually.\n\n## Remuneration to the Board of Directors\n\nBy proposal of the Shareholders' Nomination Board and in accordance with the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies, the AGM annually decides on the remuneration to the Board of Directors. In 2021 remuneration was o/ff.ligaered in cash to the Board members. Board members are not part of any variable or incentive programme. Remuneration for Board work is not paid to Board members who are employees of the Nordea Group. Further information is provided in Note G8.\n\n## Remuneration to the CEO and the members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT)\n\nBy proposal of the BRPC, the Board decides on the remuneration for the CEO and the members of the GLT, considering the adopted Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies. Remuneration for the Chief Audit Executive is also approved by the Board of Directors even though the Chief Audit Executive is not a member of the GLT. This includes a decision on fixed and variable remuneration as well as pension and other employment terms and conditions.\n\nNordea maintains a competitive and market-aligned total reward o/ff.ligaering and other employment conditions needed to recruit, motivate and retain the CEO and the members of the GLT and through their leadership, expertise and strategic decision-making to enable Nordea to deliver on its strategy and targets. A key concept is pay-for-performance.\n\nRemuneration for the CEO and members of the GLT in 2021 was decided by the Board of Directors considering the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies and in accordance with Nordea's internal policies and procedures, which are",

        "page_content": "based on the applicable regulations on remuneration systems and other relevant regulations and guidelines.\n\nSalaries and other remuneration in line with market levels constitute the overriding principle for the remuneration for the CEO and the members of the GLT at Nordea. The remuneration for the CEO and the members of the GLT will be consistent with and promote sound and e/ff.ligaective risk management and not encourage excessive risk-taking or counteract Nordea's long-term interests.\n\nAnnual remuneration consists of fixed salary, benefits, vari able remuneration (short-and long-term), pension and insurances.\n\nFurther information about remuneration to the CEO and the members of the GLT is provided in Note G8. A more detailed disclosure of remuneration to the CEO and how  the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies is applied is provided in Nordea's 2021 Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies.\n\n## Variable remuneration to the members of the GLT\n\nVariable remuneration for the members of the GLT in 2021 was o/ff.ligaered as participation in a short-term incentive programme called Executive Incentive Programme (EIP 2021). Furthermore, the members of the GLT who are not responsible for independent control functions were o/ff.ligaered participation in a long-term fully share-based incentive plan called Long Term Incentive Programme 2021-2023 (LTIP 2021-2023).\n\nThe Executive Incentive Programme (EIP 2021) for GLT members has a one-year performance period and includes pre-determined performance goals and targets at Group, business area/Group function (BA/GF) and individual level. The impact on long-term results was considered when determining the targets.\n\nThe outcome from the EIP 2021 has been based on the Board of Director's assessment of performance against the pre-determined targets.\n\nThe outcome from the EIP 2021 will be paid to GLT members in equal portions of cash and Nordea shares, and will be subject to forfeiture clauses. 40% of the confirmed outcome of the EIP 2021 will be delivered in equal portions of cash and Nordea shares in 2022. The remaining 60% of the EIP 2021 outcome is deferred for annual pro rata delivery over a fiveyear period, meaning that a significant portion of the outcome remains to be delivered at the time of the award. No dividends are paid during the deferral period. Nordea shares will be subject to 12 months' retention when delivered to the GLT members. The maximum outcome of the EIP 2021 for GLT members participating in the LTIP 2021-2023 was 75% of the annual fixed base salary.\n\nPerformance goals at Group level included financial goals measuring return on equity, income and cost-to-income ratio as well as non-financial goals measuring employee engagement and customer satisfaction. BA/GF goals included BA/ GF-specific financial and non-financial goals. At individual level, performance was measured in relation to the individually agreed goals and targets including risk and compliance. The weighting of Group, BA/ GF and individual goals is determined individually for the CEO, reflecting his overall responsibility for the Nordea Group, as well as for the members heading a business area or a Group function. The overall ambition for 2021 was to deliver on Nordea's strategic priorities. Any\n\nawards were determined on the basis of achievement in relation to the agreed goals and targets following appropriate risk adjustments.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Programme 2021-2023\n\nIn 2021 the Board of Directors decided to continue the longterm incentive programme by launching the LTIP 2021-2023 for the GLT and to a maximum of 50 senior leaders and key employees whose e/ff.ligaorts have a direct impact on Nordea's results, profitability, customer vision and long-term growth.\n\nThe main purpose of the LTIP 2021-2023 is to further align GLT members' interests with those of shareholders. The LTIP 2021-2023 has a three-year performance period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 and subsequent deferral and retention according to regulations.\n\nThe total maximum number of shares that can be granted under the LTIP 2021-2023 was nominally allocated to the participants in 2021 as conditional share awards. In 2024, based on Nordea's performance against pre-established performance criteria, the maximum number of shares or a proportion of the shares will be awarded individually to the participants.\n\nThe first portion of shares of the potential award will be delivered in 2024. The rest of the shares will be deferred and delivered annually in five equal portions during 2025-2029. Each share delivery is subject to a 12-month retention period.\n\nShare grants may be reduced in part or full subject to risk and compliance adjustments. The LTIP 2021-2023 performance requirements have been set so that the maximum outcome will require achieving exceptional performance from a shareholder perspective. The assessment of performance during the performance period will be based equally on the following performance criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Relative total shareholder return (rTSR) measured against selected Nordic and European peer banks\n- \u00b7 Absolute total shareholder return (absolute TSR)\n- \u00b7 Absolute cumulative earnings per share (absolute EPS).\n- \u00b7 A risk-adjustment underpin is also included.\n\nFurthermore, the GLT members must hold a significant number of the shares subsequently granted until the total value of the GLT member's shareholding in Nordea in total corresponds to 100% of the GLT member's annual gross salary. Such shares must be held until the GLT member steps down from the GLT position.\n\nBenefits are provided as part of the total reward o/ff.ligaering to the CEO and GLT members. The levels of these benefits are determined by what is considered fair in relation to general market practice. Fixed salary during the period of notice and severance pay will not exceed 24 months of fixed salary in total.\n\nPension and insurance are o/ff.ligaered to ensure an appropriate standard of living after retirement as well as personal insurance coverage during employment. The CEO and the members of the GLT are o/ff.ligaered pension benefits in accordance with market practice in their country of permanent residence. Pension and insurance provisions are in accordance with local laws, regulations and market practice. Pension is generally o/ff.ligaered as defined contribution pension plans, but can also be o/ff.ligaered by means of a pension allowance. Discretionary pension benefits are not used.",

        "page_content": "## Nordea's remuneration structures\n\nNordea's remuneration structure comprises fixed remuneration and variable remuneration.\n\n## Fixed remuneration components\n\nFixed base salary should remunerate for role and position and is a/ff.ligaected by job complexity, responsibility, performance and local market conditions.\n\nAllowance is a predetermined fixed remuneration component tied to the employee's role and position. The fixed base salary is, however, the cornerstone of all fixed remuneration. Allowances are not linked to performance and do not incentivise risk-taking.\n\nPension and insurance aim at ensuring an appropriate standard of living for employees after retirement as well as personal insurance coverage during employment. Pension and insurance provisions are in accordance with local laws, regulations and market practice and are either collectively agreed schemes or company-determined schemes or a combination. Nordea aims to have defined contribution pension schemes.\n\nBenefits at Nordea are awarded as part of the total reward o/ff.ligaering that is either individually agreed or based on local laws, market practice, collective bargaining agreements and company-determined practice.\n\n## Nordea's variable remuneration programmes for others than the CEO and the GLT\n\nNordea has, as of 2020, implemented a Group variable remuneration funding mechanism to fund variable remuneration programmes at Nordea, except for the Profit Sharing Plan and Nordea's LTIP (2020-2022 and 2021-2023). The Group variable remuneration pool creates a strong link between Nordea's overall performance and the allocated variable remuneration.\n\nThe Group variable remuneration pool determines the overall variable remuneration for the respective performance year based on a target/expected pool adjusted by Group performance, which is subsequently distributed to BAs/GFs based on their performance (scorecards). The final allocation is based on individual performance according to the goals set individually under the individual variable remuneration programmes. In 2021 the following other variable remuneration programmes were o/ff.ligaered to Nordea employees:\n\nExecutive Incentive Programme (EIP) was o/ff.ligaered to recruit, motivate and retain selected people leaders and key employees outside of the GLT and aims to reward strong performance and e/ff.ligaorts. The assessment of individual performance is based on a predetermined set of well-defined financial as well as non-financial goals. Individual EIP awards will not exceed the annual fixed salary. Awards from the EIP 2021 are normally, and always for material risk takers, allocated partly in cash and partly in instruments with subsequent retention. Parts of the awards for participants in the EIP are subject to a four-to-five-year pro rata deferral period, in certain exceptions three years, with forfeiture conditions applying during the deferral period.\n\nVariable Salary Part (VSP) was o/ff.ligaered to selected people leaders and specialists to reward strong performance. The assessment of individual performance is based on a predetermined set of well-defined financial as well as non-financial goals. The VSP maximum outcome for 2021 should normally not exceed a maximum outcome of 50% of the annual fixed salary and will not exceed the annual fixed salary. Awards from VSP are paid in cash. For material risk takers, VSP awards are partly delivered in instruments with subsequent retention. Parts of the awards for material risk takers and certain other participants from VSP are subject to at least a fouryear pro rata deferral period, in certain exceptions three years, with forfeiture conditions applying during the deferral period.\n\nBonus schemes were o/ff.ligaered only to selected groups of employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board of Directors, e.g. in Large Corporates & Institutions, Nordea Asset Management, in Nordea Funds and within Group Treasury. The aim is to ensure strong performance and to maintain cost flexibility for Nordea. Individual awards are determined based on detailed performance assessments covering a range of financial and non-financial goals. 2021 bonus awards from bonus schemes are paid in cash. For material risk takers, awards are partly delivered in instruments with subsequent retention. Parts of the awards for material risk takers and certain other participants in a bonus scheme are subject to a four-to-five-year pro rata deferral period, in certain exceptions three years, with forfeiture conditions applying during the deferral period.",

        "page_content": "## Conflicts of interest policy\n\nAs a global financial services provider, Nordea Bank Abp and its subsidiaries (Nordea) regularly face potential or actual conflict of interest situations. Managing conflicts of interest is relevant at both the individual and institutional level of Nordea's organisation. Nordea is committed to promoting market integrity and fair treatment of customers. All employees are required to act in a fair, honest and professional manner and in the best interests of Nordea's customers. In order to act upon these commitments and ensure appropriate governance of Nordea, it is essential to have e/ff.ligaective controls in place regarding conflicts of interest. The purpose of the Group Board Directive on Conflicts of Interest (the Directive) is to outline Nordea's approach to managing conflicts of interest and to enable developing and maintaining an e/ff.ligaective control environment.\n\nThe Directive applies to all employees and people working on behalf of Nordea, senior management, Group Board members and the President and Group CEO of Nordea. The Directive also applies to all branches and subsidiaries.\n\nBoth actual and potential conflicts of interest must be identified and e/ff.ligaective measures decided upon to prevent or manage risks in respect of Nordea or its customers. Conflicts of interest arising with regard to an employee's private interest or their past or present personal or professional relationships are individual conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest that do not arise from a private interest but in connection with\n\nNordea's organisation, Group structure, governance, di/ff.ligaerent activities, roles, products, services or any other circumstances are institutional conflicts of interest. In connection with each identified conflict of interest, the potential customer impact is assessed to ensure fair treatment of customers.\n\nAll potential or actual conflicts of interest must be identified and assessed. Appropriate preventive or mitigating measures must be implemented in the form of e/ff.ligaective organisational and administrative measures. Identified conflicts of interest are documented in a register.\n\nAll identified individual conflicts of interest or changed circumstances must be reported to the manager of the individual employee involved. All conflicts of interest or changed circumstances regarding an institutional conflict of interest must be reported to the manager responsible for the area that the conflict of interest potentially impacts. Senior management will receive recurring, at least annual, reporting on institutional conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Group Board approves the Directive and is responsible for overseeing its implementation. To ensure objective and impartial decision-making, Group Board members are also subject to the requirements of the Directive. The President and Group CEO and Group Leadership Team members are accountable for implementing the Directive at Nordea while also being subject to the requirements of the Directive.",

        "page_content": "## Non-financial statement\n\nThis report constitutes Nordea's non-financial statement for the financial year 2021. The report covers the parent company Nordea Bank Abp and its subsidiaries.\n\nIn 2021 Nordea was present in 21 countries, including its four Nordic home markets - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Through Nordea's four business areas - Personal Banking, Business Banking, Large Corporates & Institutions and Asset & Wealth Management - Nordea o/ff.ligaers a wide range of products and services.\n\nAs a financial institution, Nordea's business model is to create value for its customers, investors, employees, shareholders and society in general. For a sustainable business model to succeed, value cannot only include monetary means, but must encompass environmental and societal responsibility, employee-related matters, anti-corruption measures and respect for human rights.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the related uncertainty continued throughout 2021 and impacted both Nordea's operations and society at large. Nordea's Global Crisis Management team and country crisis management teams monitored the situation and took necessary actions. For more information on the financial and operational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Nordea, as well as the measures taken to address these impacts, see 'Sustainable banking' on pages 28-40, 'Other information' on page 50 and pages 160-162 in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\n## Material sustainability topics and targets\n\nAs a member of the core group of founding banks and a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking, Nordea is committed to the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Nordea has developed a long-term plan to fully integrate sustainability into its business strategy focusing on the sustainability topics where Nordea can have a material impact, either through reducing its negative impact or increasing its positive impact. The identified material topics were grouped into four strategic pillars: financial strength, climate action, social responsibility, and governance and culture. These are connected to mediumterm targets and the climate action pillar also to long-term objectives. The targets and objectives were approved by the President and Group CEO in the Group Leadership Team (GLT) in November 2020 and by the Board of Directors (the Board) in December 2020. This year, we revised and further strengthened our targets and the Board decided to include environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets in executive remuneration programmes. All targets are presented on pages 315-328 in 'Sustainability notes'.\n\n## Financial strength\n\nUnderstanding and managing ESG risks is crucial to maintaining financial strength. Therefore, in tandem with the overall strategic sustainability agenda, Nordea is developing a comprehensive approach to identifying, assessing, responding to and disclosing ESG-related risks in line with supervisory and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Strategic management of ESG-related risks\n\nDefinitions for ESG-related risks in Nordea's risk taxonomy were revised in 2021 for financial risks to reflect the treatment of ESG factors as drivers of existing risk categories: ESG-related credit risk, ESG-related compliance risk, ESG-related operational risk, ESG-related market risk, ESG-related liquidity risk and ESG-related business model risk. A new internal guideline on ESG-related risks was approved during 2021 and provides coherent cross-risk area guidance for embedding ESG factors\n\nin the relevant risk area frameworks and processes in line with supervisory and regulatory guidance. A new policy framework structure for ESG-related risks further defines how the guideline requirements are to be implemented in internal rules.\n\nNordea has adopted guidelines for climate-vulnerable sectors, with a 2021-2024 time frame, as an integral part of its Group ESG implementation programme. Deep dives for three initial sector portfolios - oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore; shipping; and mining and supporting activities - were conducted in 2021. The total exposure to these three sectors amounted to EUR 6,775m or 5% of total corporate loans at the end of 2021. For more information about ESG-related risks and climate-vulnerable sectors see Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\n## Managing ESG-related risks in relation to customers\n\nIn relation to its customers, Nordea's Code of Conduct is the central steering document for its financing operations together with its principles on ESG in financing, investing and advice in its Sustainability Policy.\n\n## Integrating climate risk into investment decisions\n\nNordea recognises climate-related risks as a material risk category for assets under management. In 2021 Nordea continued its work to further develop and enhance capabilities to integrate climate-related risk and other financial and ESGrelated risks and opportunities into Nordea's investment processes and thereby enhance risk-adjusted returns. Nordea assesses material climate-related risks and opportunities using a range of models and data sets. For listed equities and corporate bond exposures, Nordea uses the MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk (Climate VaR) model to assess transition risks and physical risks under di/ff.ligaerent climate scenarios in both Nordea Life & Pension (NLP) and Nordea Asset Management (NAM). Climate risk metrics are integrated into NAM's and NLP's risk reporting.\n\n## Climate action\n\nNordea's objectives for the business are to achieve net-zero emissions by the end of 2050 at the latest and to reduce carbon emissions across our lending and investment portfolios by 40-50% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019. To support the target-setting and to deliver on Nordea's long-term objectives Nordea joined The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) in December 2020 and has accordingly estimated its financed emissions for the asset classes: business loans, road motor vehicles loans, mortgages, listed equities, corporate fixed income and commercial real estate investment. 2021 disclosures are provided for business loans to oil and gas exploration and production; business loans to the shipping sector; and investments in listed equities for NAM and NLP as well as investments in real estate for NLP.\n\n## Policies and guidelines\n\nNordea's commitments in relation to climate change are described in the Position Statement on Climate Change. It states, among other things, Nordea's position in relation to thermal coal, coal mining and extraction of oil sands. In addition, several sector guidelines address the climate issue. In 2021, Nordea also updated the sector guidelines for the fossil fuels industry where  the bank implemented new exclusions and established phase-out policies.\n\nAll NAM funds are managed according to NAM's Responsible Investment Policy. In 2021 Nordea expanded the scope of",

        "page_content": "NAM's fossil fuel policy to include even more funds. The policy requires fossil fuel companies to demonstrate that they have a decarbonisation strategy consistent with global warming of 2\u00b0C or lower to be eligible for inclusion. In 2021 Nordea strengthened NLP's governance and policy framework for ESG areas and climate change and issued a new Responsible Investment Policy and a new Climate Change Policy.\n\n## Internal carbon footprint\n\nAlthough Nordea's greatest impact on the climate is through financing and investments, work is also ongoing to reduce the climate impact from internal operations. The 2030 objective is to reduce carbon emissions from internal operations by more than 50% compared with 2019, with a 30% reduction by the end of 2023.\n\nEach year Nordea strives to make its carbon reporting more complete. In 2019 Nordea added postal services, paper and water, and in 2020 emissions from waste were included for the first time. Despite the wider scope of its carbon footprint, Nordea has managed to reduce the emissions from internal operations for two years running. The total emissions of 11,327 (15,898) tonnes of CO2 in 2021 marked a 73% reduction from the 2019 level. The reduction in carbon emissions was mainly due to a changed travel policy and employees working from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Social responsibility\n\nSocial responsibility is about taking sustainability issues such as human rights, labour rights and gender equality into consideration throughout the entire value chain.\n\n## Human rights\n\nHuman rights are included in Nordea's Code of Conduct, Sustainability Policy, Responsible Investment Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct and in Nordea's sector guidelines when relevant for specific industries. To ensure adequate awareness of human rights, all Nordea employees are required to complete annual Code of Conduct training as part of their Licence to Work. At Nordea, human rights are addressed in all parts of the organisation and due diligence processes. Nordea has identified its most critical areas in terms of human rights as being within investing, financing, transactions and sourcing.\n\nNordea included human rights in the norm-based screening of all its funds and as at December 2021 Nordea had 10 companies on its exclusion list due to violations of human rights-related norms, including violations of the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nIn the event that Nordea identifies human rights violations for a customer, action is taken to review the credit assessment.\n\n## Inclusive work environment\n\nAt Nordea all forms of discrimination is condemned. Nordea has zero tolerance of any form of harassment, bullying or victimisation. In 2021 1.2% (1.3%) of the respondents to Nordea's People Pulse survey stated that they had been subject to some sort of harassment or other mistreatment. In 2021, 27 (10) harassment cases were reported through various channels, including the whistleblowing function Raise Your Concern (RYC).\n\n## Employment\n\nNordea's employee survey, People Pulse, enables Nordea to measure the engagement levels and well-being of its people and also to monitor signs of changing trends to enable taking swift action. The response rate to the People Pulse survey increased to 83% in 2021 compared with 81% in 2020 with all questions showing a positive trend.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nCommunity engagement at Nordea is about creating positive change through its employees. Through well over 20 programmes and partnerships, Nordea focuses on building financial skills and fostering entrepreneurship, thus enabling banking and financial expertise to have a positive impact on society.\n\nWith most of the activities based on face-to-face interaction, varying degrees of lockdown impacted e/ff.ligaorts in 2021. Despite this, close to 1,100 Nordea employees delivered 6,500 hours of volunteering in 2021, which is in line with the 2020 level and around 25% of the 2019 level.\n\n## Governance and culture\n\nOnly by strengthening its purpose-led culture with a sound and strong operating model can Nordea enable speed and scale in the transition to a sustainable and resilient economy.\n\n## Sustainability governance\n\nAt Board level the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee (BOSC) assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability, which include strategy, operational model, reporting and frameworks.\n\nThe Board is also assisted by the Board Risk Committee (BRIC) in the fulfilment of its oversight responsibilities concerning the management of risks, related frameworks, controls and processes including ESG factors as drivers of existing risk.\n\nFor more information about Nordea's governance see 'Corporate Governance Statement 2021'.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nIn 2021 Nordea fully integrated sustainability screenings and engagements into the daily practices of its sourcing managers, and all suppliers (old and new) in its central database with whom Nordea has an active agreement are now subject to screening and continuous monitoring.\n\nFor more information about sustainable procurement and supply chain data see pages 327-328 in 'Sustainability notes'.\n\n## Preventing financial crime\n\nNordea fully recognises the threat that societies face from human tra/ffi.ligacking, terrorism, corruption, drug smuggling, tax evasion and other forms of illegal activities and does its best to ensure that its resources, products and services are not used to facilitate financial crime.\n\nTracking down and stopping the flow of money from these activities is a key way to disrupt the criminals involved. Therefore, as a financial institution, Nordea is uniquely positioned to be part of the solution. Nordea commits to complying with the laws and regulations relevant to anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, sanctions, and antibribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\nFor more information about how Nordea works with financial crime prevention see Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'.",

        "page_content": "## Data privacy and cyber security\n\nKeeping personal data safe is part of Nordea's commitment to being a safe and trusted bank. Data privacy is therefore an integral part of Nordea's business and operations and an important element of its digital strategy. In 2021 Nordea continued to enhance its ability to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws in the jurisdictions where it operates.\n\nIntroducing new technologies, exploring new ways of doing business and connecting with customers widen banks' attack surface. At the same time, entities that pose cyber threats are becoming more organised, resourceful and experienced. Banks must also deal with the asymmetry of having to protect all assets while entities engaged in cyber threats merely need to find one weak spot. Combined, these factors pose an unprecedented risk to the banking industry.\n\nFor more information about how Nordea works with data privacy and cyber security see page 327 in 'Sustainability notes'.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nThe whistleblowing function, RYC, ensures that all of Nordea's stakeholders, including customers, partners, a/ff.ligaected communities as well as Nordea's own employees have the right to speak up and always feel safe in doing so if they have concerns about suspected misconduct such as breaches of human rights or irregularities such as fraudulent, inappropriate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activity or behaviour in operations, products or services. This includes any action that constitutes a violation of laws or regulations or of Nordea's internal policies, instructions or guidelines.\n\nEmployees can report openly by providing name and contact details as all reports are handled with strict confidentiality or via an electronic reporting channel, WhistleB, which is managed by an external party.\n\n## Responsible taxpayer\n\nNordea's tax policy is constituted by the Group CEO Instructions on Tax, which defines Nordea's overall tax governance, including roles and responsibilities in connection with tax charges and related reporting to the tax authorities. Nordea is a substantial corporate income taxpayer in its main countries of operation - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden - and pays corporate income tax, social security contributions and bank levies i.e. contributions to deposit guarantee schemes and resolution funds, in all the countries of operation as required by law.\n\nFor more information about tax payments see pages 326327 in 'Sustainability notes'.\n\n## EU taxonomy disclosures\n\n## EU taxonomy supporting the transition\n\nThe EU taxonomy, Regulation (EU) 2020/852, together with supplementing delegated acts, identifies environmentally sustainable economic activities. The definition of sustainable activities is based on technical screening criteria (TSC) which include definitions of when an activity significantly contributes to one of EU's climate and environmental objectives, while at the same time not significantly harming any of the other objectives. In addition, minimum social safeguard requirements need to be met. Eligible activities are those which are identified in the taxonomy, having the potential to meet the TSC. The fact that an economic activity is taxonomy-eligible does not give any indication of the environmental performance and sustainability of that activity. Identifying taxonomy-eligible economic activities is the first step towards assess-\n\ning the alignment of economic activities with the TSC and the EU taxonomy eligibility disclosures serve to help prepare for future alignment disclosures. Going forward, the proportion of EU taxonomy-aligned assets and investments will likely increase over time as data quality, coverage and accessibility improves, the scope of the EU taxonomy widens and companies transition towards alignment with the EU taxonomy criteria.\n\nIn 2021 Nordea launched a long-term plan to fully integrate sustainability into its business strategy to help drive a more sustainable future. Nordea has introduced long-term objectives and medium-term targets, for instance, to increase facilitation in sustainable financing. An integral part of Nordea's strategy is to engage with customers and investees on sustainability topics as well as to enable customers to make sustainable choices and to transition to a sustainable business model. The products and solutions Nordea o/ff.ligaers are a strategic component to support its customers' transition journey, and Nordea educates its advisers to help customers find sustainable o/ff.ligaerings.\n\nNordea plans to adjust the requirements for both its investment product providers and its own investment products going forward and update pre-contractual disclosures and periodic reporting according to the EU taxonomy. In 2021 Nordea made updates to its Green Bond Framework (GBF) aligning some of the green criteria with the TSC. Nordea updated the GBF with green covered bond content, adding green covered asset categories based on the EU taxonomy with specific criteria aligning with the TSC. In 2022 Nordea will continue to analyse options of further alignment of the framework with the EU taxonomy and to prepare for the EU Green Bond Standard.\n\n## Nordea's approach\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea focused on interpreting the EU taxonomy requirements and developing the reporting methodology. Nordea has initiated work on creating a data foundation to structure and store the data to assess the EU taxonomy eligibility of its exposures, as well as building a foundation for the upcoming reporting on alignment. Nordea's disclosure approach for 2021 reflects the banks understanding and interpretation of the requirements of the EU taxonomy and guidance from the Commission pending the implementation across all market participants and the development of common standards and approaches.\n\n## Data and methodology\n\nNordea's EU taxonomy disclosures for 2021 relate to exposures to taxonomy eligible and non-eligible assets. Nordea has assessed what assets are in scope for 2021 and where actual information is available from its customers. The only assets that are in scope of the reporting obligations for 2021 and that Nordea has actual information about are household mortgages. The data used for the reporting originates from Nordea's internal core banking systems, which captures product classification.\n\nThe numbers may change over time as Nordea obtains more granular data on which mortgages are fully taxonomy eligible. As the disclosure requirements under the taxonomy regulation started to apply on 1 January 2022, Nordea does not have actual information for 2021 about the eligible activities of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) undertakings to which Nordea has exposures. Therefore, these have not been included as eligible or non-eligible assets for 2021.",

It is Nordea's expectation that the estimates will be replaced by actual information in the coming years, as NFRD undertakings start to report their eligibility and alignment.\n\n## Data and methodology\n\nThe estimates are based on a combined approach, looking at NACE codes and an expected coverage provided by the EU Commission Joint Research Center (JRC). At first, where activities in the EU taxonomy refer to NACE codes, we have compared the description of the activity with the corresponding o/ffi.ligacial NACE code description. If the description of the activity corresponds well with the o/ffi.ligacial NACE code description, the exposure to customers registered with the corresponding NACE code (as self-reported into national company registers) was included in full as eligible. It should be noted that such correspondence applied only to a small portion of the identified assets.\n\nIf the o/ffi.ligacial NACE code description and the description of the activity in the EU taxonomy do not correspond well, or if the EU taxonomy only provides examples of NACE codes to identify eligible activities, an expected coverage provided by\n\nthe EU Commission Joint Research Center (JRC) has been used. The JRC coverage describes the expected alignment of a certain economic activity with the EU taxonomy, and as such will generally provide a lower outcome than an eligibility proxy. For instance, the JRC coverage has been used for activities within the manufacturing sector, since it includes a wide range of economic activities also outside the scope of the EU taxonomy.\n\nBy using this combined approach, Nordea aims to better reflect the level of uncertainty and avoid overstating the share of eligible assets. Nevertheless, the approach has certain limitations. The NACE code reported by a customer may not reflect all of their business activities correctly, as companies may engage in a wider range of activities than indicated by the NACE code. Thus, the applied NACE proxy per customer may under- or overestimate the eligibility of that customer's activities. Furthermore, the JRC proxy is a proxy for alignment, not eligibility, which likely leads to an underestimation of the eligibility ratio. Additionally, the JRC proxy will only capture eligible activities with the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation, not climate change adaptation. When estimating taxonomy-eligible assets of NFRD companies, only turnover has been considered, not CAPEX.\n\nAs further guidance on the EU taxonomy is issued by the regulators, as market practice develops and as customers disclose their eligibility, our methodology is likely to be updated. This could result in fluctuations in disclosed numbers and it is not ruled out that the data will deviate significantly from the numbers presented in the table below.\n\n## Estimated eligibility disclosures 2021 1\n\n| Assets                                                               | Exposures in  EURm   | Proportion of   covered assets 2   | Proportion  of    total assets   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Taxonomy-eligible assets 3                                           | 162,545              | 41%                                | 32%                              |\n| Estimated taxonomy-eligible assets 4                                 | 7,844                | 2%                                 | 1%                               |\n| Estimated taxonomy non-eligible assets 4                             | 96,343               | 24%                                | 19%                              |\n| Loans to households 5                                                | 8,338                | 2%                                 | 2%                               |\n| Derivatives                                                          | 30,198               | 8%                                 | 6%                               |\n| Assets related to non-NFRD undertakings 6                            | 92,180               | 23%                                | 18%                              |\n| On demand inter-bank loans                                           | 940                  | 0%                                 | 0%                               |\n| Assets related to central governments, central banks, supranationals | 76,220               |                                    | 15%                              |\n| Trading portfolio                                                    | 33,834               |                                    | 7%                               |",

        "page_content": "## Proposed distribution of earnings\n\nOn 31 December 2021, Nordea Bank Abp's distributable earnings, including profit for the financial year - after subtracting capitalised development expenses - were EUR 18,877,626,213.72 1 and other unrestricted equity amounted to EUR 4,602,069,524.60.\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes that the 24 March 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) authorise it to decide on a dividend payment, in one or several instalments, of a maximum of EUR 2,681,667,380.00. The payment would be distributed based on the balance sheet to be adopted for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and the authorisation would remain in force until the beginning of the next AGM.\n\nOn 31 December 2021 the total number of shares in Nordea Bank Abp was 3,932,780,127. The dividend per share will be determined based on the total number of outstanding shares on the dividend decision date. Dividend will not be paid to shares held by Nordea on the dividend record date.\n\n## According to the parent company's balance sheet as at 31 December 2021 the unrestricted equity amounted to:\n\n| EUR                               |                   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Invested unrestricted equity      | 1,089,835,752.45  |\n| Retained earnings 1               | 15,645,531,691.65 |\n| Other free funds                  | 2,762,284,827.88  |\n| Net profit for the year           | 3,232,094,522.07  |\n| Additional Tier 1 capital holders | 749,948,944.27    |\n| Total                             | 23,479,695,738.32 |\n\n- 1)  Capitalised development costs of EUR 1,580,682,406.02 have been subtracted from Retained earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe dividend will be paid to shareholders who on the record date for dividend payment are recorded in Nordea's shareholders' register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy in Finland, Euroclear Sweden AB in Sweden and VP Securities A/S in Denmark.\n\n## Events after the financial period\n\n## Share buy-backs and share cancellations\n\nAfter 31 December 2021, Nordea has further acquired 56,483,392 shares, which correspond to a EUR 592,834,375.24 reduction of retained earnings, under its inaugural share buyback programme that started on 22 October 2021. On 8 February 2022 Nordea's application to further repurchase up to EUR 1.0bn of its own shares was approved by the ECB. Nordea expects to initiate a follow-on share buy-back programme of up to EUR 1.0bn after the inaugural programme has ended. If the follow-on programme had been in place on 31 December 2021, it would have reduced the Group CET1 ratio by around 65bp. Aggregated amounts of 34,726,349 and\n\n37,851,662 treasury shares, which were held for capital optimisation purposes and acquired through share buy-backs, were cancelled in January and February, respectively. After the cancellations, the total number of shares in Nordea is 3,892,983,149.\n\n## Regulatory developments\n\nNordea received the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) decision on 2 February 2022, which includes the decision to maintain the current Pillar 2 requirement of 1.75% (of which 0.98% is to be met with CET1 capital).\n\nThe dividend would be paid from retained earnings. After a maximum dividend payout of EUR 2,681,667,380.00, an amount of EUR 16,195,958,833.72 would be carried forward as distributable retained earnings.\n\nIt is the assessment of the Board of Directors that the proposed dividend is justifiable considering the demands with respect to the size of the Company's and the Group's equity, which are imposed by the nature, scope and risks, associated with the business, and the Company's and the Group's need for consolidation, liquidity and financial position in general.\n\nFor information on changes in the financial position of the\n\nNordea Bank Abp since the end of the financial period see 'Events after the financial period'. No other significant events or material changes have taken place in the financial position of the Company since the end of the financial period and the proposed dividend does not compromise the Company's solvency.\n\n## The Board of Directors proposes that earnings be distributed as follows (calculated based on the maximum dividend of EUR 2,681,667,380.00):\n\n| EUR                               |                   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Dividend paid to shareholders     | 2,681,667,380.00  |\n| Invested unrestricted equity      | 1,089,835,752.45  |\n| Retained earnings 1               | 16,195,958,833.72 |\n| Other free funds                  | 2,762,284,827.88  |\n| Additional Tier 1 capital holders | 749,948,944.27    |\n| Total                             | 23,479,695,738.32 |",

It measures the capital required to cover unexpected losses in the course of Nordea's business with a certain probability. Economic capital uses advanced internal models to provide a consistent measurement for credit risk, market risk, operational risk, business risk and life insurance risk arising from activities in Nordea's various business areas.\n\nThe aggregation of risks across the Group gives rise to diversification e/ff.ligaects resulting from the di/ff.ligaerences in risk drivers and the improbability that unexpected losses occur simultaneously.\n\n## Equity per share\n\nEquity as shown on the balance sheet after full dilution and non-controlling interests excluded divided by the number of shares after full dilution.\n\n## Equity ratio\n\nTotal equity as a percentage of total assets at end of the year.\n\n## Impairment rate (stage 3), gross\n\nImpaired loans (stage 3) before allowances divided by total loans measured at amortised cost before allowances.\n\n## Impairment rate (stage 3), net\n\nImpaired loans (stage 3) after allowances divided by total loans measured at amortised cost before allowances.\n\n## Net loan loss ratio, amortised cost\n\nNet loan losses (annualised) divided by closing balance of the carrying amount of loans to the public (lending) measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Non-servicing, not impaired\n\nPast due loans, not impaired due to future cash flows (included in Loans, not impaired).\n\n## Own funds\n\nOwn funds include the sum of Tier 1 capital and the supplementary capital consisting of subordinated loans, after deduction of the carrying amount of the shares in whollyowned insurance companies and the potential deduction for expected shortfall.\n\n## Price to Book\n\nNordea's stock market value relative to its book value of total equity.\n\n## Return on equity\n\nNet profit for the year as a percentage of average equity for the year. Additional Tier 1 capital, accounted for in equity, is classified as a financial liability in the calculation.

Corporate information and basis of presentation\n\nNordea Bank Abp (Business ID 2858394-9), together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the Nordea Group), is a leading universal bank in the Nordic markets. The parent company, Nordea Bank Abp, is a public limited liability company organised under the laws of Finland with its head o/ffi.ligace  located in Helsinki, Finland at the following address: Hamnbanegatan (Satamaradankatu) 5, FI-00020 Nordea, Helsinki, Finland. Nordea Bank Abp's ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq Nordic, the stock exchanges in Helsinki (in euro), Stockholm (in Swedish krona) and Copenhagen (in Danish krone) and its American Depository Receipts (ADR) are traded in the US in US dollars.\n\nThe Nordea Group o/ff.ligaers a comprehensive range of banking and financial products and services to household and cor-\n\nporate customers, including financial institutions. The Nordea Group's products and services comprise a broad range of household banking services, including mortgages and consumer loans, credit and debit cards, and a wide selection of savings, life insurance and pension products. In addition, the Nordea Group o/ff.ligaers a wide range of corporate banking services, including business loans, cash management, payment and account services, risk management products and advisory services, debt and equity-related products for liquidity and capital raising purposes, as well as corporate finance, institutional asset management services and corporate life and pension products. The Nordea Group also distributes general insurance products.\n\nNordea's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the EU Commission. In addition, certain complementary rules in the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines and the Decree of the Finnish Ministry of Finance on the financial statements and consolidated statements of credit institutions and investment firms have also been applied.\n\nThe disclosures, required in the standards, recommendations and legislation above, have been included in the notes or in other parts of the financial statements.\n\nOn 23 February 2022 the Board of Directors approved the financial statements, subject to final adoption by the Annual General Meeting on 24 March 2022.\n\nThe accounting policies, methods of computation and presentations are unchanged in comparison with the Annual Report 2020, except for the items presented in 'Changed accounting policies and presentation' below.\n\nAll amounts are in euro million unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 2. Changed accounting policies and presentation\n\nChanges to the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines and the Decree of the Finnish Ministry of Finance on the financial statements and consolidated statements of credit institutions and investment firms have not had any significant impact on Nordea's financial statements.\n\nThe new accounting requirements implemented during 2021 and their impact on Nordea's financial statements are described below.\n\n## Changed presentation of interest from derivatives used in economic hedges\n\nAs of 1 January 2021 the interest components of derivatives hedging assets in economic hedges have been classified as 'Other interest income' and the interest components of derivatives hedging liabilities in economic hedges have been classified as 'Interest expense' in the income statement. Previously, both types of interest component were classified as 'Interest expense'. The new principle better reflects the economic substance of  hedging transactions. Comparative figures have been restated accordingly and the impacts in 2021 and 2020 can be found in the table below.\n\n|                         | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   | Full year 2020   | Full year 2020   | Full year 2020   |\n|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                    | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       |\n| Other interest income   | 1,015            | -231             | 784              | 1,071            | -234             | 837              |\n| Interest expense        | -1,398           | 231              | -1,167           | -2,013           | 234              | -1,779           |\n| Net interest income     | 4,925            | -                | 4,925            | 4,515            | -                | 4,515            |\n| Impact on EPS/DEPS, EUR |                  | -                |                  |                  | -                |                  |",

        "page_content": "## G1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n\nIn 2020 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published amendments to International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 in Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2. Phase 2 of the interbank o/ff.ligaered rate (IBOR) reform includes three major areas: hedge accounting, modifications and disclosures. The amendments were implemented by Nordea on 1 January 2021. Hedge relationships in Nordea can continue as before and no material modification gains or losses have been recognised.\n\nThe amendments clarify that hedge accounting does not have to be discontinued in the event that hedged items and hedging instruments are modified due to the IBOR reform. Hedging relationships (and related documentation) must be amended to reflect modifications to the hedged item, hedging instrument and hedged risk. Any valuation adjustments resulting from the amendments are recognised as part of hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness.\n\nModifications required as a direct consequence of the IBOR reform and made on an economically equivalent basis are not accounted for as modifications to instruments measured at amortised cost. For such modifications, the e/ff.ligaective interest rate is amended in line with the modified cash flows. For more information, see note  G48 'IBOR reform'.\n\n## Other amended requirements\n\nIASB has published the following amendments which were implemented by Nordea on 1 January 2021 but have not had any significant impact on Nordea's financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts - deferral of IFRS 9\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions.\n\n## 3. Changes to IFRSs not yet applied\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nThe IASB has published the new standard IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. The new standard will change the accounting requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts.\n\nThe measurement principles will change from a non-uniform accounting policy based on the local accounting policies in the life insurance subsidiaries to a uniform accounting policy based on three measurement models: the Building Block Approach (BBA), the Variable Fee Approach (VFA) and the Premium Allocation Approach (PAA). The model application depends on the terms of the contract (long term, long term with a variable fee or short term). The three measurement models include consistent definitions of contractual cash flows, the risk adjustment margin and discounting. These definitions are based on principles similar to those for calculating the technical provisions in the Solvency II Directive. Unearned future premiums from profitable contracts will be recognised as a provision on the balance sheet and released to revenue when the insurance service is provided. Losses related to unprofitable contracts will be recognised in the income statement at the time the contract is signed.\n\nNordea is in the process of implementing the changes required by IFRS 17. So far, Nordea has not identified a need for substantial changes to the classification of contracts.\n\nNordea will apply all three measurements models. Most contracts with discretionary participation features will be measured using the VFA, while contracts without such features will be measured using the BBA. The PAA is currently expected to be used for certain portfolios of short-term risk contracts with a contract boundary of less than 12 months.\n\nDi/ff.ligaerent transition methods will be applied based on the data available at the time of transition. Nordea generally\n\nexpects to use the fair value method for contracts issued before 1 January 2016 and the full retrospective method for contracts issued later.\n\nIFRS 17 has been endorsed by the EU and is e/ff.ligaective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with earlier application permitted. Nordea does not currently intend to adopt the standard early. It is not yet possible to conclude on the impact on Nordea's financial statements or capital adequacy, but it is currently expected that the impacts on equity and the CET1 ratio will be negative at the time of transition.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n\nIn 2021 the IASB published amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction.\n\nThe amendments require companies to recognise deferred tax on particular transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to taxable and deductible temporary di/ff.ligaerences of equal amounts. Such a requirement may apply on the initial recognition of a lease liability and the corresponding right of use asset at the commencement of a lease. The requirement also applies in the context of decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities where the corresponding amounts are recognised as part of the cost of the related asset.\n\nThe amendments are e/ff.ligaective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with earlier application permitted. The standard is not yet endorsed by the EU and Nordea does not currently intend to adopt it early. The gross deferred tax assets and liabilities will be disclosed, but will be set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet if such requirements are met. Nordea's current assessment is that the amendments will not have any significant impact on its financial statements or on Nordea's capital adequacy in the period of initial application.\n\n## Other admendments to IFRS\n\nThe IASB has published the following new or amended standards that are assessed not to have any significant impact on Nordea's financial statements or capital adequacy in the period of initial application:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current as well as Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Deferral of E/ff.ligaective Date\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: Reference to Conceptual Framework\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\n- \u00b7 Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting estimates\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2/colon.ss02 Disclosure of Accounting policies.\n\n## 4. Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires, in some cases, the use of judgements and estimates by management. The actual outcome can later, to some extent, di/ff.ligaer from the estimates and the assumptions made. In this section a description is made of:",

Accounting policies, cont.\n\n- \u00b7 the sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, and\n- \u00b7 the judgements made when applying accounting policies (apart from those involving estimations) that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\nCritical judgements and estimates are in particular associated with:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value measurement of certain financial instruments\n- \u00b7 the classification of financial assets\n- \u00b7 the derecognition of financial assets\n- \u00b7 the impairment testing of:\n- - goodwill and other intangible assets and\n- - loans to the public/credit institutions\n- \u00b7 the amortisation period for capitalised software\n- \u00b7 the e/ff.ligaectiveness testing of cash flow hedges\n- \u00b7 the actuarial calculations of pension liabilities and plan assets related to employees\n- \u00b7 the actuarial calculations of insurance contracts\n- \u00b7 the valuation of investment properties\n- \u00b7 the assessment of expected lease terms and classification of leases\n- \u00b7 the classification of Additional Tier 1 instruments\n- \u00b7 assessing control for consolidation purposes\n- \u00b7 the valuation of deferred tax assets\n- \u00b7 claims in civil lawsuits and possible fines.\n\n## Fair value measurement of certain financial instruments\n\nNordea's accounting policy for determining the fair value of financial instruments is described in section 11 'Determination of fair value of financial instruments' and Note G41 'Assets and liabilities at fair value'. Critical judgements that have a significant impact on the recognised amounts for financial instruments are exercised when determining the fair value of OTC derivatives and other financial instruments that lack quoted prices or where recently observed market prices are not available, such as unlisted equities. The judgements relate to the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 The choice of valuation techniques.\n- \u00b7 The determination of when quoted prices fail to represent fair value (including the judgement of whether markets are active).\n- \u00b7 The calculation of fair value adjustments in order to incorporate relevant risk factors such as credit risk, model risk and liquidity risk.\n- \u00b7 The judgement of which market parameters are observable.\n\nThe critical judgements required when determining the fair value of financial instruments that lack quoted prices or where recently observed market prices are not available also introduce a high degree of estimation uncertainty.\n\nIn all of these instances, decisions are based on professional judgement in accordance with Nordea's accounting and valuation policies. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value using a valuation technique, levels 2 and 3 in the fair value hierarchy, was EUR 157,336m (EUR 167,700m) and EUR 114,726m (EUR 112,755m), respectively, at the end of the year. Valuation adjustments (CVA, DVA, FFVA, NFVA, close-out cost adjustment, model risk adjustment and IPV variance) made when determining the fair value of financial instruments (including those measured at fair value through other comprehensive income) amounted to EUR 121m (EUR 224m).\n\nSensitivity analysis disclosures covering the fair value of financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs can be found in Note G41 'Assets and liabilities at fair value'.\n\nEstimation uncertainty also arises at initial recognition of financial instruments that are part of larger structural transactions. Although subsequently not necessarily held at fair value such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and as there is normally no separate transaction price or active market for such individual instruments, the fair value has to be estimated.\n\n## Classification of financial assets\n\nNordea classifies financial assets based on Nordea's business model for managing the assets. When determining the business model for the bonds within the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer Nordea makes critical judgements. The bonds within the liquidity buffer are split in two portfolios. For the first portfolio Nordea has determined that the business model is to keep the bonds and collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. For the second portfolio, Nordea has determined that the business model is to manage the bonds with the objective of realising cash flows through sale. The bonds within the first portfolio are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and the bonds within the second portfolio are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). 'Interest-bearing securities' including 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral' in the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer measured at FVOCI (the first portfolio) and FVPL (the second portfolio) amounted to EUR 33,972m (EUR 33,726m) and EUR 23,548m (EUR 25,069m), respectively.\n\nNordea also classifies financial assets based on whether or not the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. Some loan contracts at Nordea include terms linking contractual cash flows to the customer's achievement of environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets. This is the case for all Swedish mortgage loans, where customers have the right to a discount if certain climate targets are met, and some corporate loans. Nordea considers these loans to be compliant with the SPPI requirements to the extent that the targets are entity specific. Nordea consequently judges a change in contractual cash flows to be a reflection of the change in credit risk triggered by the customer's fulfilment, or failure to fulfil, an ESG target.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nLoans and other financial assets where cash flows are modified, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised, and a new loan recognised, if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the old loan. Nordea applies judgements to determine if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the old loan. Nordea considers the terms and conditions to be substantially di/ff.ligaerent if the present value of the cash flows for the new loan discounted by the original interest rate di/ff.ligaers by more than 10% from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows for the old loan or if the modified cash flows are SPPI, but the original cash flows were not SPPI and vice versa. The carrying amount of loans, interest-bearing securities and financial instruments pledged as collateral on the asset side of the balance sheet amounts to EUR 412,493m (EUR 402,315m).\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nNordea's accounting policy for goodwill is described in section 16 'Intangible assets' and Note G21 'Intangible assets' lists the cash-generating units (CGUs) to which goodwill has been allocated. Also internally developed software for which",

Nordea's total goodwill amounted to EUR 1,975m (EUR 1,938m) at the end of the year. Software for which amortisation has not yet started amounted to EUR 446m (EUR 505m) at the end of the year.\n\nThe estimation of future cash flows and the calculation of the rate used to discount those cash flows are subject to estimation uncertainty. The forecast of future cash flows is sensitive to the cash flow projections for the near future (generally 3-5 years) and to the estimated sector growth rate for the period beyond 3-5 years. The growth rates are based on historical data, updated to reflect the current situation, which implies estimation uncertainty.\n\nThe derived cash flows are discounted at a rate based on the market's long-term risk-free rate of interest and yield requirements.\n\nFor information on the sensitivity to changes in relevant parameters, see Note G21 'Intangible assets'.\n\n## Impairment testing of loans to the public/credit institutions\n\nNordea's accounting policy for impairment testing of loans is described in section 14 'Loans to the public/credit institutions'.\n\nManagement is required to exercise critical judgements and estimates when calculating loan impairment allowances. Nordea's total lending before impairment allowances was EUR 349,648m (EUR 338,459m) at the end of the year. For more information, see Note G14 'Loans and impairment'.\n\nWhen calculating allowances for individually significant impaired loans, judgement is exercised to estimate the amount and timing of the expected cash flows to be received from the customers under di/ff.ligaerent scenarios, including the valuation of any collateral received. Judgement is also applied when assigning the likelihood of the di/ff.ligaerent scenarios occurring.\n\nJudgement is exercised to assess when an exposure has experienced a significant increase in credit risk. If this is the case, the provision should reflect the lifetime expected losses, as opposed to a 12-month expected loss for exposures not having increased significantly in credit risk. Judgement is also exercised in the choice of modelling approaches covering other parameters used when calculating the expected losses, such as the expected lifetime used in stage 2 as well as in the assessment of whether the parameters based on historical experience are relevant for estimating future losses.\n\nThe statistical models used to calculate provisions are based on macroeconomic scenarios, which requires management to exercise judgement when identifying such scenarios and when assigning the likelihood of the di/ff.ligaerent scenarios occurring. Judgement is also exercised in the assessment of to what extent the parameters for the di/ff.ligaerent scenarios, based on historical experience, are relevant for estimating future losses. Nordea adjusts its collectively calculated provisions if the historical data does not adequately reflect management's view regarding expected credit losses. Estimating post-model adjustments requires management to exercise critical judgements.\n\n## The amortisation period for capitalised software\n\nInternally developed software is capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the software. As the IT landscape develops rapidly, management exercises judgment to estimate the useful life of the software, which a/ff.ligaects the yearly amortisation charge.\n\n## E/ff.ligaectiveness testing of cash flow hedges\n\nNordea's accounting policy for cash flow hedges is described in section 10 'Hedge accounting'.\n\nOne important judgement in connection with cash flow hedge accounting is the choice of method used for e/ff.ligaectiveness testing.\n\nWhere Nordea applies cash flow hedge accounting the hedging instruments used are predominantly cross-currency interest rate swaps, which are always held at fair value. The currency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of the currency risk and the interest component as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk. The hypothetical derivative method is used when measuring the e/ff.ligaectiveness of these cash flow hedges, meaning that the change in a perfect hypothetical swap is used as proxy for the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction (the currency component). Critical judgement has to be exercised when defining the characteristics of the perfect hypothetical swap.\n\n## Actuarial calculations of pension liabilities and plan assets related to employees\n\nNordea's accounting policy for post-employment benefits is described in section 24 'Employee benefits'.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation for major pension plans is calculated by external actuaries using demographic assumptions based on the current population. As a basis for these calculations a number of actuarial and financial parameters are used.\n\nThe estimation of the discount rate is subject to uncertainty around whether corporate bond markets are deep enough and of high quality and also in connection to the extrapolation of yield curves to relevant maturities. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark the discount rate is determined with reference to covered bonds and in Finland with reference to corporate bonds. Other parameters, like assumptions about salary increases and inflation, are based on the expected long-term development of these parameters and also subject to estimation uncertainty. The main parameters used at year-end are disclosed in Note G34 'Retirement benefit obligations' together with a description of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions. The defined benefit obligation was EUR 3,801m (EUR 3,871m) at the end of the year.\n\n## Actuarial calculations of insurance contracts\n\nNordea's accounting policy for insurance contracts is described in section 19 'Liabilities to policyholders'.\n\nA valuation of insurance liabilities includes estimations and assumptions, both financial and actuarial. One of the important financial assumptions is the interest rate used for discounting future cash flows. Important actuarial assumptions are those on mortality and disability, which a/ff.ligaect the size and timing of the future cash flows. The financial and actuarial assumptions are, to a large extent, stipulated in local legislation and therefore not under Nordea's discretion. Also, assumptions about future administrative and tax expenses have an impact on the calculation of policyholder liabilities.\n\nThe insurance liability was EUR 17,438m (EUR 15,792m) at the end of the year. The sensitivity of the carrying amount to di/ff.ligaerent assumptions is disclosed in Note G29 'Liabilities to policyholders'.\n\n## Valuation of investment properties\n\nNordea's accounting policy for investment properties is described in section 18 'Investment properties'.",

        "page_content": "## G1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. As there are normally no active markets for investment properties, the fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flow models. These models are based on assumptions on future rents, vacancy levels, operating and maintenance costs, yield requirements and interest rates.\n\nThe carrying amounts of investment properties were EUR 2,366m (EUR 1,896m) at the end of the year. See Note G24 'Investment properties' for more information on amounts and parameters used in these models.\n\n## Assessment of expected lease terms and classification of leases\n\nNordea's accounting policy for leases is described in section 15 'Leasing'.\n\nFor a lessee, critical judgement has to be exercised when estimating the expected lease term by considering all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension or termination option. The expected lease term for contracts with no end date is estimated in the same way. Backstop rules on the average expected lifetime of different types of real estate contracts are used as a guidance when making the estimate for branch o/ffi.ligaces. A more detailed analysis is performed for large contracts. The head o/ffi.ligace contracts are estimated to be more long term in nature than those of the branch o/ffi.ligaces where the environment is changing at a more rapid pace. The expected lease term of the head o/ffi.ligace contracts is currently generally close to 25 years. The backstop rule of branch o/ffi.ligaces is currently limiting the expected lease term of contracts with no end date, or contracts with extension options, to 5 years. It is possible to deviate from the backstop rule if the circumstances show that Nordea is likely to stay for a longer/shorter period.\n\nFor a lessor, critical judgement has to be exercised when classifying lease contracts. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards related to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards related to ownership.\n\nThe carrying amount of right of use assets was EUR 1,331m (EUR 1,459m) at the end of the year.\n\nMore information on lease contracts can be found in Note G23 'Leasing'.\n\n## Classification of Additional Tier 1 instruments\n\nNordea has issued perpetual subordinated instruments where the interest payments to the holders are at the discretion of Nordea and non-accumulating. Some of these instruments also include a requirement for Nordea to pay interest if the instruments are no longer allowed to be included in Tier 1 capital. If there is a requirement to pay interest based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of an uncertain future event that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instrument, the instrument will be classified as a financial liability. The inclusion of the subordinated loan in Tier 1 capital is decided by the regulators and is thus beyond the control of Nordea and the holders of the instrument, and Nordea consequently classifies the instruments as financial liabilities. Instruments without such clauses are classified as equity as there is no requirement for Nordea to pay interest or principal to the holders of the instruments.\n\n## Assessing control for consolidation purposes\n\nOne decisive variable when assessing if Nordea controls another entity is whether Nordea is exposed to variability in returns from the investment. For structured entities where voting rights are not the dominant factor when determining control, critical judgement has to be exercised when defining\n\nwhen Nordea is exposed to significant variability in returns. Nordea's critical judgement is that Nordea is normally exposed to variability in returns when Nordea receives more than 30% of the return produced by the structured entity. This is only relevant for structured entities if Nordea is also the investment manager and thus has influence over the return produced by the structured entity.\n\nMoreover, judgement relating to control is whether Nordea acts as an agent or as a principal. For unit-linked and other contracts where the policyholder/depositor decides both the amount and in which assets to invest, Nordea is considered to act as an agent and thus does not have control.\n\nJudgement also has to be exercised when assessing if a holding of a significant, but less than a majority, share of voting rights constitute a so-called de facto control and to what extent potential voting rights need to be considered in the control assessment. Nordea's assessment is that Nordea does not currently control any entities where the share of voting rights is below 50%.\n\n## Valuation of deferred tax assets\n\nNordea's accounting policy for the recognition of deferred tax assets is described in section 21 'Taxes' and Note G12 'Taxes'.\n\nThe valuation of deferred tax assets is influenced by management's assessment of Nordea's future profitability and su/ffi.ligaciency of future taxable profits and future reversals of existing taxable temporary di/ff.ligaerences. These assessments are updated and reviewed at each balance sheet date, and are, if necessary, revised to reflect the current situation.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets was EUR 218m (EUR 406m) at the end of the year.\n\n## Claims in civil lawsuits and possible fines\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and disputes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts, as well as possible fines due to e.g. weak anti-money laundering processes and procedures in the past. Presently, none of the current disputes are considered likely to have any significant adverse e/ff.ligaect on Nordea or its financial position. As previously stated, Nordea expects to be fined in Denmark for weak anti-money laundering (AML) processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters. Nordea cannot exclude the possibility of fines which could impact the bank's financial performance. In addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation. See also Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management', section 6 'Compliance Risk', Note G33 'Provisions' and Note G38 'Contingent liabilities'.\n\n## Critical judgements emphasised by COVID-19\n\nNordea's assessment was that no significant critical judgements needed to be applied in the preparation of this annual report due to COVID-19, in addition to the critical judgements described above.\n\n## 5. Principles of consolidation\n\n## Consolidated entities\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company, Nordea Bank Abp, and those entities that the parent company controls. Control exists when Nordea is exposed to variability in returns from its investments in another entity and has the ability to a/ff.ligaect those returns through its power over the other entity. Control is generally achieved when the parent company owns, directly or indirectly through group undertakings, more than 50% of the voting rights. For entities where voting rights do not give control, see the section 'Structured entities' below.",

        "page_content": "## G1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\nAll group undertakings are consolidated using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the acquisition is regarded as a transaction whereby the parent company indirectly acquires the assets of the group undertaking and assumes its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The group's acquisition cost is established using a purchase price allocation analysis. In such analysis, the cost of the business combination is the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the acquirer, in exchange for the identifiable net assets acquired. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed.\n\nAs at the acquisition date Nordea recognises the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values.\n\nFor each business combination Nordea measures the noncontrolling interest in the acquired business either at fair value or at its proportionate share of the acquired identifiable net assets.\n\nWhen the aggregate of the consideration transferred in a business combination and the amount recognised for noncontrolling interest exceed the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, the excess is reported as goodwill. If the di/ff.ligaerence is negative, such di/ff.ligaerence is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nEquity and net income attributable to non-controlling interests are separately disclosed on the balance sheet, the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances between the consolidated group undertakings are eliminated.\n\nThe group undertakings are included in the consolidated accounts as from the date on which control is transferred to Nordea and are no longer consolidated as from the date on which control ceases.\n\nIn the consolidation process the reporting of the group undertakings is adjusted to ensure consistency with the IFRS principles applied by Nordea.\n\nNote G47 'Group structure' lists the major group undertakings of the Nordea Group.\n\n## Investments in associated undertakings and joint venture\n\nThe equity method of accounting is used for associated undertakings where the share of voting rights is between 20% and 50% and/or where Nordea has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nThe equity method of accounting is also used for joint ventures where Nordea has joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nInvestments within Nordea's investment activities (classified as part of Nordea's venture capital organisation) are measured at fair value in accordance with the rules set out in IAS 28 and IFRS 9. Further information on the equity method is disclosed in section 6 'Recognition of operating income and impairment'.\n\nProfits from companies accounted for under the equity method are reported post-taxes in the income statement. Consequently, the tax expense related to these profits is not included in the income tax expense for Nordea.\n\nNordea is not generally involved in any sale or contribution of assets to or from associated undertakings or joint ventures. Other transactions between Nordea and its associated undertakings or joint ventures are not eliminated.\n\nNote G20 'Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures' lists the major associated undertakings of the Nordea Group.\n\n## Structured entities\n\nA structured entity is an entity created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective where voting rights are not the dominant factor in determining control. Often legal arrangements impose strict limits on the decision-making powers of management over the ongoing activities of a structured entity. The same consolidation requirements apply to these entities, but as voting rights do not determine whether control exists, other factors are used to determine control.\n\nPower can exist due to agreements or other types of influence over a structured entity. Nordea normally has power over entities sponsored or established by Nordea. Nordea has created a number of structured entities to allow customers to invest in assets invested in by the structured entity. Some structured entities invest in tradable financial instruments, such as shares and bonds (mutual funds). Structured entities can also invest in structured credit products or acquire assets from customers of Nordea although only one such structured entity currently exists. Nordea is generally the investment manager and has sole discretion about investments and other administrative decisions and thus has power over these entities.\n\nTypically, Nordea will receive service and commission fees in connection with the establishment of the structured entity, or because it acts as an investment manager, a custodian or in some other function. Such income is normally not significant enough to expose Nordea to variability in returns and will thus not trigger consolidation. In some structured entities Nordea has also supplied substantial parts of the funding in the form of fund units, loans or credit commitments. In these structured entities Nordea is exposed to variability in returns and as the power over these entities a/ff.ligaects the return, these structured entities are consolidated. Nordea normally considers a share of more than 30% of the return produced by a structured entity to give rise to variability and thus to give control. Variability is measured as the sum of fees received and revaluation of assets held. For unit-linked and other contracts where the policyholder/depositor decides both the amount and in which assets to invest, Nordea is considered to act as an agent and does thus not have control.\n\nFurther information about consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities is disclosed in Note G46 'Interests in structured entities'.\n\n## Currency translation of foreign entities/branches\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euro (EUR). When translating the financial statements of foreign entities and branches into EUR from their functional currency, the assets and liabilities of foreign entities and branches have been translated at the closing rates, while items in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The average exchange rate is calculated based on daily exchange rates divided by the number of business days in the period. Translation di/ff.ligaerences are recognised in other comprehensive income and are accumulated in the translation reserve in equity.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of group undertakings are treated as items in the same functional currency as the cash-generating unit to which they belong and are also translated at the closing rate.\n\nAny remaining equity in foreign branches is converted at the closing rates with translation di/ff.ligaerences recognised in other comprehensive income.",

Recognition of operating income and impairment Net interest income\n\nInterest income and expense are calculated and recognised using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method or, if considered appropriate, a method that provides a reasonable approximation in line with the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method as the basis for the calculation. The e/ff.ligaective interest includes fees considered to be an integral part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of a financial instrument (generally fees received as compensation for risk). The e/ff.ligaective interest rate equals the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.\n\nInterest income and expense from financial instruments are, with the exceptions described below, classified as 'Net interest income'.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value in Markets and Life & Pension are classified as 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement. Also, interest on the net funding of operations in Markets and on assets measured at amortised cost in Life & Pension is recognised in this line item to ensure that income and expense within these operations are presented in a consistent manner.\n\nThe interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Net result from items at fair value', except for derivatives used for hedging purposes. In accounting hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability. In economic hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Other interest income' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability.\n\nThe yield on financial assets is presented in three line items in the income statement: 'Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method', 'Other interest income' and 'Negative yield on financial assets'. In the line item 'Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method', Nordea presents interest income from financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. This line item also includes the e/ff.ligaect from hedge accounting relating to these assets. All other interest income is presented in the income statement line item 'Other interest income', except negative yield on financial assets which is presented in a separate line item. Negative yield on financial liabilities is also disclosed separately in the income statement.\n\n## Net fee and commission income\n\nNordea earns commission income from di/ff.ligaerent services provided to customers. The recognition of commission income depends on the purpose for which the fees are received.\n\nThe major share of the revenues classified as 'Commission income' constitutes revenue from contracts with customers according to IFRS 15. Fee income is recognised either when or as performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nAsset management commissions are generally recognised over time as services are performed and are normally based on assets under management. These fees are recognised based on the passage of time as the amount (and the right to receive the fee) corresponds to the value received by the customer. The fees are recognised monthly when the market value of the assets under management is determined. Variable fees based on the relative performance versus a bench-\n\nmark are rare. The uncertainty relating to the variable consideration is normally resolved at least at each reporting date and the fee income can be recognised. The amount cannot generally be recognised if the outcome is still uncertain and subject to market developments.\n\nLife & Pension commission income includes fee income, referred to as expense loading, from insurance and investment contracts with policyholders. Investment contracts are contracts that do not transfer enough insurance risk to be classified as insurance contracts. The expense loading is the part of the premium income considered to be compensation for contract administration. The fee income is recognised over time when the services are performed. These contracts do generally not include any upfront fees.\n\nFees categorised as 'Deposit Products', 'Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance', 'Custody and issuer service' and 'Payments' are recognised both over time and at a point of time depending on when the performance obligations are satisfied. Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance are mainly transactional driven in relation to advising customers or executing customer transactions in securities where the services are recognised at a point of time when the services related to the transactions are completed. Payment commissions include fees for cash management and payment solutions that are recognised over time and transactionbased fees for services like domestic and foreign payments that are recognised at a point of time. Card fees are categorised as interchange fees which are recognised at a point of time when the customer uses the services, or as cardholder fees which are recognised over time or at a point of time if the fee is transaction based.\n\nLending fees that are not part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of a financial instrument are recognised at a point of time. Loan syndication fees as well as other transaction-based fees received are recognised at a point of time when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when the syndication or transaction has been performed. Fees received for bilateral transactions are generally amortised as part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of the financial instruments recognised.\n\nIncome from issued financial guarantees, and expenses for bought financial guarantees, are amortised over the duration of the instruments and classified as 'Fee and commission income' and 'Fee and commission expense', respectively. Other fee income is generally transaction based.\n\nFor transactional services performed at a point of time, payments are generally made instantly when the services are performed. For services performed over time the period of service is normally short. Examples of such services are monthly payment services and monthly or quarterly asset management services. For the services performed over time, the right to payment generally arises at the end of the period of service when the performance obligations are completed and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of the consideration will occur. However, for some services with fixed monthly fees, the right to payment arises in advance. Account receivables are recognised as 'Other assets' while unbilled receivables for satisfied performance obligations and contract assets are recognised as 'Prepaid expenses and accrued income'. Short-term advances received where the performance obligations have not yet been satisfied are recognised as 'Accrued expenses and prepaid income'.\n\nCommission expenses are normally transaction based and recognised in the period when the services are received.\n\nInitial contract costs for obtaining contracts are recognised as an asset and amortised if the costs are expected to be recovered.",

This line item also includes realised results from disposals as well as the running property yield stemming from the holding of investment properties.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value in Markets and Life & Pension are classified as 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement. Furthermore, the interest component of derivatives including changes in accrued interest, is classified as 'Net result from items at fair value', except for derivatives used for hedging purposes, including economic hedges where such components are classified in the same income statement line as the interest from the hedged asset and liability.  Also, interest on the net funding of operations in Markets and on assets measured at amortised cost in Life & Pension is recognised in this line to ensure that income and expense within these operations are presented in a consistent manner. Also, the ine/ff.ligaective portion of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges as well as recycled gains and losses on financial instruments classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' is recognised in 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nThis item also includes realised gains and losses from financial instruments measured at amortised cost such as interest compensation received and realised gains/losses on buy-backs of issued own debt.\n\n'Net result from items at fair value' also includes fair value changes of hedged assets and liabilities at amortised cost in hedges of interest rate risk.\n\n'Net result from items at fair value' also includes losses from counterparty risk on instruments classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss', except for loans in 'hold' portfolios mandatorily held at fair value (SPPI fails) which are presented in the line item 'Net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value' (see below).  Impairment losses on instruments within other categories are recognised in the item 'Net loan losses' (see also the sub-section 'Net loan losses' below).\n\nDividends received are recognised in the income statement as 'Net result from items at fair value' and classified as 'Equity-related instruments' in the note. Income is recognised in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.\n\nThe income recognition and descriptions of the line items relating to life insurance are described in section 7 'Income recognition life insurance' below.\n\n## Profit from companies accounted for under the equity method\n\nProfit from companies accounted for under the equity method is defined as the post-acquisition change in Nordea's share\n\nof net assets in associated undertakings and joint ventures. Nordea's share of items accounted for in other comprehensive income in associated undertakings and joint ventures is accounted for in other comprehensive income in Nordea. Profit from companies accounted for under the equity method is, as stated in section 5 'Principles of consolidation', reported post taxes in the income statement. Consequently, the tax expense related to this profit is excluded from the income tax expense for Nordea.\n\nFair value is, at acquisition, allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of associated undertakings and joint ventures. Any di/ff.ligaerence between Nordea's share of the fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets and the purchase price is goodwill or negative goodwill. Goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the associated undertakings and joint ventures. Subsequently, the investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures increase/decrease with Nordea's share of the post-acquisition change in the net assets of the associated undertakings and joint ventures and decrease through dividends received and impairment. An impairment charge can be reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nThe change in Nordea's share of the net assets is generally based on monthly reporting from the associated undertakings and joint ventures. For some associated undertakings and joint ventures not individually significant the change in Nordea's share of the net assets is based on the external reporting of the associated undertakings and joint ventures and a/ff.ligaects the financial statements of Nordea in the period in which the information is available. The reporting from the associated undertakings and joint ventures is, if applicable, adjusted to comply with Nordea's accounting policies.\n\nAlso, impairment of investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures is classified as 'Profit from associated undertakings and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method' in the income statement. The policies covering impairment of financial assets classified into the category 'Amortised cost' are disclosed in section 13 'Financial instruments' and section 14 'Loans to the public/credit institutions'.\n\nIf observable indicators (loss events) indicate that an associated undertaking or a joint ventures is impaired, an impairment test is performed to assess whether there is objective evidence of impairment. The carrying amount of the investment in the associated undertaking or joint venture is compared with the recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less cost to sell) and the carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount if required.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\n## Other operating income and other expenses\n\nNet gains from divestment of shares in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures and net gains from the sale of tangible assets as well as other operating income, not related to any other income line, are generally recognised when it is probable that the benefits associated with the transaction will flow to Nordea and if the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer (generally when the transaction is finalised).\n\nResolution fees are presented as 'Other expenses' in the income statement.",

The loans are classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' and presented in the item 'Loans to the public' on the balance sheet. Fair value adjustments are largely driven by changes in credit risk.\n\nLosses from counterparty risk on other instruments classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' are presented as 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nImpairment losses on instruments within other categories than the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' are recognised in the item 'Net loan losses' (see also the sub-section 'Net loan losses' below).\n\n## Net loan losses\n\nImpairment losses on financial assets classified into the categories 'Amortised cost' and 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' (see section 13 'Financial instruments'), in the items 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions', 'Loans to the public' and 'Interest-bearing securities' on the balance sheet, are reported as 'Net loan losses' together with losses from financial guarantees. Losses are reported net of any collateral and other credit enhancements. Nordea's accounting policies for the calculation of impairment losses on loans can be found in section 14 'Loans to the public/credit institutions'.\n\nCounterparty losses on instruments classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss', including credit derivatives but excluding loans held at fair value as described above, are reported under 'Net result from items at fair value' or, if related to loans in 'hold' portfolios mandatorily held at fair value (SPPI fails), in the line item 'Net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value', see above.\n\n## 7. Income recognition life insurance\n\nPremiums received, and repayments to policyholders, related to the savings part of life insurance contracts are reported as increases or decreases of liabilities to policyholders. See further information in section 19 'Liabilities to policyholders'.\n\nThe total income from life insurance mainly consists of the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 cost result\n- \u00b7 insurance risk result\n- \u00b7 risk and performance margin\n- \u00b7 investment return on additional capital in life insurance.\n\nThe results from these components are, except for the cost result and the risk and performance margin relating to unitlinked and investment contracts, included in 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nThe cost result is the result of expense loading from policyholders and is included in the item 'Fee and commission income' together with the risk and performance margin relating to unit-linked and investment contracts. The related expenses are included in the items 'Fee and commission expense' and 'Operating expenses'. The policyholders' part of a positive or negative cost result (profit sharing) is included in the 'Change in technical provisions' row of Note G6 'Total net result from items at fair value'.\n\nThe insurance risk result consists of income from individual risk products and from unbundled life insurance contracts as well as health and personal accident insurance. The risk pre-\n\nmiums are amortised over the coverage period as the provisions are reduced when the insurance risk is released. A large part of the unbundled risk result from traditional life insurance is subject to profit sharing, which means that the policyholders receive part of the net income or net deficit. Risk income and risk expenses are presented gross in the 'Insurance risk income' and 'Insurance risk expense' row of Note G6 'Total net result from items at fair value'. The policyholders' part of the result is included in the 'Change in technical provisions' row of the note.\n\nGains and losses derived from investments at Life & Pension are split between the relevant rows of Note G6 'Total net result from items at fair value' as are any other investments at Nordea. The rows include investment returns on assets held to cover liabilities to policyholders and return on the additional capital allocated to Life & Pension (shareholders' capital in Life & Pension).\n\nThe row 'Change in technical provisions' in the table 'Breakdown of Nordea Life & Pension' in Note G6 'Total net result from items at fair value' includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Investment returns on assets held to cover liabilities to policyholders (including liabilities from traditional life insurance, unit-linked insurance and investment contracts), transferred individually to policyholders' accounts according to their contracts.\n- \u00b7 Additional bonuses (discretionary participation feature) to policyholders concerning traditional life insurance contracts or any other transfers to the policyholders to cover a periodical deficit between the investment result and any agreed minimum benefit to policyholders.\n- \u00b7 The risk and performance margin regarding traditional life insurance products according to local allocation rules in each Life & Pension unit and according to contracts with policyholders. The recognition of risk and performance margins in the income statement is mainly conditional on a positive result for traditional life insurance contracts. Risk and performance margins not possible to recognise in the current period due to poor investment results can, in some countries, partly or wholly be deferred to years with higher returns.\n- \u00b7 The policyholders' part of the cost- and risk results regarding traditional life insurance contracts or unit-linked contracts.\n\nThe 'Change in collective bonus potential' row of Note G6 'Total net result from items at fair value' relates only to traditional life insurance contracts. The row includes policyholders' share of investment returns not yet individualised. The row also includes additional bonus (discretionary participation feature) and amounts needed to cover a periodical deficit between the investment result and any minimum benefits to the policyholders.\n\n## 8. Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments on the balance sheet\n\nDerivative instruments, quoted securities and foreign exchange spot transactions are recognised on and derecognised from (and an asset or a liability is recognised as 'Other assets' or 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet between the trade date and the settlement date) the balance sheet on the trade date. Other financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet on the settlement date.\n\nFinancial assets, other than those for which trade date accounting is applied, are derecognised from the balance sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred to another party. The rights to the cash flows normally expire or are transferred",

Accounting policies, cont.\n\nwhen the counterparty has performed by e.g. repaying a loan to Nordea, i.e. on the settlement date.\n\nLoans and other financial assets where cash flows are modified, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised, and a new loan recognised, if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the old loan. This is normally the case if the present value of the cash flows for the new loan discounted by the original interest rate di/ff.ligaers by more than 10% from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows for the old loan. The same principles apply to financial liabilities. The terms and conditions are also considered to be significantly di/ff.ligaerent for financial assets where the modified cash flows are SPPI, but the original cash flows were not SPPI and vice versa.\n\nIn some cases, Nordea enters into transactions where it transfers assets that are recognised on the balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. If all or substantially all risks and rewards are retained, the transferred assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet. If Nordea's counterparty can sell or repledge the transferred assets, the assets are reclassified to the item 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral' on the balance sheet. Transfers of assets with retention of all or substantially all risks and rewards include e.g. securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised from the balance sheet when the liability is extinguished. Normally this occurs when Nordea performs, for example when Nordea returns a deposit to the counterparty, i.e. on the settlement date. Financial liabilities under trade date accounting are generally derecognised and a liability is recognised as 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet on the trade date.\n\nFor further information, see sections 'Securities borrowing and lending agreements' and 'Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements' within section 13 'Financial instruments' as well as Note G43 'Transferred assets and obtained collateral'.\n\n## 9. Translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies\n\nThe functional currency of each entity (subsidiary or branch) is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Foreign currency is defined as any currency other than the functional currency of the entity. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\nExchange di/ff.ligaerences arising on the settlement of transactions at rates di/ff.ligaerent from those on the date of the transactions, and unrealised translation di/ff.ligaerences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nExchange di/ff.ligaerences arising on internal long-term loans to foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the future (i.e., in substance, part of Nordea's net investment in that foreign operation) are recognised in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.\n\n## 10. Hedge accounting\n\nAs part of Nordea's risk management policy, Nordea has identified a series of risk categories with corresponding hedging strategies using derivative instruments, as set out in section 4/uni00A0'Market risk' in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note G19 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\nWhen a hedging relationship meets the specified hedge accounting criteria set out in IAS 39, Nordea applies one of three types of hedge accounting:\n\n- \u00b7 fair value hedge accounting\n- \u00b7 cash flow hedge accounting\n- \u00b7 hedges of net investments.\n\nNordea has elected, as a policy choice permitted under IFRS 9, to continue to apply hedge accounting in accordance with the carve-out version of IAS 39.\n\nUnder the EU carve-out version of IAS 39, fair value macro hedge accounting may for instance, in comparison with IAS 39 as issued by the IASB, be applied to on-demand (core) deposits, and hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness in a hedge of assets with prepayment options is only recognised when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows falls below the designated bottom layer.\n\nAt inception, Nordea formally documents how the hedging relationship meets the hedge accounting criteria, including the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the nature of the risk, the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and the method that will be used to assess the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the hedging relationship on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe application of hedge accounting requires the hedge to be highly e/ff.ligaective. A hedge is regarded as highly e/ff.ligaective if at inception and throughout its life it can be expected that changes in the fair value of the hedged item, as regards the hedged risk, can be essentially o/ff.ligaset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The result should be within a range of 80-125%.\n\nTransactions that are entered into in accordance with Nordea's hedging objectives but do not qualify for hedge accounting, are economic hedge relationships.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nFair value hedge accounting is applied when derivatives are hedging changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability attributable to a specific risk in accordance with Nordea's risk management policies set out in section 4 'Market risk' in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note G19 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'. The risk of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities in Nordea's financial statements originates mainly from loans, securities and deposits with a fixed interest rate, causing interest rate risk. Changes in the fair value of derivatives as well as changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged are recognised separately in the income statement in the line item 'Net result from items at the fair value'. Given that the hedge is e/ff.ligaective, the change in the fair value of the hedged item will be o/ff.ligaset by the change in fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged with the derivative instrument are reflected in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item, which is also recognised in the income statement. The fair value changes of the hedged items held at amortised cost in hedges of interest rate risks are reported separately in the balance sheet item 'Fair value changes of hedged items in hedges of interest rate risk'.\n\nFair value hedge accounting at Nordea is performed both at a micro level and on a portfolio basis. Any ine/ff.ligaectiveness is recognised in the income statement under the item 'Net result from items at fair value'.",

        "page_content": "## G1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\n## Hedged items\n\nA hedged item in a fair value hedge can be a recognised single asset or liability, an unrecognised firm commitment or a portion thereof. The hedged item can also be a group of assets, liabilities or firm commitments with similar risk characteristics. Hedged items at Nordea consist of both individual assets or liabilities and portfolios of assets and/or liabilities.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\nThe hedging instruments used at Nordea are predominantly interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, which are always held at fair value.\n\n## Hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness\n\nWhen assessing hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness retrospectively, Nordea measures the fair value of a hedging instrument and compares the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to the change in the fair value of the hedged item. The e/ff.ligaectiveness measurement is made on a cumulative basis.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued. For fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is measured at fair value through profit and loss and the change in the fair value of the hedged item, up to the point when the hedge relationship is terminated, is amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the hedged item.\n\nHedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness can arise from:\n\n- \u00b7 di/ff.ligaerences in timing of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 di/ff.ligaerent interest rate curves applied to discount the hedged items and hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 the e/ff.ligaect of changes in Nordea's or a counterparty's credit risk on the fair value of the hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 disparity between expected and actual prepayments of the loan portfolio.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nIn accordance with Nordea's risk management policies set out in section 4 'Market risk' in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note G19 'Derivatives and hedge accounting', cash flow hedge accounting is applied when hedging the exposure to variability in future interest payments on instruments with variable interest rates as well as currency exposures. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, determined to be an e/ff.ligaective hedge, is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. The ine/ff.ligaective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recycled to the item 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement.\n\nGains or losses on hedging instruments recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity through other comprehensive income are recycled and recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item a/ff.ligaects profit or loss, normally in the period that interest income or interest expense is recognised.\n\n## Hedged items\n\nA hedged item in a cash flow hedge can be highly probable floating interest rate cash flows from recognised assets or liabilities or from future assets or liabilities. Nordea uses cash flow hedges when hedging currency risk on future payments of interest and principal (both from issued debt in foreign currency and/or intra-group lending) and when hedging interest rate risk on lending with floating interest rates.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\nThe hedging instruments used at Nordea are predominantly cross-currency interest rate swaps, which are always held at fair value, where the currency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of currency risk and the interest component as a fair value hedge of interest rate risk. When hedging the interest rate risk on lending with floating interest rates, Nordea uses interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments, which are always held at fair value.\n\n## Hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness\n\nThe hypothetical derivative method is used when measuring the e/ff.ligaectiveness retrospectively of cash flow hedges, meaning that the change in a perfect hypothetical swap is used as proxy for the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows from the hedged transaction (the currency component).\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued. Changes in the unrealised value of the hedging instrument will prospectively from the last time it was proven e/ff.ligaective be accounted for in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity through other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was e/ff.ligaective is reclassified from equity to 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement if the expected transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nIf the expected transaction is no longer highly probable, but is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was e/ff.ligaective will remain in other comprehensive income until the transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.\n\nThe possible sources of ine/ff.ligaectiveness for cash flow hedges are generally the same as for those for fair value hedges described above. However, for cash flow hedges, prepayment risk is less relevant, and the causes of hedging ine/ff.ligaectiveness arise from the changes in the timing and the amount of forecast future cash flows.\n\n## Hedges of net investments\n\nIn accordance with Nordea's risk management policies set out in section 4 'Market risk' in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note G19 'Derivatives and hedge accounting', Nordea hedges its foreign currency translation risk. Translation risk is defined as the risk of loss on investments in foreign operations which have a functional currency di/ff.ligaerent from that of the Group reporting currency (EUR). The hedging instruments used by Nordea are foreign exchange forwards where only the spot component is designated in the hedging relationship.\n\nTranslation di/ff.ligaerences in financial instruments that are designated as hedging instruments in a hedge of a net investment in a group undertaking are recognised in other comprehensive income, to the extent that the hedge is e/ff.ligaective. This is to o/ff.ligaset the translation di/ff.ligaerences a/ff.ligaecting other comprehensive income when consolidating the group undertaking into Nordea, including the revaluation of any extended net investments. Hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness can arise to the extent that the hedging instruments exceed in nominal terms the risk exposure from foreign operations. Any ine/ff.ligaectiveness is recognised in the income statement in the item 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nSee also section 9 'Translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies'.",

Determination of fair value of financial instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that at the measurement date would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe existence of published price quotations in an active market is the best evidence of fair value and when they exist they are used to measure financial assets and financial liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with su/ffi.ligacient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The absolute level of liquidity and volume required for a market to be considered active varies depending on the class of instruments. For some classes low price volatility is seen, also for those instruments within the class where the trade frequency is high. For instruments in such a class the liquidity requirements are lower and, correspondingly, the age limit for the prices used to establish fair value is higher.\n\nThe trade frequency and volume are monitored regularly in order to assess if markets are active or not active. Nordea predominantly uses published price quotations to establish fair value for items disclosed under the following balance sheet items:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest-bearing securities\n- \u00b7 Shares (listed)\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (listed)\n- \u00b7 Debt securities in issue (mortgage bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab).\n\nIf quoted prices for a financial instrument fail to represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions or if quoted prices are not available, fair value is established by using an appropriate valuation technique. The adequacy of the valuation technique, including an assessment of whether to use quoted prices or theoretical prices, is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nValuation techniques can range from a simple discounted cash flow analysis to complex option pricing models. Valuation models are designed to apply observable market prices and rates as input whenever possible but can also make use of unobservable model parameters. The adequacy of the valuation model is assessed by measuring its ability to match market prices. This is done by comparing calculated prices with relevant benchmark data, e.g. quoted prices from exchanges, the counterparty's valuations, price data from consensus services etc.\n\nNordea predominantly uses valuation techniques to establish fair value for items disclosed under the following balance sheet items:\n\n- \u00b7 Loans to the public (mortgage loans in Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab)\n- \u00b7 Interest-bearing securities (when quoted prices in an active market are not available)\n- \u00b7 Shares (when quoted prices in an active market are not available)\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (OTC derivatives).\n\nFor financial instruments whose fair value is estimated by a valuation technique, it is investigated whether the variables used in the valuation model are predominantly based on data from observable markets. Nordea considers data from observable markets to be data that can be collected from generally available external sources and which is deemed to represent realistic market prices. If unobservable data has a significant impact on the valuation, the instrument cannot be recognised initially at the fair value estimated by the valuation technique and any upfront gains are thereby deferred and amortised through the income statement over the contractual life of the instrument. The deferred upfront gains are\n\nsubsequently released to income if the unobservable data becomes observable.\n\nNote G41 'Assets and liabilities at fair value' provides a breakdown of the fair values of financial instruments measured on the basis of:\n\n- \u00b7 quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (Level 1),\n- \u00b7 a valuation technique using observable data (Level 2)\n- \u00b7 a valuation technique using unobservable data (Level 3).\n\nThe valuation models applied by Nordea are consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments and incorporate the factors that market participants consider when setting a price.\n\nNew valuation models are subject to approval by the Model Risk Committee and all models are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nFor further information, see Note G41 'Assets and liabilities at fair value'.\n\n## 12. Cash and balances with central banks\n\nCash comprises legal tender and bank notes in foreign currencies. Balances with central banks consist of deposits in accounts with central banks and postal giro systems under government authority when the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- \u00b7 The central bank or the postal giro system is domiciled in the country where the institutions are established.\n- \u00b7 The balance is readily available at any time.\n\n## 13. Financial instruments\n\n## Classification of financial instruments\n\nEach financial instrument has been classified into one of the following categories:\n\nFinancial assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: - Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss\n- - Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: - Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss\n- -  Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option).\n\nThe classification of a financial asset is dependent on the business model for the portfolio in which the instrument is included and on whether the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI).\n\nFinancial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) are measured at fair value through profit and loss. All other assets are classified based on the business model. Instruments included in a portfolio with a business model where the intention is to keep the instruments and collect contractual cash flows are measured at amortised cost. Instruments included in a business model where the intention is both to keep the instruments to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets included in any other business model are measured at fair value through profit and loss.",

        "page_content": "## G1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\nIn order to determine the business model, Nordea has divided its financial assets into portfolios and/or sub-portfolios based on how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. When determining the right level for the portfolios, Nordea has taken the current business area structure into account. When determining the business model for each portfolio Nordea has analysed the objective for the financial assets as well as, for instance, past sales behaviour and management compensation.\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. The classification of financial instruments into different categories forms the basis for how each instrument is subsequently measured on the balance sheet and how changes in its value are recognised. In the table in Note G40 'Classification of financial instruments', the classification of the financial instruments on Nordea's balance sheet into the di/ff.ligaerent categories under IFRS 9 is presented.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the instruments within this category are measured at amortised cost. In an amortised cost measurement, the di/ff.ligaerence between acquisition cost and redemption value is amortised in the income statement over the remaining term using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method. Amortised cost is defined as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method of any di/ff.ligaerence between that initial amount and the maturity amount and for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance. For more information about the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method see section 6, 'Net interest income'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see section 14 below.\n\nInterest on assets and liabilities classified at amortised cost is recognised in the items 'Interest income' and 'Interest expense' in the income statement.\n\nThis category mainly consists of all loans and deposits, except for reverse repurchase/repurchase agreements and securities borrowing/lending agreements in Markets and mortgage loans in Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab. This category also includes interest bearing securities mainly related to a portfolio of interest-bearing securities in Life & Pension in Norway, subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue, except for bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab and structured bonds issued by Markets.\n\n## Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs. All changes in fair value are recognised directly in the income statement in the item 'Net result from items at fair value'. However, fair value adjustments of the margin component on loans in 'hold' portfolios mandatorily held at fair value (SPPI fails) are recognised in the income statement on the line 'Net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value'.\n\nThe category consists of two sub-categories: 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss' and 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)'.\n\nThe sub-category 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss' mainly contains all assets in Markets, trading liabilities in Markets, interest-bearing securities included in part of the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer, derivative instruments,\n\nshares, mortgage loans in the Danish subsidiary Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab and financial assets under 'Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts'. Deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts are contracts with customers and policyholders where the total risk is born by the policyholders. The deposits are invested in di/ff.ligaerent types of financial assets on behalf of customers and policyholders.\n\nThe major parts of the financial assets/liabilities classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss' are bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab and assets and liabilities in Life & Pension.\n\nLiabilities in Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab are classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss' to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch. When Nordea grants mortgage loans to customers in accordance with Danish mortgage legislation Nordea at the same time issues bonds with matching terms, so-called 'match funding'. The customers can repay the loans either through repayment of the principal or by purchasing the issued bonds and returning them to Nordea settling the loan. The bonds play an important part in the Danish money market and Nordea consequently buys and sells own bonds in the market. The loans are measured at fair value through profit and loss because they fail the SPPI (Solely Payments of Principal and Interest) criteria, and if the bonds were measured at amortised cost, this would give rise to an accounting mismatch. To avoid such an accounting mismatch Nordea measures the bonds at fair value with all changes in fair value including changes in credit risk recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAll assets in Life & Pension held under investment contracts are classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss' to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch with the liabilities to the policyholders that are measured at fair value. The investment contracts (unit-linked) classified as 'Liabilities to policyholders' on the balance sheet are managed at fair value and consequently classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss'. Changes in own credit risk are recognised in profit and loss as recognising such changes in other comprehensive income would create an accounting mismatch. Assets held under insurance contracts (defined in section 19 'Liabilities to policyholders'), except for a portfolio of interest-bearing securities in Norway, are classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss' to reduce an accounting mismatch with the liabilities to policyholders that are generally measured at current value.\n\nAlso, assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts that are not mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss are classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss' to avoid an accounting mismatch with the related deposits. Deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts are managed at fair value and consequently also classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss'. The value of these deposits is directly linked to assets in the contacts and changes in own credit risk consequently have no impact on these contracts.\n\nNordea also applies the fair value option on structured bonds issued by Markets as these instruments include embedded derivatives not closely related to the host contract. The change in fair value of these issued structured bonds is recognised in profit and loss except for the changes in credit risk that are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value through profit and loss in Markets and Life & Pension are classified as 'Net result from items at fair value'.",

Accounting policies, cont.\n\n## Financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. This category mainly consists of the interest-bearing securities included in part of the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer. Changes in fair value, except for interest, foreign exchange e/ff.ligaects and impairment losses, are recognised in the fair value reserve in equity through other comprehensive income. Interest is recognised in the item 'Interest income', foreign exchange e/ff.ligaects in 'Net result from items at fair value' and impairment losses in the item 'Net loan losses' in the income statement. When an instrument is disposed of, the fair value changes previously accumulated in the fair value reserve in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the item 'Net result from items at fair value'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see section 14 below.\n\n## Hybrid (combined) financial instruments\n\nHybrid (combined) financial instruments are contracts containing a host contract and an embedded derivative instrument. Such combinations arise predominantly from the issuance of structured debt instruments, such as issued indexlinked bonds and loans with embedded collars and caps.\n\nFor structured bonds issued by Markets, Nordea applies the fair value option, and the entire combined instrument, the host contract together with the embedded derivative, is measured at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the item 'Net result from items at fair value' and presented as 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet.\n\n## Securities borrowing and lending agreements\n\nGenerally, securities borrowing and securities lending transactions are entered into on a collateralised basis. Unless the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, the securities are not recognised on or derecognised from the balance sheet. In cases where the counterparty is entitled to resell or repledge the securities, the securities are reclassified to the balance sheet item 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral'.\n\nSecurities in securities lending transactions are also disclosed in the item 'Assets pledged as security for own liabilities'.\n\nCash collateral advanced (securities borrowing) to counterparties is recognised on the balance sheet as 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions' or 'Loans to the public'. Cash collateral received (securities lending) from counterparties is recognised on the balance sheet as 'Deposits by credit institutions' or 'Deposits and borrowings from the public'.\n\n## Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements\n\nSecurities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities received under reverse repurchase agreements are not derecognised from or recognised on the balance sheet. In cases where the counterparty has the right to resell or repledge the securities, the securities are reclassified to the balance sheet line 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral'.\n\nSecurities delivered under repurchase agreements are also disclosed in the item 'Assets pledged as security for own liabilities'.\n\nCash received under repurchase agreements is recognised on the balance sheet as 'Deposits by credit institutions' or 'Deposits and borrowings from the public'. Cash delivered under reverse repurchase agreements is recognised on the\n\nbalance sheet as 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions' or 'Loans to the public'.\n\nA sale of a security not owned by Nordea is defined as a short sale and triggers the recognition of a trading liability ('Sold, not held, securities') presented as 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. The short sale is generally covered through a Securities Financing Transaction (SFT), normally a reverse repurchase agreement or other forms of securities borrowing agreements.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAll derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. Derivatives with a positive fair value, including any accrued interest, are recognised as assets in the item 'Derivatives' on the asset side. Derivatives with a negative fair value, including any accrued interest, are recognised as liabilities in the item 'Derivatives' on the liability side.\n\nRealised and unrealised gains and losses from derivatives are recognised in the income statement in the item 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\n## O/ff.ligasetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nNordea o/ff.ligasets financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet if there is a legal right to o/ff.ligaset, in the ordinary course of business and in case of default, bankruptcy and insolvency of Nordea and the counterparties, and if the intent is to settle the items net or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nExchanged-traded derivatives are generally accounted for as settled on a daily basis when cash is paid or received, and the instrument is reset to market terms. Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities against central counterparty clearing houses are o/ff.ligaset on the balance sheet if the transaction currency and the central counterparty are the same. Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities related to bilateral OTC derivative transactions are not o/ff.ligaset on the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase transaction with CCP are o/ff.ligaset on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same central counterparty, are settled in the same currency and have the same maturity date. Loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions that are made in accordance with the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) are o/ff.ligaset on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same counterparty, are settled in the same currency, have the same maturity date and are settled through the same settlement institution.\n\n## Issued debt and equity instruments\n\nA financial instrument issued by Nordea is either classified as a financial liability or equity. Issued financial instruments are classified as a financial liability if the contractual arrangement results in Nordea having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments to the holder of the instrument. If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and classified as equity, net of transaction costs. Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.\n\n## 14. Loans to the public/credit institutions Scope\n\nFinancial instruments classified as 'Amortised cost' or 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are subject to impairment testing due to credit risk. This includes assets recognised on the balance sheet as 'Loans to central banks',",

        "page_content": "## G1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\nLoans to credit institutions', 'Loans to the public' and 'Interest-bearing securities'. Loans to the public includes finance leases, which also are subject to impairment testing. These balance sheet lines also include assets classified as Fair value through profit or loss, which are not subject to impairment testing. See section 13 above and Note G40 'Classification of financial instruments'.\n\nO/ff.liga-balance sheet commitments, contingent liabilities and loan commitments are also subject to impairment testing.\n\n## Recognition and presentation\n\nAmortised cost assets are recognised gross with an o/ff.ligasetting allowance for the expected credit losses if the loss is not regarded as final. The allowance account is disclosed net on the face of the balance sheet, but the allowance account is disclosed separately in the notes. Changes in the allowance account are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nIf the impairment loss is regarded as final, it is reported as a realised loss and the carrying amount of the loan and the related allowance for impairment loss are derecognised. An impairment loss is regarded as final when the obligor has filed for bankruptcy and the administrator has declared the economic outcome of the bankruptcy procedure, or when Nordea waives its claims either through a legally based or voluntary reconstruction, or when Nordea, for other reasons, deems it unlikely that the claim will be recovered. See also section 'Write-o/ff.ligas' below.\n\nProvisions for o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures are classified as 'Provisions' on the balance sheet, with changes in provisions classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nAssets classified as 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet. Impairment losses calculated in accordance with IFRS 9 are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Net loan losses'. Any fair value adjustments are recognised in 'Other comprehensive income'.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nNordea classifies all exposures into stages on an individual basis. Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 (impaired loans) includes defaulted assets. Nordea monitors whether there are indicators of exposures being credit impaired (stage 3) by identifying events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows (loss event). Nordea applies the same definition of default as the Capital Requirements Regulation. More information on the identification of loss events can be found in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'. Exposures without individually calculated allowances will be covered by the model-based impairment calculation.\n\nFor significant exposures where a credit event has been identified, the exposure is tested for impairment on an individual basis. If the exposure is found impaired, an individual provision is recognised. The carrying amount of the exposure is compared with the sum of the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the carrying amount is higher, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss. The expected cash flows are discounted with the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate and include the fair value of the collateral and other credit enhancements. The estimate is based on three di/ff.ligaerent forward-looking scenarios that are probability weighted to derive the net present value.\n\nFor insignificant exposures that have been individually identified as credit impaired, the impairment loss is measured using the model described below but based on the fact that the exposures are already in default.\n\n## Model-based allowance calculation\n\nFor exposures not impaired on an individual basis, a statistical model is used for calculating impairment losses. The provisions are calculated as the exposure at default times the probability of default (PD) times the loss given default. For assets in stage 1 this calculation is only based on the coming 12 months, while for assets in stages 2 and 3 it is based on the expected lifetime of the asset.\n\nThe provisions for exposures for which there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are based on the 12-month expected loss (stage 1). Provisions for exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but that are not credit impaired, are based on the lifetime expected losses (stage 2). This is also the case for the insignificant credit impaired exposures in stage 3.\n\nNordea uses two di/ff.ligaerent models to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. For assets held at transition on 1 January 2018, the change in internal rating and scoring data is used to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. Internal rating/scoring information is used to assess the risk of the customers and a deterioration in rating/scoring indicates an increase in the credit risk of the customer. Nordea has concluded that it is not possible to calculate the lifetime (PD) at origination without the use of hindsight for assets already recognised on the balance sheet at transition. Changes to the lifetime PD are used as the trigger for assets recognised after transition.\n\nFor assets evaluated based on lifetime PD, Nordea uses a mix of absolute and relative changes in PD as the transfer criterion.\n\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 1%: Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 45bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or\n- equal to 1%: Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 300bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Nonretail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 20bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 400bp are transferred to stage 2.\n\nFor assets for which rating and scoring models are used, the change in rating/scoring notches is calibrated to match the significant increase in credit risk based on lifetime PD. In addition, customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to stage 2, unless already identified as credit impaired (stage 3). Exposures with forbearance measures will stay in stage 2 for a probation period of 24 months from when the measures were introduced. Once transferred back to stage 1, after the probation period, the exposures are treated as any other stage 1 exposure when assessing significant increase in credit risk. Exposures more than 90 days past due will normally be classified as stage 3, but this classification will be rebutted if there is evidence that the customer is not in default. Such exposures will be classified as stage 2. Rated exposures classified as 'high risk', i.e. with a rating grade of 2 or below will also be transferred to stage 2.",

        "page_content": "## G1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\nNordea does not use the 'low credit risk exemption' in its banking operations but uses it for a minor portfolio of interestbearing securities in its insurance operations.\n\nWhen calculating provisions, including the staging assessment, the calculation is based on probability-weighted forward-looking information. Nordea applies three macroeconomic scenarios to address the non-linearity in expected credit losses. The di/ff.ligaerent scenarios are used to adjust the relevant parameters for calculating expected losses and a probability-weighted average of the expected losses under each scenario is recognised as provisions. The model is based on data collected before the reporting date, requiring Nordea to identify events that should a/ff.ligaect the provisions after the data is sourced to the model calculation. Management evaluates these events and adjusts the provisions if deemed necessary.\n\n## Write-o/ff.ligas\n\nA write-o/ff.liga is a derecognition of a loan or receivable from the balance sheet and a final realisation of a credit loss provision. When assets are considered as uncollectable, they should be written o/ff.liga as soon as possible, regardless of whether the legal claim remains or not. A write-o/ff.liga can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded in full. Although an uncollectable asset is removed or written o/ff.liga from the balance sheet, the customer remains legally obligated to pay the outstanding debt. When assessing the recoverability of non-performing loans and determining if write-o/ff.ligas are required, exposures with the following characteristics are in particular focus (the list is not exhaustive):\n\n- \u00b7 Exposures past due more than 90 days. If, following this assessment, an exposure or part of an exposure is deemed as unrecoverable, it is written o/ff.liga.\n- \u00b7 Exposures under insolvency procedure where the collateralisation of the exposure is low.\n- \u00b7 Exposures where legal expenses are expected to absorb the proceeds from the bankruptcy procedure and estimated recoveries are therefore expected to be low.\n- \u00b7 A partial write-o/ff.liga may be warranted where there is reasonable financial evidence to demonstrate an inability of the borrower to repay the full amount, i.e. a significant level of debt which cannot be reasonably demonstrated to be recoverable following forbearance treatment and/or the execution of collateral.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring cases.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate used to measure impairment is the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate for loans attached to an individual customer or, if applicable, to a group of loans. If considered appropriate, the discount rate can be based on a method that results in an impairment that is a reasonable approximation of using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method as basis for the calculation.\n\n## Restructured loans and modifications\n\nIn this context a restructured loan is defined as a loan where Nordea has granted concessions to the obligor due to their financial di/ffi.ligaculties and where this concession has resulted in an impairment loss for Nordea. After a reconstruction the loan is normally regarded as not impaired if it performs according to the new conditions. In the event of a recovery, the payment is reported as a recovery of loan losses.\n\nModifications of the contractual cash flows for loans to customers in financial di/ffi.ligaculties (forbearance) reduce the gross carrying amount of the loan. Normally this reduction is less than the existing provision and no loss is recognised in\n\nthe income statement due to modifications. If significant, the gross amounts (loan and allowance) are reduced.\n\n## Assets taken over for protection of claims\n\nIn a financial reconstruction the creditor may concede loans to the obligor and in exchange for this concession acquires an asset pledged for the conceded loans, shares issued by the obligor or other assets. Assets taken over for protection of claims are reported on the same balance sheet line as similar assets already held by Nordea. For example, a property taken over, not held for Nordea's own use, is reported together with other investment properties.\n\nAt initial recognition, all assets taken over for protection of claims are recognised at fair value and the possible di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount of the loan and the fair value of the assets taken over is recognised as 'Net loan losses'. The fair value of the asset on the date of recognition becomes its cost or amortised cost value, as applicable. In subsequent periods, assets taken over for protection of claims are valued in accordance with the valuation principles for the appropriate type of asset. Investment properties are then measured at fair value. Financial assets that are foreclosed are generally classified into the category 'Fair value through profit or loss' and measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nAny change in value, after the initial recognition of the asset taken over, is presented in the income statement in line with the Group's presentation policies for the appropriate asset. The item 'Net loan losses' in the income statement is, after the initial recognition of the asset taken over, consequently not a/ff.ligaected by any subsequent remeasurement of the asset.\n\n## 15. Leasing\n\n## Nordea as lessor\n\n## Finance leases\n\nNordea's leasing operations mainly comprise finance leases. A finance lease is reported as a receivable from the lessee in the balance sheet item 'Loans to the public' at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The lease payment, excluding cost of services, is recorded as repayment of principal and interest income. The income allocation is based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the finance lease.\n\n## Operating leases\n\nAssets subject to operating leases on the balance sheet are reported in accordance with the nature of the assets, in general as 'Properties and equipment'. Leasing income is recognised as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classified as 'Net interest income'. The depreciation of the leased assets is calculated based on Nordea's depreciation policy for similar assets and reported as 'Depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges of tangible and intangible assets' in the income statement.\n\n## Nordea as lessee\n\nAt inception Nordea assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease. A lease is a contract that conveys the user the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nThe right to use an asset in a lease contract is recognised on the commencement date as a right of use (ROU) asset and the obligation to pay lease payments is recognised as a lease liability. The ROU asset is initially measured as the present value of the lease payments plus initial direct costs and the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset less any lease incen-",

The discount rate used to calculate the lease liability for each contract is the incremental borrowing rate at commencement of the contract. In significant premises contracts the rate implicit in the contract may be used if available.\n\nThe ROU assets are presented as similar owned assets and the lease liabilities as 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. The depreciation policy is consistent with that of similar owned assets, but the depreciation period is normally capped at the end of the lease term. Impairment testing of the ROU assets is performed according to the same principles that apply to similar owned assets. Interest expense on lease liabilities is presented as 'Interest expense' in the income statement.\n\nThe assets are classified as 'Land and buildings' and 'Equipment'. Equipment mainly comprises vehicles and IT hardware. Nordea applies the practical expedient for shortterm contracts (with a contract term of 12 months or less) both for Land and buildings and for Equipment. The practical expedient for low value assets is applied to Equipment. Shortterm and low-value contracts are not recognised on the balance sheet and the payments are recognised as expenses in the income statement as 'Other expenses' on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic way better reflects the time pattern of Nordea's benefit.\n\nLeases are mainly related to o/ffi.ligace premises contracts but also to company cars, IT hardware and other assets normal to the business. The premises are mainly divided into branch o/ffi.ligaces and head o/ffi.ligaces. The premises contracts are actively managed with focus on the e/ff.ligaective use of the premises and the changes in the business environment. The lease payments generally include fixed payments and especially in premises contracts also variable payments that depend on an index. Residual value guarantees or purchase options are generally not used.\n\nThe lease term is the expected lease term. This comprises the non-cancellable period of lease contracts and any options that Nordea is reasonably certain to exercise. The length of contracts with no end date is estimated by considering all facts and circumstances.\n\nThe expected lease term of most of the premises contracts is 1-10 years whereas the expected lease term of the main head o/ffi.ligace contracts in the Nordic countries is 15-25 years. These contracts generally have renewal options.\n\n## Embedded leases\n\nAgreements can contain a right to use an asset in return for a payment, or a series of payments, although the agreement is not in the legal form of a lease contract. If applicable, these assets are separated from the contract and accounted for as leased assets.\n\n## 16. Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are identifiable, non-monetary assets without physical substance. The assets are under Nordea's control, which means that Nordea has the power and rights to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource. Nordea's intangible assets mainly consist of goodwill, IT development/computer software and customer-related intangible assets.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of Nordea's share of net identifiable assets of the acquired group undertaking/associated undertaking/ joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of group undertakings and joint ventures is included in 'Intangible assets'. Goodwill on acquisitions of associated\n\nundertakings is not recognised as a separate asset but included in 'Investments in associated undertakings'. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed in subsequent periods. Goodwill related to associated undertakings and joint ventures is not tested for impairment separately but included in the total carrying amount of the associated undertakings and the joint ventures. The policies covering impairment testing of associated undertakings and joint ventures are disclosed in section 6 'Recognition of operating income and impairment'.\n\n## IT development/Computer software\n\nCosts associated with maintaining computer software programs are expensed as incurred. Costs directly associated with major software development investments, with the ability to generate future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets. These costs include software development sta/ff.liga costs and overhead expenditures directly attributable to preparing the asset for use. Computer software also includes acquired software licences not related to the function of a tangible asset.\n\nAmortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the software, generally a period of 3 to 5 years, and in some circumstances for strategic infrastructure up to a maximum of 10 years.\n\n## Customer-related intangible assets\n\nIn business combinations a portion of the purchase price is normally allocated to a customer-related intangible asset, if the asset is identifiable and under Nordea's control. An intangible asset is identifiable if it arises from contractual or legal rights, or could be separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. The asset is amortised over its useful life, generally over 10 years.\n\n## Impairment\n\nGoodwill and IT development not yet taken into use are not amortised but tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indications of impairment. Impairment testing is also performed more frequently if required due to any indication of impairment. The impairment charge is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, all intangible assets with definite useful lives, including IT development taken into use, are reviewed for indications of impairment. If such indications exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the intangible asset is fully recoverable.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or the cash-generating unit, which is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate largely independent cash flows in relation to other assets. For goodwill and IT development not yet taken into use, the cash generating units are defined as the operating segments. The value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be realised from the asset or the cash-generating unit. The cash flows are assessed based on the asset or cash-generating unit in its current condition and discounted at a rate based on the long-term riskfree interest rate plus a risk premium. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. See Note G21 'Intangible assets' for more information on the impairment testing.",

Properties and equipment\n\nProperties and equipment include properties for own use, leasehold improvements, IT equipment, furniture and other equipment. Items of properties and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an item of property and equipment comprises its purchase price as well as any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the working condition for its intended use. When parts of an item of property and equipment have di/ff.ligaerent useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.\n\nProperties and equipment are depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The estimates of the useful life of di/ff.ligaerent assets are reassessed on a yearly basis. Below follow the current estimates:\n\nBuildings Equipment Leasehold improvements\n\n30-75  years\n\n3-5 years\n\nChanges within buildings the shorter of 10 years and the remaining lease term. New construction the shorter of the principles used for owned buildings and the remaining lease term. Fixtures installed in leased properties are depreciated over the shorter of 10-20 years and the remaining lease term.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, Nordea assesses whether there is any indication that an item of property and equipment may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated, and any impairment loss is recognised.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\n## 18. Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are primarily properties held to earn rent and/or capital appreciation. The majority of Nordea's property are attributable to Life & Pension. Nordea applies the fair value model for subsequent measurement of investment properties. The best evidence of fair value is normally quoted prices in an active market for similar properties in the same location and condition. As these prices are rarely available, discounted cash flow projection models based on reliable estimates of future cash flows are also used.\n\nNet rental income, gains and losses as well as fair value adjustments are recognised directly in the income statement as 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\n## 19. Liabilities to policyholders\n\nLiabilities to policyholders include obligations according to insurance contracts and investment contracts with policyholders for all the companies in Life & Pension, including companies in Sweden, Norway and Finland.\n\nAn insurance contract is defined as 'a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risks from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely a/ff.ligaects the policyholder'.\n\nInvestment contracts are contracts with policyholders that have the legal form of insurance contracts but where the insurance risk transfer has been assessed to be insignificant.\n\nThe insurance risk is generally calculated as the risk sum payable as a percentage of the reserve behind the contract at the beginning of the contract period.\n\n- \u00b7\n- The contracts can be divided into the following classes: Insurance contracts:\n- -  Traditional life insurance contracts with and without discretionary participation feature\n- -  Unit-linked contracts with significant insurance risk\n- -  Health and personal accident.\n- \u00b7 Investment contracts:\n- -  Investment contracts with discretionary participation feature\n- -  Investment contracts without discretionary participation feature.\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nThe measurement principles under local GAAP have been maintained, consequently resulting in a non-uniform accounting policies method on consolidation.\n\nThe measurement of traditional life insurance provisions in Finland are prepared by calculating the present value of future benefits, to which the policyholders are entitled. The calculation includes assumptions about market consistent discounting rates as well as expenses and life risk. The discount rate is based on the liabilities' current term.\n\nIn Norway the traditional life insurance provisions are mainly calculated on the basis of a prospective method. The discount rate used is equal to the original tari/ff.liga rates adjusted for assumptions about expenses and risk.\n\nThe accounting policy for each company is based on the local structure of the business and is related to the solvency rules and national regulations concerning profit sharing and other requirements about collective bonus potential (not allocated provisions that protect the policyholders).\n\nUnit-linked contracts represent life insurance provisions relating to unit-linked policies written either with or without an investment guarantee. Unit-linked contracts classified as insurance contracts include the same insurance risk elements as traditional insurance contracts. These contracts are mainly recognised and measured at fair value on the basis of:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value of the assets linked to the unit-linked contracts, and\n- \u00b7 the estimated present value of the insurance risk which is calculated in the same way as traditional insurance contracts considering the impact on every risk element included in the cash flows.\n\nHealth and personal accident provisions include premium reserves and claims outstanding. This item is recognised and measured on deferred basis, the same principle as used for general insurance contracts.\n\n## Investment contracts\n\nContracts classified as investment contracts are contracts with policyholders which do not transfer su/ffi.ligacient insurance risk to be classified as insurance contracts and are written with an investment guarantee or a discretionary participation feature.\n\nInvestment contracts with discretionary participation features are, in line with IFRS 4, accounted for as insurance contracts using local accounting principles. Life & Pension only has a small number of these contracts.\n\nInvestment contracts without discretionary participation features are recognised and measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement', equal to fair value of the assets linked to these contracts. These assets are classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss' to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch.",

        "page_content": "## G1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\n## Discretionary participating features (DPF)\n\nSome traditional life insurance contracts and investment contracts include a contractual right for the policyholder to receive significant benefits in addition to guaranteed benefits. Nordea has discretion to pay these additional benefits as bonus. These DPF-contracts, including collective bonus potential, are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nCollective bonus potential includes amounts allocated but not attributed to the policyholders. In Finland, collective bonus potential includes the policyholder's part of the total unrealised investment gains and bonus potential on paid policies and future premiums (the di/ff.ligaerence between retrospective and market-consistent prospective measurement principles of the insurance contracts). In Norway, collective bonus potential includes the policyholder's part of both the total unrealised investment gains and additional regulatory reserves. In Sweden, the main valuation principle is fair value (insurance contracts). The policyholder's part of both realised and unrealised investment gains is therefore included on the balance sheet representing either 'Change in technical provisions, life insurance' and/or 'Change in collective bonus potentials, life insurance', depending on whether the investment result is allocated or attributed. Both the mentioned lines are included in the balance sheet line item 'Liabilities to policyholders'.\n\n## Liability adequacy test\n\nThe adequacy of insurance provisions is assessed at each reporting date to ensure that the carrying amount of the liabilities is higher than the best estimate of future cash flows discounted with current interest rates. If needed, additional provisions are accounted for and recognised in the income statement.\n\n## 20. Assets and deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts\n\nDeposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts are contracts with customers and policyholders where the total risk is born by the customers or the policyholders. The deposits are invested in di/ff.ligaerent types of financial assets on behalf of the customers and policyholders.\n\nUnit-linked investment contracts include investment contracts written without any investment guarantees and which do not transfer su/ffi.ligacient insurance risk to be classified as insurance contracts.\n\nThe assets and deposits under these contracts are recognised and measured at fair value as described in section 13 'Financial instrument' above.\n\n## 21. Taxes\n\nThe item 'Income tax expense' in the income statement comprises current and deferred income tax. The income tax expense is recognised in the income statement unless the tax e/ff.ligaect relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax e/ff.ligaect is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax expense on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, using the balance sheet method, for temporary di/ff.ligaerences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits. Deferred tax is not recognised for\n\ntemporary di/ff.ligaerences arising on initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that a/ff.ligaects neither accounting nor taxable profit, nor for di/ff.ligaerences relating to investments in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary di/ff.ligaerences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary di/ff.ligaerences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary di/ff.ligaerences, tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nTax positions are regularly reviewed to identify situations where it is not probable that the relevant tax authorities will accept the treatment used in the tax filings. Uncertain tax positions are considered independently or as a group, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. If Nordea concludes that it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the e/ff.ligaect of uncertainty is reflected when determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. This is done by using either the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method better predicts the outcome of the uncertainty. Uncertain tax treatment can a/ff.ligaect both current tax and deferred tax.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are o/ff.ligaset when the legal right to o/ff.ligaset exists and Nordea intends to either settle the tax asset and the tax liability net or recover the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally o/ff.ligaset if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ff.ligaset current tax assets and current tax liabilities.\n\n## 22. Provisions\n\nProvisions (which are presented as a liability) are recognised when Nordea has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event if it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\nProvisions relating to employee benefits are further described in section 24 and provisions relating to financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments are described in section 26.\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognised as liabilities on the balance sheet but disclosed in Note G38 'Contingent liabilities' unless the possibility of an outflow is remote. A contingent liability is a possible obligation whose existence will be confirmed only by future event(s) not wholly within Nordea's control or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with su/ffi.ligacient reliability.\n\n## 23. Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to shareholders of Nordea Bank Abp by",

        "page_content": "## G1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\nthe weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are determined by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the e/ff.ligaects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, consisting of rights to performance shares in the long-term incentive programmes and contracts on Nordea shares that can be settled in Nordea shares, i.e. derivatives such as options and warrants and their equivalents. Such contracts a/ff.ligaect diluted earnings per share when and only when the average price of ordinary shares during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options or warrants (i.e. they are in the money).\n\nThe potential ordinary shares are only considered to be dilutive on the balance sheet date, if all performance conditions are fulfilled and if a conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share. The rights are furthermore considered dilutive only when the exercise price, with the addition of future services, is lower than the period's average share price.\n\n## 24. Employee benefits\n\nAll forms of consideration given by Nordea to its employees as compensation for services performed are employee benefits. Short-term benefits are to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period when the services have been performed. Post-employment benefits are benefits payable after termination of the employment. Post-employment benefits in Nordea consist only of pensions. Termination benefits normally arise if employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or if an employee accepts an o/ff.ligaer of voluntary redundancy.\n\n## Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. Both fixed and variable salaries are expensed in the period when the employees have performed services to Nordea. Nordea has also issued share-based payment programmes, which are further described in section 27 'Share-based payment'.\n\nMore information can be found in Note G8 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.\n\n## Post-employment benefits Pension plans\n\nThe companies within Nordea have various pension plans, consisting of both defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans, reflecting national practices and conditions in the countries where Nordea operates. Defined benefit pension plans are predominantly sponsored in Sweden, Norway and Finland. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded schemes covered by assets in pension funds/foundations. If the fair value of plan assets associated with a specific pension plan, is lower than the gross present value of the defined benefit obligation determined using the projected unit credit method, the net amount is recognised as a liability ('Retirement benefit liabilities'). If not, the net amount is recognised as an asset ('Retirement benefit assets'). Non-funded pension plans are recognised as 'Retirement benefit liabilities'.\n\nMost pensions in Denmark, but also plans in other countries, are based on defined contribution arrangements that hold no pension liability for Nordea. All defined benefit pension plans are closed for new employees. Nordea also contributes to public pension systems.\n\n## Pension costs\n\nObligations for defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense as the employee renders services to the\n\nentity and the contribution payable in exchange for that service becomes due. Nordea's net obligation for defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Actuarial calculations, including the projected unit credit method, are applied to assess the present value of defined benefit obligations and related costs, based on several actuarial and financial assumptions (as disclosed in Note G34 'Retirement benefit obligations').\n\nWhen establishing the present value of the obligation and the fair value of any plan assets, remeasurement e/ff.ligaects may arise as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience e/ff.ligaects (actual outcome compared to assumptions). The remeasurement e/ff.ligaects are recognised immediately in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen the calculation results in a benefit, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nSocial security contributions are calculated and accounted for based on the net recognised surplus or deficit by plan and are included on the balance sheet as 'Retirement benefit liabilities' or 'Retirement benefit assets'.\n\n## Discount rate in defined benefit pension plans\n\nThe discount rate is determined by reference to high-quality corporate bonds where a deep enough market for such bonds exists. Covered bonds are in this context considered to be corporate bonds. In countries where no such market exists, the discount rate is determined by reference to government bond yields. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark the discount rate is determined with reference to covered bonds and in Finland with reference to corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark the observed covered bond credit spreads over the swap curve are derived from the most liquid long-dated covered bonds and extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the relevant swap curves. In Finland the corporate bond credit spread over the government bond rate is extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the government bond curve.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nAs mentioned above, termination benefits normally arise if employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or if an employee accepts an o/ff.ligaer of voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits do not arise if the employees have to continue performing services and the termination benefits can be considered to be normal compensation for those services.\n\nTermination benefits are expensed when Nordea has an obligation to make the payment. An obligation arises when there is a formal plan committed to on the appropriate organisational level and when Nordea is without realistic possibility of withdrawal, which normally occurs when the plan has been communicated to the group a/ff.ligaected or to their representatives.\n\nTermination benefits can include both short-term benefits, for instance a number of months' salary, and post-employment benefits, normally in the form of early retirement. Shortterm benefits are classified as 'Salaries and remuneration' and post-employment benefits as 'Pension costs' in Note G8 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.",

Equity\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests comprise the portion of net assets of group undertakings not owned directly or indirectly by Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nFor each business combination, Nordea measures the noncontrolling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\n## Additional Tier 1 capital holders\n\nNordea has issued perpetual subordinated instruments where the interest payments to the holders are at the discretion of Nordea and non-accumulating. Some of these instruments also include a requirement for Nordea to pay interest if the instruments are no longer allowed to be included in Tier 1 capital. If there is a requirement to pay interest based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of an uncertain future event that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instrument, the instrument is classified as a financial liability. The inclusion of the subordinated loan in Tier 1 capital is decided by the regulators and is thus beyond the control of Nordea and the holders of the instrument. Nordea classifies the instruments as financial liabilities. Instruments without such clauses are classified as equity as there is no requirement for Nordea to pay interest or principal to the holders of the instruments.\n\nNordea determines payments on financial instrument classified as equity (i.e. Additional Tier 1 instruments) as distribution of profits and for that reason such payments are accounted for as dividends.\n\n## Invested unrestricted equity\n\nThe reserve consists of the di/ff.ligaerence between the subscription price and the quota value of the shares in Nordea's rights issue in 2009. Transaction costs in connection with the rights issue have been deducted. For acquisitions and sales of own shares see section 25 'Treasury shares'.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nOther reserves comprise income and expenses, net of tax e/ff.ligaects, which are reported in equity through other comprehensive income. These reserves include reserves for cash flow hedges, financial assets classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' and accumulated remeasurements of defined benefit pension plans as well as a reserve for translation di/ff.ligaerences.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nApart from undistributed profits from previous years, retained earnings include the equity portion of untaxed reserves. Untaxed reserves according to national rules are accounted for as equity net of deferred tax at prevailing tax rates in the respective country.\n\nIn addition, Nordea's share of the earnings in associated undertakings and joint ventures, after the acquisition date, that have not been distributed is included in retained earnings.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are not accounted for as assets, but as a reduction of equity. Acquisitions of treasury shares as part of the Markets trading operations are recognised as a reduction in 'Invested unrestricted equity' and sales of own shares in the trading operations as an increase in 'Invested unrestricted equity'. Treasury shares acquired to optimise the capital structure are recognised as a reduction in 'Retained earn-\n\nings'. There is no impact on the financial statements when shares are cancelled. Transaction costs related to repurchasing of treasury shares are also recognised in equity.\n\nContracts on Nordea shares that can be settled net in cash, i.e. derivatives such as options and warrants and their equivalents, are either presented as financial assets or financial liabilities.\n\n## 26. Financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments\n\nUpon initial recognition, premiums received in issued financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments are recognised as prepaid income on the balance sheet. The guarantees and irrevocable credit commitments are subsequently measured and recognised as a provision on the balance sheet at the higher of either the fee received less amortisation or an amount calculated in accordance with IFRS 9. Changes in provisions are recognised in the income statement in the item 'Net loan losses'.\n\nPremiums received for financial guarantees are, as stated in section 6 'Recognition of operating income and impairment', amortised over the guarantee period and recognised as 'Fee and commission income' in the income statement. Premiums received on credit commitments are generally amortised over the loan commitment period. The contractual amounts are recognised o/ff.liga-balance sheet, net of any provisions. Financial guarantees are disclosed in the item 'Contingent liabilities' and irrevocable credit commitments in the item 'Commitments'.\n\n## 27. Share-based payment\n\n## Equity-settled programmes\n\nNordea has annually issued programmes where employees participating in these programmes are granted share-based equity-settled rights, i.e. rights to receive shares for free or to acquire shares in Nordea at a significant discount compared to the share price at grant date.\n\nThe grant date fair value of these rights is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value per right is estimated at grant date and not subsequently updated. The vesting period is the period over which the employees have to remain in service at Nordea in order for their rights to vest.\n\nFor rights with non-market performance conditions, the amount expensed is the grant date fair value per right multiplied by the best estimate of rights that will eventually vest, which is reassessed at each reporting date. For rights with market performance conditions, the total fair value is estimated based on the fair value of each right times the maximum number of rights at grant date. Market conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Therefore, if all other vesting conditions (e.g. service condition) are met, Nordea recognises the expense for grants of equity instruments with market conditions irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied.\n\nSocial security costs are also allocated over the vesting period. The provision for social security costs is reassessed on each reporting date to ensure that the provision is based on the rights' fair value at the reporting date.\n\nFor more information see Note G8 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.\n\n## Cash-settled programmes\n\nNordea has to defer payment of variable salaries under the Nordic FSAs' regulations and general guidelines, as is also the case with the Executive Incentive Programme (EIP). The deferred amounts are to some extent indexed using Nordea's Total Shareholders' Return (TRS) and these programmes are",

These programmes are fully vested when the payment of variable salaries is initially deferred, and the fair value of the obligation is remeasured on a continuous basis over the deferral period using the Nordea TSR. The remeasurements are, together with the related social charges, recognised in the income statement in the item 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nFor more information see Note G8 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.\n\n## 28. Related party transactions\n\nNordea defines related parties as:\n\n- \u00b7 shareholders with significant influence\n- \u00b7 associated undertakings and joint ventures\n- \u00b7 key management personnel\n- \u00b7 other related parties.\n\nAll transactions with related parties are made on the same criteria and terms as those of comparable transactions with external parties of similar standing, apart from loans granted to employees as well as certain other commitments to key management personnel, see Note G8 'Sta/ff.liga costs' and Note G38 'Contingent liabilities'.\n\n## Shareholders with significant influence\n\nShareholders with significant influence are shareholders that have the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of Nordea but do not control those policies.\n\n## Associated undertakings and joint ventures\n\nFor the definition of associated undertakings and joint ventures, see section 5 'Principles of consolidation'.\n\nFurther information on the associated undertakings and the joint ventures included in the Nordea Group is found in Note G20 'Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures'.\n\n## Key management personnel\n\nKey management personnel includes the following positions:\n\n- \u00b7 Board of Directors\n- \u00b7 Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO)\n- \u00b7 Group Leadership Team (GLT).\n\nFor information about compensation, pensions and other transactions with key management personnel, see Note G8 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.\n\n## Other related parties\n\nOther related parties comprise shareholders with significant influence (including their subsidiaries) and close family members of key management personnel at Nordea as well as companies controlled or jointly controlled by key management personnel or by close family members of key management personnel at Nordea. Information concerning transactions between Nordea and other related parties is found in Note G45 'Related party transactions'.\n\n## 29. Presentation of disposal groups held for sale\n\nIf applicable, assets and liabilities related to disposal groups are presented on the separate balance sheet lines 'Assets held for sale' and 'Liabilities held for sale', respectively, as from the classification date. Financial instruments continue to be measured under IFRS 9, while non-financial assets are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value. Comparative figures are not restated.\n\n## 30.

Risk governance\n\nMaintaining risk awareness in the organisation is an integral part of Nordea's business strategies. Nordea has defined clear risk and liquidity management frameworks including policies and instructions for di/ff.ligaerent risk types, capital adequacy and capital structure.\n\nIn 2021 COVID-19 continued to have a considerable impact on society at large. Nordea has continued to focus on maintaining service levels towards our customers, complying at all times with the government instructions regarding COVID-19.\n\n/one.osf/two.osf /eight.osf\n\nMarket volatility has persisted due to the pandemic, and Nordea has continued to run full-scale risk management capabilities to ensure fair treatment of our customers and integrity in the market. With its strong financial position, Nordea is able to continue to actively support its customers during this challenging time. Nordic governments have supported the economies with a range of COVID-related support packages targeted at individuals and companies. As the pandemic prolonged in 2021, the measures were extended and new ones established. However, the support measures are coming to an end and possible cli/ff.liga-edge e/ff.ligaects could materialise related to deferred payments since there is a risk that support measures have enabled non-viable businesses to continue operating. Termination of instalment-free schemes and downscaling of governmental support measures have not had practical implications on the household portfolio quality and the Nordic housing markets have performed strongly. A downside risk exists, in particular due to the possible spread of new COVID-19 variants. In order to continuously monitor potential adverse outcomes, Nordea has executed a number of internal stress tests with focus on the COVID-19 situation. In these stress tests, Nordea's capital and liquidity situation has shown good resilience even in the most severe scenarios.\n\n## 1.1 Internal Control Framework\n\nThe Internal Control Framework covers the whole Group and it sets out the Group Board's and senior management's responsibilities regarding internal control, all Group functions and business areas including outsourced activities and distribution channels. Under the Internal Control Framework, all business areas, Group functions and units are responsible for managing the risks they incur in conducting their activities and for having controls in place that aim to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. As part of the Internal Control Framework, Nordea has established Group control functions with appropriate and su/ffi.ligacient authority, stature and access to the Group Board to fulfil their mission as well as the Risk Management Framework.\n\nThe Internal Control Framework ensures e/ff.ligaective and e/ffi.ligacient operations, adequate identification, measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of financial and non-financial information (both internal and external) and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, supervisory requirements and Group internal rules.\n\nThe internal control process is carried out by the governing bodies, risk management functions, management and other sta/ff.liga at Nordea. The internal control process is based on five main components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication as well as monitoring. The internal control process is created to ensure the necessary fundamentals for the entire organisation to contribute to the e/ff.ligaectiveness and high quality of internal control  through,  for  instance,  clear  definitions,  assignments  of roles and responsibilities and common tools and procedures.\n\n## 1.2 Governing bodies for risk, liquidity and capital management\n\nThe Group Board, the Board Risk Committee (BRIC), the Group CEO in Group Leadership Team (GLT), the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee (RC) are the key decision-making bodies for risk, liquidity and capital management at Nordea. In addition, the CEO Credit Committee, the Executive Credit Committee and business area credit committees are the key bodies for credit decision-making.",

        "page_content": "## G2. Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## Group Board and Board Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Board has the following overarching risk management responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 It decides on the Group risk strategy and the Risk Appetite Framework, including the risk appetite statements, with annual reviews and additional updates when needed.\n- \u00b7 It oversees and monitors the implementation of the Risk Strategy, Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Management Framework, including breaches of risk appetite.\n\nThe Group Board decides on the Group Board Directive on Capital including the dividend policy. The directive ensures that the Group maintains adequate capital levels on an ongoing and forward-looking basis in accordance with Nordea's business model, risk appetite and regulatory requirements and expectations.\n\nBRIC assists the Group Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning management and control of the risk, risk frameworks, controls and processes associated with the Group's operations.\n\n## President and Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer\n\nThe Group CEO is responsible to the Group Board for the overall management of the Group's operations and risks. Responsibilities include ensuring that the risk strategy and risk management decided by the Group Board is implemented, the necessary practical measures are taken and risks are monitored and limited. The Group CEO is supported in decision-making by senior management within the GLT.\n\nGroup-wide committees have been established in order to promote coordination within the Group, thus ensuring commitment to and ownership of Group-wide prioritisations, decisions and implementation. The composition and areas of responsibility of each committee are established in the Group Board Directives or Group CEO Instructions for the respective committees.\n\n## Asset and Liability Committee\n\nThe Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) is subordinate to the Group CEO in GLT and chaired by the Chief Financial O/ffi.ligacer (CFO). ALCO decides on changes to the financial operations and the risk profile of the balance sheet, including asset and liability management (ALM), balance sheet management and liquidity management. ALCO also decides on certain issuances and capital injections for all wholly-owned legal entities within the Group. ALCO has established sub-committees for its work and decision-making within specific risk areas.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nThe Risk Committee (RC) is subordinate to the Group CEO in GLT and chaired by the Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer. The RC manages the overarching Risk Management Framework and prepares or provides guidance regarding proposals to the Group CEO in GLT and/or the relevant Board of Directors on issues of major importance concerning Nordea's Risk Management Framework. Based on the Risk Appetite Framework decided by the Group Board, the RC decides on the allocation of cascaded risks limits to risk-taking units and on actions relating to the management of all risks. The first line of defence is responsible for ensuring that limits are allocated and implemented across business. The RC has established sub-committees for its work and decision-making within specific risk areas.\n\n## Credit decision-making bodies\n\nThe governing bodies for credit risk and/or the Credit Risk Management Framework are the Group Board and BRIC. The Group Board and the local Board of Directors delegate credit decision-making according to the powers to act as described in the Group Board Directive for Risk:\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO Credit Committee is chaired by the Group CEO and its members include the members of the Executive Credit Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Executive Credit Committee is chaired by the Head of Group Credit Management, and BRIC appoints the members of the Executive Credit Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Executive Credit Committee establishes credit committees for each business area as required by organisational needs and customer segmentation.\n\nBRIC confirms industry group strategies approved by the RC.\n\nAll credit limits within the Nordea Group are based on credit decisions or authorisations made by an ultimate decision-making authority with the right to decide upon that limit. Credit decisions include pricing, risk mitigation and any terms and conditions related to the limit or expected utilisation. Credit decisions also serve to delegate decision-making within the approved limit to lower-level decision-makers unless otherwise explicitly decided.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nAt subsidiary level, the subsidiary's Board of Directors is responsible for approving risk appetite limits and capital actions. These proposals are the joint responsibility of the relevant subsidiary management and Group functions. The subsidiary Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities concerning the management and control of risk, risk management frameworks as well as the processes associated with the subsidiary's operations. In addition, there are risk management functions responsible for the risk management framework and processes within the subsidiary. The subsidiary CEO is part of the decision-making process at subsidiary level and is responsible for the daily operations.\n\n## 1.3 Governance of risk management and compliance\n\nGroup Risk and Group Compliance constitute Nordea's independent second line of defence functions. Group Risk oversees the implementation of the Group risk policies (excluding compliance risk) and, according to a risk-based approach, monitors and controls the Risk Management Framework. Group Compliance oversees the implementation of the Compliance Risk Management Framework, which is a part of the overarching Risk Management Framework. These frameworks ensure that the risks that Nordea is or could be exposed to are identified, assessed, monitored, managed and reported. The second line of defence is organised in divisions with individual responsibility for di/ff.ligaerent types of risk. The Risk Management Framework ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing and measuring, responding to and mitigating, controlling and monitoring and reporting risks to enable informed decisions on risk-taking.\n\nThe Risk Management Framework encompasses all risks to which Nordea is or could be exposed, including ESG as drivers of existing risks, o/ff.liga-balance  sheet risks and risks in a stressed situation. Detailed risk information covering all risks is regularly reported to the RC, the GLT, BRIC and the Group Board. In addition to this, Nordea's compliance with regulatory requirements is reported to the RC, the GLT, BRIC and the Group Board. The Group Board and the CEO in each legal entity regularly receive local risk reporting.\n\nThe Risk Identification and Materiality Assessment Process starts with identifying risks to which Nordea is or could be exposed. Risks are then assessed for relevance, classified and included in the Common Risk Taxonomy.\n\nAll risks within the Nordea Common Risk Taxonomy need to be classified as material or not material for risk management and capital purposes. Material risks are those assessed as having a material impact on Nordea's current and future financial position, its customers and stakeholders. These risks",

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\nwill typically refer to a higher level within the risk taxonomy, which captures a number of underlying risks where losses arise from a common source.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) supports e/ff.ligaective risk management and a sound risk culture by enabling informed decisions on risk-taking, with the objective of ensuring that risk-taking activities are conducted within the organisation's risk appetite and that emerging risks are identified and addressed in a timely way.\n\nRisk capacity is the maximum level of risk Nordea is deemed able to assume given its capital (own funds), its risk management and control capabilities and its regulatory constraints. Risk appetite is the aggregate level and types of risk Nordea is willing to assume within its risk capacity and in line with its business model to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nThe risk appetite statements are the articulation of the Group Board approved risk appetite and comprise the qualitative statements and quantitative limits and triggers by main risk type deemed appropriate to be able to operate with a prudent risk profile.\n\nCredit concentration metrics cover e.g. sectors and geographic regions of size or importance. Stress test metrics are applied to credit, market and liquidity risk metrics to ensure a forward-looking approach to risk management. Operational risk metrics cover both residual risk levels and requirements for mitigating actions as well as limits for incidents and losses.\n\n## Risk appetite processes\n\nThe RAF contains all processes and controls to establish, monitor and communicate Nordea's risk appetite:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk capacity setting based on capital position: On at least an annual basis, the Group's overall risk capacity is aligned with the financial and capital planning process, based on Nordea's risk strategy. The risk capacity is set in line with Nordea's capital position, including an appropriate shockabsorbing capacity.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite allocation by risk type: Risk appetite includes risk appetite limits for the main risk types that Nordea is or could be exposed to. Risk appetite triggers are also set for these main risk types, to act as early indicators for key decision-makers that the risk profile for a particular risk type is approaching its risk appetite limit.\n- \u00b7 Risk limit setting: Measurable risk limits are established and set at an appropriate level to manage risk-taking e/ff.ligaectively. Risk appetite limits are set by the Group Board. These form the basis for setting the risk limits which are established and approved at lower decision-making levels at Nordea, including RC and sub-RC levels, and also other levels as appropriate. Subsidiary risk limits must be set by the appropriate governing body in accordance with local regulatory requirements and Group risk limits.\n- \u00b7 Controlling and monitoring risk exposures against risk limits: Regular controlling and monitoring of risk exposures compared to risk limits are carried out to ensure that risktaking activity remains within the risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite limit breach management process: Group Risk and Group Compliance oversee that any risk appetite limit breaches are appropriately escalated to the RC and BRIC. The second line of defence reports monthly on any breaches of the risk appetite to the Group Board and other relevant governing bodies including a follow-up on the status of actions to be taken, until the relevant risk exposure is\n\nwithin appetite. The reporting includes a consistent status indicator to communicate the current risk exposure compared to the risk appetite limit for all risk types covered by the risk appetite statements.\n\n## Embedding risk appetite in business processes\n\nThe end-to-end risk appetite process cycle is aligned with other strategic processes, including the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) and the Recovery Plan.\n\nMoreover, the risk appetite is embedded in business processes and communicated across the organisation in order to meet Nordea's objectives of maintaining a sound risk culture. This includes but is not limited to ensuring a strong link between the assessed risk appetite and the business plans and budgets, the capital and liquidity position, the systemic risk profile, the recoverability and resolvability assessments as well as the incentive structures and remuneration framework.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Governance\n\nAt Nordea, the Group Board has a leading role in driving the sustainability strategy and is assisted by the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee in the fulfilment of its oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability, related frameworks and processes. The Group Board is also assisted by BRIC in the fulfilment of its oversight responsibilities concerning the management of risks, related frameworks, controls and processes (including ESG factors as drivers of existing risks). Qualitative progress updates on the integration of ESG factors in the underlying risk management frameworks form part of the regular Board Risk Appetite reporting. The Board Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the reporting and disclosure policies.\n\nAt Group Leadership Team level, the Sustainability and Ethics Committee is mandated to facilitate the implementation of the sustainability targets and objectives and support the integration of ESG factors in operational credit risk management. The Risk Committee (RC) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the risk strategy including in relation to embedding ESG factors as drivers of existing risks.\n\nOrganisationally, ESG is integrated in existing processes for decision-making, risk management and control as well as escalation, including committee structures. The first line of defence is responsible for managing sustainability and financial impacts while the second line of defence is accountable for developing the ESG-related risk management framework.\n\nIn 2021, Nordea appointed the Chief of Sta/ff.liga to coordinate and facilitate the Group-wide integration of ESG factors in the Risk Management Framework and business processes. Consequently, a new ESG implementation programme was launched under a newly established operational steering committee. The programme, which integrates first and second line of defence e/ff.ligaorts, aims at ensuring an e/ffi.ligacient and consistent implementation of both the sustainability targets and objectives as well as the ESG-related risk management frameworks across key areas including credit processes, risk scoring of customers, reporting and regulatory compliance.\n\n## 1.4 Disclosure requirements of the Capital Requirements Regulation - Capital and Risk Management Report 2021\n\nAdditional information on risk and capital management is presented in the Capital and Risk Management Report 2021, in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation.",

Nordea strives to have a well-diversified credit portfolio that is adapted to the structure of its home markets and economies. Nordea's loan portfolio is split by type of exposure classes (corporate and retail) or by sector, then further broken down by segment, industry and geography and reported monthly, quarterly and annually.\n\nThe key principles for managing Nordea's risk exposures are:\n\n- \u00b7 risk-based approach, i.e. the risk management functions should be aligned to the nature, size and complexity of Nordea's business, ensuring that e/ff.ligaorts undertaken are proportional to the risks in question\n- \u00b7 independence, i.e. the risk control function should be independent of the business it controls\n- \u00b7 three lines of defence, as further described in the Group Board Directive on Internal Governance.\n\nGroup Credit Management is the first line of defence and is responsible for the credit process and Industry Credit Policies. Group Credit Risk Control and Model Validation is the second line of defence and is responsible for the credit risk framework, consisting of instructions and guidelines for the Group. Group Credit Risk Control and Model Valuation is also responsible for controlling and monitoring the quality of the credit portfolio and the credit process.\n\nThe basis of credit risk management at Nordea is allocating limits to customers and customer groups which are aggregated and assigned to units responsible for their continuous monitoring and development. In addition to the procedures for allocating customer and customer group limits, Nordea's credit risk management framework also includes the credit RAF which provides a comprehensive and risk-\n\n## Credit committee structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Level 1   | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                         | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                         | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                         | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                         | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                                          | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                                          | Board of Directors / Board Risk Committee                                                          |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Level 2   | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee                  | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee                  | Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) Credit Committee / Executive Credit Committee                  |\n| Level 3   | Leverage Buyout   and Mergers   and Acquisitions   Credit   Committee             | Real Estate   Management   Industry and   Construction   Credit   Committee       | Corporate  Large    Corporations   and Institutions   Credit   Committee          | Corporate   Business   Banking   Credit   Committee                               | Int.

Each division/unit is primarily responsible for managing the credit risks in its operations within the applicable framework and limits, including identification, control and reporting.\n\nWithin the powers to act granted by the Board of Directors, internal credit risk limits are approved by credit decision making authorities on di/ff.ligaerent levels of the organisation constituting the maximum risk appetite in relation to the customer in question. Individual credit decisions within the approved internal credit risk limit are taken within the customer responsible unit (CRU). The risk categorisation together with the exposure of the customer decides at what level the credit decision will be made. Responsibility for a credit risk lies with the CRU. Customers are classified according to risk and assigned a rating or a score in accordance with Nordea's rating and scoring guidelines. The rating and scoring of customers aim to predict their probability of default and consequently rank them according to their respective default risk. Rating and scoring are used as integrated parts of credit risk management and the credit decision-making process. Representatives from the first line of defence credit organisation approve the rating independently.\n\n## 2.1 Credit risk definition and identification\n\nCredit risk is defined as the potential for loss due to failure of a borrower to meet its obligations to pay a debt in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The potential for loss is lowered by credit risk mitigation techniques. Credit risk mainly stems from various forms of lending, as well as from issued guarantees and documentary credits and includes counterparty credit risk, transfer risk and settlement risk.\n\nNordea's loan portfolio is furthermore broken down by segment, industry and geography. Industry credit policies are established for those industries that have a significant weight",

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\nin the portfolio and/or are either highly cyclical or volatile or require special industry competencies.\n\nCredit decisions are reached after a credit risk assessment, based on principles that are defined consistently across the Group. These principles emphasise the need to adjust the depth and scope of the assessment according to the risk. The same credit risk assessments are used as input for determining the internal ratings. Credit decisions at Nordea reflect Nordea's view of both the customer relationship and the credit risk.\n\nThe ESG evaluation of large corporate borrowers is currently integrated in the credit process through the Nordea Group credit risk framework.\n\nThere are di/ff.ligaerent types of ESG evaluations performed dependent on the type and size of the transaction and the customer's internal segmentation.\n\nESG-related risks identified in the ESG evaluation process are integrated into the credit risk assessment. A credit memorandum is produced, which contains a conclusion on the level of ESG-related risk associated with the customer. Approval follows the established credit decision-making process. For customers classified as having high ESG-related risk, the decision is escalated to the Executive Credit Committee (ECC).\n\nThe overall credit risk assessment is a combined risk conclusion on the borrower's repayment capacity and recovery position. The risk conclusion must be su/ffi.ligaciently forwardlooking in relation to the risk profile of the customer and maturity of the transaction.\n\nIn addition to the credit risk assessment made in connection with a new or changed exposure in relation to a customer, an annual or ongoing credit review process is in place. The review process is an important part of the ongoing credit assessment process.\n\nIf credit weakness is identified in relation to a customer exposure, the customer is classified as 'high risk' and receives special attention in terms of more frequent reviews. In addition to the ongoing monitoring, an action plan is established outlining how to minimise the potential credit loss. If necessary, a work-out team is established up to support the customer responsible unit.\n\n## 2.2 Credit risk mitigation\n\nCredit risk mitigation is an inherent part of the credit decision process. In every credit decision and review, the valuation of collateral is considered as well as the adequacy of covenants and other risk mitigations. A fundamental credit risk mitigation technique used by Nordea is to obtain collateral. Collateral is always required, when reasonable and possible, to minimise the risk of credit losses.\n\nIn corporate exposures, the main collateral types are real estate, floating charges and leasing objects. Collateral coverage should generally be higher for exposures of financially weaker customers than for those who are financially strong.\n\nIndependent of the strength of collateral position, the repayment capacity is the starting point for the credit assessment and the assignment of credit limits. Regarding large exposures, syndication of loans is the primary tool for managing concentration risk, while credit risk mitigation using credit default swaps is applied to a limited extent. Covenants included in credit agreements are complementary to collateral protection.\n\nMost exposures of substantial size and complexity include appropriate covenants. Covenants provide early warning signs that enable Nordea to detect, and react on, a deterioration in the borrower's credit quality or overall performance. Covenant breaches allow Nordea to cancel the credit facility and demand repayment of the outstanding credits.\n\nThe collateral value should always be based on the market value. The market value is defined as the estimated amount for which the asset or liability would exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. From this market value, a haircut is applied. The haircut is defined as a percentage by which the asset's market value is reduced ensuring a margin against loss. The margin reflects the adjustments needed to assess the cash proceeds when the collateral is liquidated in a forced sale situation. A minimum haircut is set for each collateral type. In addition to the haircut, potential higher-ranking claims are also deducted from the market value when calculating the maximum collateral value.\n\nThe same principles of calculation must be used for all exposures. For high-risk customers, the foreclosure value may di/ff.ligaer from the maximum collateral value and should be based on a realistic assessment for the particular asset at that time. Risk transfer to other creditworthy parties, through guarantees and insurance, must be based on legally enforceable documentation.\n\n## 2.3 Collateral distribution\n\nDistribution of collateral has remained stable during 2021, with the majority of the collateral stemming from residential and commercial real estate with 93% (93%). The shares of commercial real estate declined to 18% (19%), while residential real estate increased to 75% (74%). Other collateral groups remained roughly at the same shares during 2021.\n\n## Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\n|                                                |          | 31 Dec 2021                                                         | 31 Dec 2021                                             | 31 Dec 2020                                                         | 31 Dec 2020                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| EURm                                           | Note     | Amortised cost and  Fair value through  other comprehensive  income | Financial assets at  fair value through  profit or loss | Amortised cost and  Fair value through  other comprehensive  income | Financial assets at  fair value through  profit or loss |\n| Loans to central banks and credit institutions | G14      | 1,799                                                               | 596                                                     | 4,409                                                               | 1,841                                                   |\n| Loans to the public                            | G14      | 272,077                                                             | 75,176                                                  | 259,433                                                             | 72,776                                                  |\n| Interest-bearing securities                    | G15, G16 | 37,435                                                              | 27,631                                                  | 37,022                                                              | 29,285                                                  |\n| Derivatives                                    | G19      | -                                                                   | 30,200                                                  | -                                                                   | 44,770                                                  |\n| O/ff.liga-balance sheet items                  | G38, G39 | 107,815                                                             | 366                                                     | 106,911                                                             | 203                                                     |\n| Total                                          |          | 419,126                                                             | 133,969                                                 | 407,775                                                             | 148,875                                                 |",

Stage 1 includes assets with no significant increase in credit risk, stage 2 includes assets with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR), and stage 3 includes defaulted assets (credit impaired). All assets are assessed individually for staging. Significant assets in stage 3 are assessed for impairment individually. Assets in stage 1, stage 2 and insignificant assets in stage 3 are assessed for impairment collectively.\n\nThroughout the process of identifying and mitigating credit impairment, Nordea continuously reviews the quality of credit exposures. Weak and credit impaired exposures are closely monitored and reviewed at least on a quarterly basis in terms of current performance, business outlook, future debt service capacity and the possible need for individual provisions.\n\nSpecific Credit Risk Adjustments (SCRAs) comprise individually and collectively assessed provisions. SCRAs in the profit and loss statement are referred to as loan losses, while SCRAs in the balance sheet are referred to as allowances and provisions. SCRAs that comprise individually assessed provisions are a trigger for default.\n\n## Individual provisioning\n\nA need for individual provisioning is recognised if, based on credit events and observable data, a negative impact is likely on the customer's expected future cash flow to the extent that full repayment is unlikely (pledged collateral taken into account).\n\nExposures with individually assigned provisions are credit Impaired and in stage 3 (defaulted). The size of the provision is equal to the estimated loss, which is the di/ff.ligaerence between the book value of the outstanding exposure and the discounted value of the expected future cash flow, including the value of pledged collateral.\n\n## Collective provisioning\n\nThe collective model is executed quarterly and assessed for each legal unit/branch. One important driver for provisions is the trigger for transferring assets from stage 1 to stage 2. For assets recognised from 1 January 2018, changes to the lifetime probability of default (PD) are used as the trigger. In addition, customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to stage 2. In stage 1, the provisions equal the 12-month expected losses. In stages 2 and 3, the provisions equal the lifetime expected losses. The output is complemented by an expertbased analysis process to ensure adequate provisioning. Defaulted customers without individual provisions have collective provisions.\n\n## Default\n\nCustomers with exposures that are past due more than 90 days, in bankruptcy or considered unlikely to pay (UTP) are regarded as defaulted and non-performing. Such customers can be either servicing debt or non-servicing.\n\nIf a customer recovers from being in default, the customer is seen as cured. Typically, this situation occurs if the customer succeeds in creating a balance in financials. In order to be cured, the recovery should include the customer's total liabilities, an established satisfactory repayment plan and an assessment that the recovery is underway.",

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## 2.7 Forbearance\n\nForbearance is eased terms or restructuring due to the borrower experiencing or about to experience financial di/ffi.ligaculties. The intention of granting forbearance for a limited time period is to ensure full repayment of the outstanding debt. Examples of eased terms are changes in amortisation profile, repayment schedule, customer margin as well as ease of financial covenants. Forbearance is undertaken on a selective and individual basis, approved according to the powers to act. Individual loan loss provisions are recognised if necessary. Forborne exposures can be performing or non-performing.\n\nFrom March 2020 to October 2020 Nordea supported customers a/ff.ligaected by the COVID-19 crisis by o/ff.ligaering instalmentfree periods. On 1 October 2020 Nordea ended all temporary amendments to the credit risk framework and returned to its normal forbearance registration procedures, while still continuing to support customers through the crisis. All COVID19-related instalment-free periods expired during the third quarter of 2021. At this time only 3% of the customers who were granted instalment-free periods due to the pandemic were classified as forborne (or in default).\n\n## Forbearance\n\n| EURm                                                              | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forborne loans                                                    | 3,270         | 2,983         |\n| - of which defaulted                                              | 1,905         | 1,711         |\n| Allowances for individually assessed impaired  and forborne loans | 497           | 465           |\n| - of which defaulted                                              | 448           | 434           |\n\n| Key ratios                          | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forbearance ratio/one.numr          | 0.9%          | 0.9%          |\n| Forbearance coverage ratio/two.numr | 15%           | 16%           |\n| - of which defaulted                | 24%           | 25%           |\n\n## 2.8 Sensitivities\n\nOne important factor in estimating expected credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 is to assess what constitutes a significant increase in credit risk. To understand the sensitivities to these triggers, Nordea has calculated model-based provisions under two di/ff.ligaerent scenarios:\n\n|                             | Triggers   | Scenario 1   | Scenario 2   |\n|-----------------------------|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Retail portfolios           |            |              |              |\n| Relative threshold          | 100%       | 50%          | 150%         |\n| Absolute 12-month threshold | 45 bp      | 35 bp        | 55 bp        |\n| Absolute lifetime threshold | 300 bp     | 250 bp       | 350 bp       |\n| Notching/one.numr           | 1-6        | 1 less       | 1 more       |\n| Non-retail portfolios       |            |              |              |\n| Relative threshold          | 150%       | 100%         | 200%         |\n| Absolute 12-month threshold | 20 bp      | 15 bp        | 25 bp        |\n| Absolute lifetime threshold | 400 bp     | 350 bp       | 450 bp       |\n| Notching/one.numr           | 1-6        | 1 less       | 1 more       |\n\nThe provisions would have increased by EUR 24m (EUR 34m) in scenario 1 and decreased by EUR 22m (EUR 36m) in scenario 2. For more information on the rating scale and average PDs, see tables 'Rating/scoring information on loans mea- sured at amortised cost' on page 150.\n\nThe provisions are sensitive to rating migration even if the triggers are not reached. The table below shows the impact on provisions from a one notch downgrade of all Nordea's exposures. It includes both the impact of the higher risk for all exposures as well as the impact of transferring exposures from stage 1 to stage 2 that reach the trigger. It also includes the impact of exposures with one rating grade above default going into default, which is estimated at EUR 152m (EUR 139m). This figure is based on calculations with the statistical model rather than individual estimates that would be the case in reality for material defaulted loans.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\n|                                 | 31 Dec 2021            | 31 Dec 2021                        | 31 Dec 2020            | 31 Dec 2020                        |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| EURm                            | Recognised  provisions | Provisions if one  notch downgrade | Recognised  provisions | Provisions if one  notch downgrade |\n| Personal Banking                | 409                    | 532                                | 492                    | 646                                |\n| Business Banking                | 1,148                  | 1,265                              | 1,307                  | 1,447                              |\n| Large Corporates & Institutions | 813                    | 846                                | 874                    | 950                                |\n| Other                           | 34                     | 75                                 | 14                     | 29                                 |\n| Group                           | 2,404                  | 2,718                              | 2,687                  | 3,072                              |",

        "page_content": "## G2. Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## 2.9 Forward looking information\n\nForward-looking information is used for both assessing significant increases in credit risk and calculating expected credit losses. Nordea uses three macroeconomic scenarios: a baseline scenario, a favourable scenario and an adverse scenario. At the end of 2021, the scenarios were weighted into the final expected credit losses (ECL) as follows: baseline 60%, adverse 20% and favourable 20% (baseline 50%, adverse 45% and favourable 5% at the end of December 2020). The consistency in weightings over the past few quarters reflects continued reduced uncertainty regarding the impact of the pandemic, less severe restrictions and the extension of vaccination programmes to include boosters and cover younger people.\n\nThe macroeconomic scenarios are provided by Group Risk in Nordea, based on the Oxford Economics Model. The forecast is a combination of modelling and expert judgement, subject to thorough checks and quality control processes. The model has been built to give a good description of the historical relationships between economic variables and to capture the key linkages between those variables. The forecast period in the model is ten years. For periods beyond, a long-term average is used in the ECL calculations.\n\nThe macroeconomic scenarios reflect Nordea's view of how the Nordic economies will potentially develop following the reopening of societies after COVID-19-related lockdowns. The scenarios take into account the macroeconomic e/ff.ligaects of government and central bank support measures. When developing the scenarios, Nordea took into account projections made by Nordic governments and central banks, Nordea Research and the European Central Bank's macroeconomic forecasts for the euro area.\n\nEconomic projections from the Nordic central banks and the European Central Bank are used as a basis for the baseline scenario. In Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, real GDP has more than recovered from the fall in economic activity caused by the lockdowns of the past two years. Economic prospects are good, although growth is expected to be lower than in recent quarters. Strained global supply chains and bottlenecks are creating headwinds for growth, but these problems are expected to subside as consumption patterns normalise, demand slows and production capacity is adjusted. The spread of COVID-19 has increased again and it is still unclear how serious the economic implications of the new\n\nOmicron variant are. The baseline scenario is that Omicron will not have any major impact on growth.\n\nNordea's two alternative macroeconomic scenarios cover a range of plausible impacts of the pandemic on the Nordic economies, reflecting the persisting uncertainty concerning the pandemic's future evolution and economic e/ff.ligaects.\n\nAt the end of 2021 adjustments to model-based allowances/provisions amounted to EUR 596m, including management judgements. The management judgements cover expected credit losses not yet covered by the IFRS 9 model. The cyclical reserve amounted to EUR 455m at the end of 2021 (EUR 450m) and the reserve covering issues identified in the IFRS 9 model to be later covered in model updates (structural reserve) amounted to EUR 155m (EUR 200m). The cyclical reserve was supported by additional portfolio modelling and was triggered by the substantial uncertainty in the macroeconomic development, as well as the need to account for future rating downgrades potentially underestimated by the IFRS 9 model through the updated macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nThe estimation was supported by the use of the internal stress testing model, adjusted for the impact of government support schemes. For the retail portfolio, the most important public sector actions have been the various forms of labour market support schemes, which have significantly reduced expected defaults and losses among households. Due to the wide scope of these schemes, Nordea decreased the modelled development of new defaults originally predicted by the internal stress testing models, leading to lower predicted loan losses. These models are based on historical observations and correlations. Thus, they do not replicate the impact of the government support schemes launched during the pandemic.\n\nWith regard to the expected rating migration in the corporate portfolio, Nordea took into consideration the positive impact of the various government guarantee and support schemes, primarily addressing the liquidity shock caused by the lockdowns and quarantines. At the same time, additional negative rating migration was assumed for industries a/ff.ligaected by COVID-19. This was based on an updated view of particularly sensitive industries, with the main findings incorporated into the scenario projections.\n\nThe stress test model-based scenario simulations support the loan loss forecasts made by the business areas and help Nordea ensure that its loan loss projections are appropriate.",

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## 2.10 Credit portfolio\n\nIncluding on- and o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures and exposures related to securities and life insurance operations, the total credit risk exposure at year end was EUR 553bn (EUR 557bn in 2020). The total credit exposure according to the Capital Requirements Regulation definition was at year end after Credit Conversion Factor EUR 506bn (EUR 481bn). Credit risk is measured, monitored and segmented in di/ff.ligaerent ways. Onbalance lending consists of amortised cost lending and fair value lending and constitutes the major part of the credit portfolio. Amortised cost lending is the basis for impaired loans, allowances and loan losses.\n\nCredit risk in lending is measured and presented as the principal amount of on-balance-sheet claims, i.e. loans to credit institutions and to the public, and o/ff.liga-balance sheet potential claims on customers and counterparties, net after allowances. Credit risk exposure also includes the risk related to derivative contracts and securities financing. Nordea's loans to the public increased by 4.6% to EUR 345bn during 2021 (EUR 330bn). The corporate portfolio increased approximately 2.7%, while the household portfolio increased by 6.9%. The overall credit quality is solid with strongly rated customers. Close monitoring is performed due to the COVID-19 crisis, but supported by the strong Nordic economies and governmental support, the credit quality remained stable during 2021. Of the lending to the public portfolio, corporate customers accounted for 44.3% (45.1%), household customers for 54.4% (53.2%) and the public sector for 1.3% (1.7%). Loans to central banks and credit institutions, mainly in the form of inter-bank deposits, decreased to EUR 2bn at the end of 2021 (EUR  6bn).\n\n## 2.11 Loans to corporate customers\n\nLoans to corporate customers at the end of 2021 amounted to EUR 153bn (EUR 149bn). The sector that increased the most in 2021 was Consumer discretionary and services, while Industrials decreased the most. The contribution of the three largest industries (Real estate, Financial institutions and Industrials) is approximately 70% of total corporate lending. Real estate remains the largest industry in Nordea's lending portfolio, at EUR 46.5bn (EUR 46.5bn). The real estate (commercial and residential) portfolio predominantly consists of relatively large and financially strong companies, with 94% (93%) of the exposure in rating grades 4- and higher. The distribution of loans to corporate customers by size of loans, seen in the table below, shows a high degree of diversification with approximately 68% (64%) of the corporate volume representing loans up to EUR 50m per customer.\n\n## Loans to corporate customers, by size of loans\n\n|              | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   | 31 Dec 2020   |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Size in EURm | Loans  EURbn  | %             | Loans  EURbn  | %             |\n| 0-10         | 65.5          | 43            | 57.2          | 38            |\n| 11-50        | 37.7          | 25            | 38.9          | 26            |\n| 51-100       | 18.8          | 12            | 22.0          | 15            |\n| 101-250      | 19.6          | 13            | 22.7          | 15            |\n| 251-500      | 5.1           | 3             | 3.8           | 3             |\n| 501-         | 6.0           | 4             | 4.1           | 3             |\n| Total        | 152.7         | 100           | 148.7         | 100           |\n\n## 2.12 Loans to household customers\n\nIn 2021 lending to household customers increased by 6.9% to EUR 188bn (EUR 176bn). The increase was seen in all the Nordic countries, primarily driven by mortgage loans. Mortgage lending increased to EUR 162bn (EUR 151bn) and consumer lending was unchanged at EUR 25bn (EUR 25bn). The proportion of mortgage lending of total household lending remained at 86% (86%).",

The average credit quality was stable in both the corporate and retail portfolios in 2021. Exposure-wise, 34% (17%) of corporate customer exposures migrated upwards while 19% (18%) was down-rated. 89% (88%) of corporate exposures was rated 4or higher, with an average rating for the portfolio of 5-.\n\nInstitutions and retail customers on the other hand show a distribution that is biased towards the higher rating grades. 94% (93%) of retail exposures is scored C- or higher, which indicates a probability of default of 1% or lower. The total e/ff.ligaect on credit risk exposure amount (REA) from migration was an increase of approx. 0.88% during the full year 2021.",

The portfolios with the largest impaired loan amounts were Household, Industrials, Natural resources and Maritime.\n\n## Impaired loans and ratios\n\n|                                                         | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross impaired loans, amort., EURm                      | 3,512  | 3,979  |\n| - of which servicing                                    | 1,641  | 1,788  |\n| - of which non-servicing                                | 1,871  | 2,191  |\n| Impairment rate, (stage 3) gross, bp                    | 128    | 151    |\n| Impairment rate, (stage 3) net, bp                      | 70     | 87     |\n| Allowances in relation to loans,  stages 1 and 2, bp    | 22     | 30     |\n| Total allowance ratio (stages 1, 2 and 3),   bp         | 81     | 93     |\n| Allowances in relation to impaired loans   (stage 3), % | 46     | 42     |\n\n## Risk grade distribution IRB Retail customers/one.numr\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1)  Defaulted loans are not included in the risk grade distribution.\n\n## 2.16 Past due loans\n\nPast due loans, 6 days or more, for corporate customers amounted to EUR 864m, down from EUR 909m one year ago, and past due loans to household totalled EUR 1,440m in 2021, down from EUR 1,543m one year ago.

On balance allowances for 2021 were EUR 2,206m, down from EUR 2,448m in 2020. This was driven by stage 3 releases in Financial institutions and overall in the household portfolio. Of this, stage 1 accounted for EUR 197m (down from EUR 284m one year ago), stage 2 for EUR 399m (down from EUR 490m one year ago) and stage 3 for EUR 1,610m (down from 1,674m in 2020). The coverage ratio was 0.08% for stage 1 (down from 0.12% in 2020), 3.1% for stage 2 (down from 3.5% in 2020) and 46% for stage 3 (up from 42% one year ago). This was driven by a decrease in impaired loans of EUR 467m (12%), while allowances decreased by 4%. The corporate coverage ratio increased from 48% to 50% while it increased from 30% to 36% in the household portfolio.\n\n## 2.18 Net loan losses\n\nNet loan losses for 2021 were low at EUR 118m (EUR 908m), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 4bp for amortised cost loans. Including fair value gains on the Danish mortgage portfolio of EUR 83m, net loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 35m, corresponding to 1bp (26bp). The net loan losses were related to stage 3, whereas there was reversals in stage 1 and 2 during the year reflecting strong credit quality. The individual provisions were coming from a number of industries with some concentration in Oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore as well as Retail trade. EUR 40m of management judgements was released during the year to cover for few individual provisions as well as executed improvements in the IFRS 9 ECL model. The main part of the management judgement reserve of EUR 610m remains in place for expected future losses. Of the net loan losses, EUR 73m relates to corporate customers (EUR 547m) and EUR 41m (EUR 362m) to household customers and EUR 4m (EUR 0m) to the public sector.\n\n## Net loan losses and loan loss ratios\n\n|                                                                                                 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net loan losses, EURm                                                                           |    118 |    908 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, amortised cost, Group, bp                                                  |      4 |     35 |\n| - of which stage 3                                                                              |     12 |     21 |\n| - of which stages 1 & 2                                                                         |     -8 |     14 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, including fair value  mortgage loans, Group, bp/one.numr                   |      1 |     26 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, including fair value  mortgage loans, Personal Banking, bp                 |      1 |     17 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, including fair value  mortgage loans, Business Banking, bp                 |      0 |     34 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, including fair value  mortgage loans, Large Corporates &  Institutions, bp |      2 |     43 |",

Counterparty credit risk\n\nCounterparty credit risk is the risk that Nordea's counterparty to an FX, interest rate, commodity, equity or credit derivative contract defaults prior to the maturity of the contract and that Nordea at that time has a claim on the counterparty. Counterparty credit risk may also exist in repurchase agreements and other securities financing transactions. The current net exposure (after close-out netting and collateral reduction) represents EUR 4.4bn of which 32% was towards financial institutions. For information about financial instruments subject to master netting agreement, see Note G42 'Financial instruments set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet or subject to netting agreements'.\n\n## 4. Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss on Nordea's positions in either the trading book or the non-trading book as a result of changes in market rates and parameters that a/ff.ligaect market values or net interest income flows. Market risk exists irrespective of the accounting treatment of the positions.\n\nThe market risk appetite for the Group is expressed through risk appetite statements issued by the Board of Directors. The statements are defined for trading and banking books.\n\nThe second line of defence ensures that the risk appetite is appropriately translated by the Risk Committee into specific risk appetite limits for the business areas and Group Treasury.\n\nAs part of the overall Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), holistic and bespoke stress tests are used to measure the market\n\nrisk appetite and calibrate limits to monitor and control the full set of material market risk factors to which Nordea is exposed.\n\n## 4.1 Traded market risk\n\nTraded market risk mainly arises from customer-driven trading activities and related hedges in Nordea Markets, which is part of Large Corporates & Institutions.\n\nNordea Markets takes on market risks as part of its business model when o/ff.ligaering corporate and institutional customers a range of fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, commodity and structured products. The market risks to which Nordea Markets is exposed include interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and inflation risk.\n\nFurthermore, Nordea is a major mortgage lender in the Nordic countries and a major market maker in Nordic corporate and government bonds. Holding inventory is necessary to be able to provide secondary market liquidity. As a result, Nordea's business model gives rise to a concentration of Nordic mortgage and corporate bonds as well as local market currencies.\n\n## 4.2 Non-traded market risk\n\nThe non-traded market risks that Nordea is exposed to are interest rate risk, customer behavioural risk, credit spread risk, foreign exchange risk (both structural and non-structural) and equity risk. Non-traded market risk arises from the core",

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\nbanking business of Nordea, related hedges and regulatory or other external requirements (e.g. the liquid asset bu/ff.ligaer).\n\nGroup Treasury is responsible for the risk management of all non-traded market risk exposures on the Group's balance sheet. To ensure a clear division of responsibilities within Group Treasury the banking book risk management is divided across several frameworks - each with a clear risk mandate and specific limits and controls.\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the current or prospective risk to Nordea's capital and/or income arising from adverse movements in interest rates and customer behaviour. Business areas transfer their banking book risk exposures to Group Treasury through an internal funds transfer pricing framework. Market risks are managed centrally and include gap risk, spread risks, basis risks, credit spread risk, behavioural risk and non-linear risks. The e/ff.ligaectiveness of hedging risk exposures from core banking activities, e.g. loans and deposits, may be adversely impacted by the discretion held by customers in respect of their contractual obligations with Nordea.\n\nLiquid assets are managed in accordance with the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer and pledge/collateral frameworks. Most of the directional interest rate risk arising from bond holdings is hedged primarily using maturity-matched IR payer swaps and to a smaller degree overnight indexed payer swaps. Forward rate agreements and listed futures contracts are also used to hedge credit spread and interest rate fixing risks.\n\nThe tail hedging framework comprises a running portfolio of tail hedges across listed equity futures and options, the main credit indices and interest rate swaps and options.\n\n## 4.3 Measurement of market risk\n\nNordea uses several quantitative risk measurement methods for traded market risk: Value-at-risk (VaR), stress testing, sensitivity analysis, parametric methods and Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nVaR is based on historical scenarios and is the primary market risk measurement, complemented by stress testing. Nordea calculates VaR using historical simulation. The current portfolio is revalued based on historical daily changes in market prices, rates and other market risk factors observed during the last 500 business days and translated into changes in current market risk factors. Nordea uses absolute, relative and mixed translation methods for di/ff.ligaerent risk categories. The revaluation of the current portfolio is performed for each position using either a linear approximation method or a full revaluation method, depending on the nature of the position.\n\nParametric methods are used to capture equity event risk including the impact of defaults on equity-related positions (these risks are part of the specific equity risk).\n\nMonte Carlo simulation is used in the incremental risk measure model and the comprehensive risk measure model to capture the default and migration risks.\n\nThe VaR, stressed VaR, equity event risk, incremental risk measure and comprehensive risk measure models were all approved by the Nordea's previous regulator, the Swedish FSA, for use in calculating market risk own funds requirements under the internal model approach (IMA). The same models, with same calibration and settings, as used for regulatory capital requirements are used for internal risk management purposes.\n\nThe standardised approach is applied to risk exposure which is not covered by the IMA. It is used to calculate the market risk exposures for commodity-related products, the specific risk for mortgage and government bonds, commercial papers, credit/rate hybrids and credit spread options. Furthermore, the standardised approach is used to calculate\n\nequity risk related to structured equity and Tier 1 and Tier 2 bonds.\n\nAfter the relocation to Finland in October 2018, Nordea is operating under a temporary tolerance decision from the ECB, what allows Nordea to continue to use its IMA, approved by the Swedish FSA. The ECB's temporary tolerance is conditioned on Nordea applying to the ECB for a new permanent IMA approval. An updated application was submitted in March 2021 and an internal model investigation subsequently conducted by the ECB. The ECB's decision is expected during the first half-year of 2022.\n\nIRRBB is measured, monitored and managed using three key risk metrics:\n\n- \u00b7 Economic value (EV)\n- \u00b7 Fair value (FV)\n- \u00b7 Structural interest income risk (SIIR).\n\nThe three di/ff.ligaerent risk metrics are used to assess di/ff.ligaering aspects of the manifestation of interest rate risk. These are described in more detail below.\n\nEconomic value (EV) of equity stress tests considers the change in the EV of banking book assets, liabilities and interest-bearing derivative exposures resulting from interest rate movements, independent of accounting classification and ignoring credit spreads and commercial margins. The model assumes a run-o/ff.liga balance sheet and includes behavioural modelling for non-maturing deposits and prepayments.\n\nThe earnings risk metric measures the change in net interest income relative to a base scenario, resulting in a structural interest income risk (SIIR) value over a one-year horizon. The model uses a constant balance sheet assumption, implied forward rates and behavioural modelling for non-maturing deposits and prepayments.\n\nThe fair value stress loss (FVSL) risk measure considers the potential revaluation risk relating to positions held under fair value accounting classifications.\n\nFVSL, EV and SIIR sensitivities are measured using internally defined Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) scenarios, the six standardised scenarios defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) as well as a range of parallel and non-parallel shocks. The exposure limit is measured against the worst outcome from the internal scenarios defined under the Risk Appetite Framework (RAF). The RAF scenarios are calibrated to reflect severe but plausible events and are designed to test specific exposures that are, or may be held, under the approved mandate. The scenarios are aligned across the risk types EV, SIIR and FVSL.\n\nThe FV RAF scenarios are applied to both the banking book and the trading book portfolios, and the Board risk appetite limit considers the combined impact across both. The FV stress metric is monitored daily. A range of EV scenarios are estimated daily for management information purposes, but fully calculated and monitored monthly against risk appetite limits. The SIIR earnings metric is monitored monthly.\n\nThe measurement of IRRBB is dependent on key assumptions applied in the models. The most material assumptions relate to the modelling of embedded behavioural options in both assets and liabilities. The behavioural option held by Nordea's lending customers to execute early loan prepayments is estimated using prepayment models. On the liability side, Nordea has a choice to change deposit rates, and customers have a choice to withdraw non-maturing deposits on any given day. Both embedded options are modelled using non-maturing deposit models. Both assumptions are calculated based on the historical average by core asset and liability class features. Assets and liabilities are grouped according",

Regular back-testing and model monitoring are performed for both prepayment models and non-maturing deposit models to ensure that the models remain accurate.\n\nThe Pillar 2 IRRBB capital allocations consist of a fair value risk component and an earnings risk component. The fair value risk component covers the impact on Nordea's equity due to adverse movements in the monthly revaluation of positions accounted for at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The earnings risk component covers the impact of rate changes on the future earnings capacity through modelled impacts to net interest income, and the resulting implications for internal capital bu/ff.ligaer levels.\n\nNordea is exposed to structural FX risk, defined as the mismatch between the currency composition of its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and risk exposure amounts. The CET1 capital is largely denominated in euro with the only significant non-euro equity amounts stemming from mortgage subsidiaries. Therefore, changes in FX rates can negatively impact Nordea's CET1 ratio.\n\n## 4.4 Market risk analysis\n\nThe market risk in Nordea's trading book is presented in the table below.\n\nThe average market risk measured by VaR was EUR 24.7m in 2021 (the average in 2020 was EUR 31.6m) and was primarily driven by interest rate risk. Stressed average VaR was EUR 38.0m in 2021 (the average in 2020 was EUR 46.7m) and primarily driven by interest rate risk with additional contributions from credit spread risk. The peak in VaR was reached in the first quarter while the peak in stressed VaR was reached in the fourth quarter. VaR and stressed VaR are primarily driven by market risk in the Northern European and Nordic countries.\n\nAt the end of 2021 the incremental risk charge (IRC) was slightly lower than at the end of 2020, driven by reduced sovereign bond exposure. The lowest exposure occurred during the fourth quarter of 2021, while the IRC was  highest in the second quarter of 2021. The average IRC decreased marginally compared to the previous year, mainly driven by a lower contribution from the migration component.\n\nAt the end of 2021 the comprehensive risk charge (CRC) was higher than at the end of 2020. The lowest exposure occurred during the second quarter of 2021, while the CRC peaked during the fourth quarter of 2021. The average CRC\n\n## Market risk figures for the trading book/one.numr\n\n| EURm                            |   31 Dec 2021 |   2021 high |   2021 low |   2021 avg |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Total VaR                       |            35 |          46 |         15 |         25 |\n| Interest rate risk              |            37 |          47 |         14 |         26 |\n| Equity risk                     |             3 |          22 |          2 |          5 |\n| Credit spread risk              |             4 |          19 |          3 |         10 |\n| Foreign exchange risk           |             1 |           7 |          1 |          2 |\n| Inflation risk                  |             2 |           4 |          1 |          2 |\n| Diversification e/ff.ligaect    |            24 |          65 |         22 |         45 |\n| Total stressed VaR              |            44 |          72 |         23 |         38 |\n| Incremental risk charge (IRC)   |            17 |          33 |         12 |         20 |\n| Comprehensive risk charge (CRC) |            23 |          37 |         10 |         19 |\n\n## Market risk figures for the banking book\n\n| EURm      |   31 Dec 2021 |   2021 high |   2021 low |   2021 avg |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Total VaR |            69 |         122 |         61 |         88 |\n\n## Market risk figures for the trading book/one.numr\n\n| EURm                            |   31 Dec 2020 |   2020 high |   2020 low |   2020 avg |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Total VaR                       |            17 |          70 |         12 |         32 |\n| Interest rate risk              |            18 |          60 |         12 |         29 |\n| Equity risk                     |             4 |          31 |          1 |          5 |\n| Credit spread risk              |            12 |          54 |          4 |         13 |\n| Foreign exchange risk           |             3 |          11 |          1 |          3 |\n| Inflation risk                  |             3 |           4 |          2 |          3 |\n| Diversification e/ff.ligaect    |            58 |          67 |         25 |         41 |\n| Total stressed VaR              |            40 |          95 |         26 |         47 |\n| Incremental risk charge (IRC)   |            18 |          40 |         12 |         21 |\n| Comprehensive risk charge (CRC) |            18 |         150 |         15 |         39 |\n\n## Market risk figures for the banking book\n\n| EURm      |   31 Dec 2020 |   2020 high |   2020 low |   2020 avg |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Total VaR |            88 |         113 |         32 |         73 |",

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\nfor 2021 decreased by EUR 20.3m compared with 2020 due to the sharp increase at the start of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nTotal VaR in the banking book, which follows IR VaR closely, decreased over the year driven by de-risking in the liquid asset securities portfolio. FX risk in the banking book instead increased driven by a long dollar position that built up over the year, however with limited impact on total VaR due to diversification e/ff.ligaects. The overall banking book market risk remains within Nordea's risk appetite.\n\nThe exposure to long-term illiquid investment holdings was EUR 1,375m at the end of 2021 (EUR 1,268m at the end of 2020), of which:\n\n- \u00b7 private equity funds EUR 604m (EUR 435m)\n- \u00b7 hedge funds EUR 1m (EUR 1m)\n- \u00b7 credit funds EUR 388m (EUR 300m)\n- \u00b7 seed-money investments EUR 199m (EUR 192m)\n- \u00b7 unlisted equity investments EUR 122 (EUR 236m)\n- \u00b7 structured loans EUR 61m (EUR 42m).\n\nAll types of investments, excluding structured loans, are spread over a number of funds.\n\n## 4.5 Structural Interest Income Risk (SIIR)/economic value\n\nAt the end of the year, the worst loss according to the internal RAF scenarios for SIIR was driven by the RAF scenario European Debt Crisis, where the potential reduction during one year in net interest income due to interest rate movements was EUR 214m. Nordea's balance sheet is structured such that net interest income would decrease if short-term interest rates fall. The worst loss out of the internal RAF scenarios for EV risk was EUR 106m.\n\n## 4.6 Other market risks/pension risk\n\nPension risk (including market and longevity risks) arises from Nordea-sponsored defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees. The ability of the pension schemes to meet the projected pension payments is maintained through investments and ongoing scheme contributions.\n\nPension risks can manifest through increases in the value of liabilities or through falls in the values of assets. These risks are regularly reported and monitored and include market risk sub-components such as interest rate, inflation, credit spread, real estate and equity risk. To minimise the risks to Nordea, limits are imposed on potential losses under severe but plausible stress events as well as on capital drawdowns. In addition, regular reviews of the schemes' strategic asset allocation are undertaken to ensure that the investment approach reflects Nordea's risk appetite. See note G34 for more information.\n\n## 5. Operational risk\n\nAt Nordea operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events, and includes legal risk.\n\nOperational risk is inherent in all Nordea's businesses and operations. Managers throughout Nordea are accountable for the operational risks related to their mandate and for managing these risks within the risk limits and risk appetite of the operational risk management framework.\n\nGroup Operational Risk (GOR) within Group Risk constitutes the second line of defence risk control function for operational risk and is responsible for developing and maintaining the overall operational risk management framework as well as for monitoring and controlling the operational risk man-\n\nagement of the first line of defence. GOR is responsible for monitoring and controlling appropriate identification, assessment and mitigation of operational risk and for following up on risk exposures relative to risk appetite and assessing the adequacy and e/ff.ligaectiveness of the operational risk management framework and the implementation of the framework.\n\nThe focus areas of the monitoring and control work performed by GOR are decided during an annual planning process that includes business areas, key risk areas and operational risk processes. GOR is responsible for preparing and submitting regular risk reports on all material risk exposures, including risk appetite limit utilisation and incidents to the Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer (CRO), who reports to the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO) in Group Leadership Team (GLT), the Group Board and the relevant committees.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, and local restrictions, Nordea promoted remote working in 2021 to continue serving customers. Preventive measures taken focused on e.g. awareness communications and training activities, and preventive and compensating controls were put in place to mitigate operational risk related to remote working. In response to the accelerating remote working trend in society, a number of activities supporting the transformation to a hybrid working model post-COVID-19 were initiated.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 crisis presented Nordea with an elevated risk level, this did not materialise as increased operational losses. To address the elevated risk level, the risk appetite loss limit was temporarily increased. The increase was partly but not fully rolled back given the uncertainty still surrounding COVID-19.\n\nThe Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) for operational risk sets out:\n\n- \u00b7 the residual risk level in breach of risk appetite and requirements for mitigating actions for risks\n- \u00b7 the total loss amount from incidents.\n\n## 5.1 Management of operational risk\n\nManagement of operational risk includes all activities aimed at identifying, assessing and measuring, responding to and mitigating, controlling and monitoring as well as reporting on risks. Risk management is supported by various processes and instructions including Risk and Control Self-Assessment, Change Risk Management and Approval, Incident Management, Scenario Analysis, Business Continuity and Crisis Management, Information Security Management, Technology and Data Risk Management, Third Party Risk Management, insurance-related risk diversification and Significant Operating Processes.\n\nSome of these processes are described below and additional details on processes for managing and controlling operational risk are included in the 'Operational and Compliance Risk' section of the Capital and Risk Management Report 2021 published in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation.\n\n## Risk and Control Self-Assessment\n\nThe Risk and Control Self-Assessment process provides an overview and assessment of operational and compliance risks across Nordea. The process improves risk awareness and enables the e/ff.ligaective assessment, control, and mitigation of identified risks. In the Risk and Control Self-Assessment process the level of inherent risk and the controls in place to mitigate the inherent risks are assessed. If mitigating actions are required to reduce the risk exposure, these are identified and implemented.",

        "page_content": "## G2. Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## Change Risk Management and Approval\n\nThe objective of the Change Risk Management and Approval Framework is to ensure that there is a full understanding of both financial and non-financial risks arising from the change, and that risks have been adequately managed consistent with Nordea's risk strategy, risk appetite and corresponding risk limits before a change is approved, executed or implemented.\n\nChanges in scope of the Change Risk Management and Approval Framework include e.g. new or significant changes to products, services, markets, processes and IT systems as well as exceptional transactions and decommissioning.\n\n## Incident Management\n\nThe objective of Incident Management is to ensure appropriate handling and reporting of detected incidents to minimise the impact on Nordea and its customers. Incident Management is designed to prevent reoccurrence and to reduce the probability and impact of future incidents. In addition, Incident Management is to ensure timely notification to defined external bodies and parties, including relevant supervisory authorities.\n\n## Business Continuity and Crisis Management\n\nThe objective of Business Continuity and Crisis Management is the overall risk management under which Nordea ensures building and maintaining the appropriate levels of resiliency, readiness, response and management of extraordinary events and crises. The Business Continuity Plan sets out the procedures to respond, recover, resume and restore operations following an extraordinary event. Crisis Management provides the governance to execute plans and enhance decision-making during a crisis.\n\n## Third Party Risk Management\n\nThe objective of Third Party Risk Management is to ensure that risks related to third parties and third party activities, including but not limited to outsourcing, are appropriately identified, assessed and managed before entering into, during, as well as when exiting a third party arrangement. Third Party Risk Management is to ensure that risks associated with third parties and third party activities are kept within risk appetite and risk limits.\n\n## Information and Communication Technology Risk Management\n\nThe objective of Information and Communication Technology Risk Management is to ensure that information and communication technology and data management risks are appropriately identified, assessed and managed. This also includes the independent validation of risk data aggregation and risk reporting.\n\n## 5.2 Financial reporting risk management\n\nFinancial reporting risk is defined as the risk of misstatements or deficiencies in financial reporting, regulatory reporting and disclosures. An internal control framework for managing financial reporting risk is in place, providing the structure and standards for designing, operating and evaluating the system of internal control over financial reporting across the Group. The framework is the mechanism through which management expresses its various financial statements assertions. Group Risk is the risk control function for financial reporting risk and is responsible for the independent monitoring, assessment and oversight of the risks and the Group's implementation of the framework. Group Risk reports to the Risk Committee and the Board Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.\n\n## 6. Compliance risk\n\nNordea defines compliance risk as the risk of failure to comply with applicable regulations and related internal rules.\n\nEmployees throughout Nordea are accountable for the compliance risks related to their mandate and for managing these risks within risk limits and risk appetite in accordance with the Compliance Risk Management Framework.\n\nGroup Compliance constitutes the independent second line of defence compliance function and is responsible for developing and maintaining the Risk Management Framework for compliance risks and for guiding the business in its implementation of and adherence to the framework.\n\nCompliance activities are presented in the form of an annual compliance plan to the President of Nordea Bank Abp and Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer of the Nordea Group and the Board of Directors. The annual compliance plan provides an overview of Nordea's compliance activities, combining Group Compliance's overall approach to key risk areas. The plan consists of detailed plans for the business areas, the Group functions, the consolidated group subsidiaries, the branches and for each risk area. Group Compliance is responsible for the regular reporting on its plans to the Group Board, the CEO in GLT, branch management and the relevant committees, at least quarterly.\n\nIn 2021 COVID-19 continued to have a considerable impact on society at large. Nordea continued to focus on maintaining service levels to its customers, complying at all times with the government instructions regarding COVID-19. Market volatility persisted due to the pandemic, and Nordea continued to run full-scale risk management capabilities to ensure fair treatment of its customers and integrity in the market. For the major part of the year Nordea employees worked remotely, and Nordea continued to actively monitor the associated risks. More recently, however, Nordea has embarked on a gradual return to the o/ffi.ligace, based on government recommendations in each country. A hybrid working model (a mix of working from the o/ffi.ligace and home) has been implemented, acknowledging the di/ff.ligaerent needs within Nordea units and with due consideration to the impact on processes and customers. To reduce the risks and protect its customers and employees Nordea has taken several actions internally, including guidance for employees, instructions for customer interaction and restrictions on cross-border business travel. Nordea will continue to follow the situation closely and take further actions as needed.\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea's enhancement programme for compliance risk management continued and resulted in various updates to Nordea's Compliance Risk Management Framework. Alongside this, Nordea continued to work on ensuring that Nordea's culture and behaviours are consistent with Nordea's values and that Nordea delivers fair outcomes for its customers throughout the customer lifecycle. Nordea also further developed its Conduct Risk Framework in terms of improved reporting, risk identification and raised awareness. The Compliance, Conduct and Product Committee that oversees the prudent management of compliance and conduct risk continued its work during 2021. The committee focused on key areas such as the management of conflicts of interest in relation to products and services, information to customers as well as further strengthening the processes in relation to product governance and the provision of investment services.\n\nNordea's Code of Conduct defines the high-level principles that guide our business, how we treat our customers and the conduct expected from our employees. It contains our purpose and values and sets the standards for our conduct in areas such as care for the environment, labour rights, how we treat our customers, human rights, the right to privacy, fair",

Compliance with the Code of Conduct is monitored by way of regular reporting to the Chief Compliance O/ffi.ligacer, the Chief Risk O/ffi.ligacer, the CEO and the Board. All employees are required to complete annual Code of Conduct training courses as part of their Licence to Work. 95.98% of all employees (excluding those on long-term leave) completed their Licence to Work during the year.\n\nNordea is committed to conducting business with the highest ethical standards and according to applicable laws, rules and regulations. Nordea's internal controls and operating procedures are designed to detect and prevent misconduct and fraudulent actions.\n\nNordea's whistleblowing function Raise Your Concern (RYC) ensures that all stakeholders, including customers, partners, a/ff.ligaected communities as well as employees, have the right to speak up and always feel safe in doing so if they have concerns about suspected misconduct such as breaches of human rights, or irregularities such as fraudulent, inappropriate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activity or behaviour in our operations, products or services. This includes any action that constitutes a violation of laws or regulations, or of our internal policies, instructions or guidelines. We o/ff.ligaer the possibility to report openly, by providing name and contact details, as all reports are handled with strict confidentiality. However, we also provide an electronic reporting channel, WhistleB, which is managed by an external party. The system is separate from our IT systems and does not track IP addresses or other data that could identify the sender of a message. Reports can be in Danish, English, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish. Cases reported through RYC form part of the monitoring of compliance with the Code of Conduct but are also reported to the Chief People O/ffi.ligacer in addition to being included in management reports and reports to the Board.\n\nNordea is subject to various legal regimes and requirements, including but not limited to those of the Nordic countries, the European Union and the United States. The supervisory and governmental authorities administering and enforcing these regimes make regular enquiries and conduct investigations with regard to Nordea's compliance. Areas subject to investigation include investment advice, anti-money laundering (AML), trade regulation and sanctions adherence, external tax rules, competition law, and governance and control. The outcome and timing of these enquiries and investigations are unclear and pending. Accordingly, it cannot be ruled out that these enquiries and investigations could lead to criticism against the bank, reputation loss, fines, sanctions, disputes and/or litigation.\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces a number of claims related to the provision of banking and investment services and other areas in which it operates. Some of these claims have led or could lead to disputes and/or litigation. Currently, such claims are mainly related to lending and insolvency situations, various investment services, and sub-custody and withholding taxation matters. At present, none of the current claims are considered likely to have any significant adverse e/ff.ligaect on Nordea or its financial position.\n\n## 6.1 ESG-related risk management\n\nNordea continued strengthening its set-up in the ESG area and implemented the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation during 2021 in the savings and investment area. This means that investment funds produced and distributed by the Group were categorised according to their ESG objectives and that disclosure to investors was further developed. In\n\naddition, procedures and governance for investment product and manager selection were strengthened. Investment processes and risk management procedures were further developed to support individual investment decision-making and close monitoring of the individual securities in the investment funds. The investment advice process was strengthened to include customer preference for sustainable investment in the advice given and advisers, key personnel and senior management were instructed and further trained in the area of ESG and sustainable investments.\n\n## 6.2 Financial crime prevention\n\nNordea takes its responsibility to society and its customers seriously and has over the years built strong defences to prevent its products, services and systems from being used for unlawful purposes.\n\nNordea handles and monitors on an annual basis more than 2.8 billion payments and has more than nine million customers. In order to manage such high volumes, Nordea continued to strengthen its financial crime defences in 2021 within the following areas i) IT support of customer due diligence processes, ii) KYC files, iii) transaction monitoring capabilities, iv) Nordea's policies which were updated in light of changes to regulations, v) Nordea's sanctions programme and vi) relevant training to ensure that all employees continue to maintain the right skills and competencies.\n\nNordea's close cooperation with regulators continued during 2021 with ongoing engagement with all four Nordic regulators covering various aspects of Nordea's financial crime programme.\n\nIn June 2015 the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority investigated how Nordea Bank Danmark A/S had followed the regulations regarding AML. The outcome resulted in criticism and, in accordance with Danish administrative practice, the matter was handed over to the police for further handling and possible sanctions. As previously stated, Nordea expects to be fined in Denmark for weak AML processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters.\n\nThere is a risk that, in the event the authorities issue fines, these could be higher (or potentially lower) than the current provision, and this could also impact Nordea's financial performance. In addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation. Given this uncertainty, Nordea will maintain a su/ffi.ligacient level of provision for ongoing AML-related matters while continuing the dialogue with the Danish Authorities regarding their allegations concerning historical AML weaknesses.\n\nNordea has made significant investments to address the deficiencies highlighted by the investigations. Among other actions, Nordea established in 2015 the Financial Crime Change Programme, and has strengthened its organisation significantly to enhance its AML and sanction management risk frameworks.\n\n## 6.3 Management of compliance risk\n\nThe Risk Appetite Statement for compliance risk gives direction on compliance risk management and defines the residual risk levels, at which risk appetite would be breached and formulates requirements for mitigation of compliance risk.\n\nDetails on key processes for managing and controlling compliance risks are included in the 'Operational and Compliance Risk' section of the Capital and Risk Management Report 2021 published in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation.\n\n## 7. Life insurance risk and market risks in the Life & Pension operations\n\nThe life insurance business of Life & Pension consists of a range of di/ff.ligaerent life and health products, from endowments",

Market return products (unit-linked products) clearly dominate the business, whereas traditional products (participating savings and life insurance products) and health insurance only account for a minor share.\n\nThe main risks of Life & Pension are market risks and life and health insurance risks.\n\nMarket risks at Life & Pension arise from the sensitivity of the values of assets and liabilities to changes in the level or volatility of market prices or interest rates. Within market risk, interest rate risk, equity risk, credit spread risk are the most relevant risks. Life & Pension also recognises that sustainability risk is an emerging risk that will primarily materialise as market risk, i.e. through changes in the market values of its investments.\n\nMarket risk is measured and monitored by calculating the exposure and setting adequate limits. In addition, Life & Pension regularly performs stress tests and macroeconomic scenario analyses to assess the need for future capitalisation. The results of the stress tests and scenario analyses are monitored against limits specified in the internal policies.\n\nMarket risk is mitigated by applying hedging and asset allocation strategies.\n\nLife and health insurance risk is the risk of unexpected losses due to changes in the level, trend or volatility of mortality, longevity, disability and surrender/ lapse rates. The risk is measured and monitored by calculating the Solvency II capital requirements. To assess the resilience of the business to sudden changes in the lapse rate, regular sensitivity tests are performed by Life & Pension and at local entity level. Life and health insurance risk is mitigated using actuarial methods, i.e. through tari/ff.ligas, rules for acceptance of customers, reinsurance contracts, stress tests and setting up adequate provisions for risks.\n\n## 8. Liquidity risk management\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea continued to benefit from its prudent liquidity risk management, in terms of maintaining a diversified and strong funding base and a diversified liquidity bu/ff.ligaer. Nordea maintained a strong liquidity position throughout the year.\n\nNordea issued approximately EUR 21.3bn in long-term funding in 2021 (excluding Danish covered bonds), of which approximately EUR 7.6bn was issued in the form of covered bonds and EUR 13.7bn as senior debt.\n\nThroughout 2021 Nordea remained compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement in all currencies on a combined basis, as well as the net stable funding ratio (NFSR).\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea participated in the ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). To date, Nordea has borrowed EUR 12bn under the TLTRO III programme. The ECB applies a negative interest rate to the TLTRO III funding. Nordea accordingly recognised the negative interest expense in connection with its TLTRO III borrowing. In 2021 the negative interest expense added EUR 95m (EUR 19m) to Nordea's net interest income. If Nordea's eligible lending reached a certain threshold, measured at the end of the first quarter of 2021 and the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the interest rate would decrease to -1% with retroactive impact. Nordea changes the e/ff.ligaective interest rate in accordance with IFRS 9 if the threshold is reached and recognises the impact under net interest income. In 2021 Nordea reached the lending threshold at the end of the first quarter and altered the e/ff.ligaective interest\n\nrate with retroactive impact. Nordea did not change the e/ff.ligaective interest rate for the third and fourth quarters, as it could not yet be concluded with adequate certainty that the threshold at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 had been reached.\n\n## 8.1 Liquidity risk definition and identification\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Nordea is unable to service its cash flow obligations when they fall due; or unable to meet its cash flow obligations without incurring significant additional funding costs. Nordea is exposed to liquidity risk in its lending, investments, funding, o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures and other activities which result in a negative cash flow mismatch. Cash flow mismatches can occur at the end of a day or intraday.\n\n## 8.2 Management principles and control\n\nLiquidity risk at Nordea is managed across three lines of defence:\n\nThe first line of defence consists of Group Treasury and the business areas. Group Treasury is responsible for the day-today management of the Group's liquidity positions, liquidity bu/ff.ligaers, external and internal funding including the mobilisation of cash across the Group, and funds transfer pricing.\n\nThe second line of defence, Group Risk, is responsible for providing independent oversight of and challenge to the first line of defence.\n\nThe third line of defence includes Group Internal Audit (GIA), which is responsible for providing independent oversight of the first and second lines of defence.\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the liquidity risk appetite by setting limits for the liquidity risk metrics applied. The most central metric is the liquidity stress horizon, which defines the risk appetite by setting a minimum survival period of 90 days under institution-specific and market-wide stress scenarios with limited mitigation actions.\n\nA framework of limits and monitoring metrics is in place to ensure that Nordea stays within various risk parameters including its risk appetite.\n\nA funds transfer pricing (FTP) framework is in place which takes into account that liquidity is a scarce and costly resource. By quantifying and allocating liquidity and funding costs and benefits to the respective business areas, behaviours and strategic decisions are appropriately incentivised.\n\n## 8.3 Liquidity risk management strategy\n\nNordea's liquidity risk management strategy is based on policy statements resulting in various liquidity risk measures, limits and organisational procedures.\n\nAccording to its policy statements, Nordea's attitude to liquidity risk management is conservative. Nordea strives to diversify its sources of funding and seeks to establish and maintain relationships with investors in order to ensure market access. A broad and diversified funding structure is reflected by the strong presence in the Group's four domestic markets in the form of a strong and stable retail customer base and a variety of funding programmes. The funding consists of both short-term (US and European commercial paper as well as certificates of deposits) and long-term (covered bonds, European medium-term notes and medium-term notes) programmes and covers a range of currencies.\n\nTrust is fundamental in the funding market. Therefore Nordea periodically publishes information on the Group's liquidity situation. Furthermore, Nordea regularly performs stress testing of its liquidity risk position to capture relevant risk drivers, and has put business contingency plans in place for liquidity crisis management.",

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## 8.4 Liquidity risk measurement\n\nTo ensure funding in situations where Nordea is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not su/ffi.ligace, Nordea holds a liquidity bu/ff.ligaer. The liquidity bu/ff.ligaer consists of central bank eligible, high credit quality and liquid securities as well as central bank cash that can be readily sold or used as collateral in funding operations.\n\nLiquidity risk management focuses on both short-term liquidity risk and long-term structural liquidity risk. Liquidity risk is limited by the Board of Directors via the liquidity stress coverage ratio and liquidity stress horizon metrics stipulating that the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer needs to be su/ffi.ligacient to cover peak cumulative stressed outflows experienced over the first 90 days of a combined stress event, whereby Nordea is subject to market-wide stress similar to that experienced by many banks in 2007-08 as well as idiosyncratic stress corresponding to a three-notch credit rating downgrade. These metrics form the basis for Nordea's liquidity risk appetite, which is reviewed and approved by the Board at least annually.\n\nFurthermore, short-term funding risk is measured via the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and a funding gap risk metric. The funding gap risk metric expresses the expected maximum accumulated need for raising liquidity in the course of the next 30 days. Funding gap risk is measured and limited for each currency and as a total figure for all currencies combined.\n\nNordea's structural liquidity risk is measured by many metrics of which the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) and the internally defined net balance of stable funding are very important. Furthermore, the loan to deposit ratio is closely monitored together with the wholesale funding refinancing profile and rating agency metrics.\n\n## 8.5 Liquidity risk analysis\n\nNordea continues to have a strong and prudent liquidity risk profile with a strong funding base. As of year-end 2021, the total volume utilised under CD and CP programmes was EUR 38.2bn (EUR 33.7bn) with an average maturity of 0.4 (0.4) years. The total volume under long-term programmes was EUR 144.3bn (EUR 147.6bn) with an average maturity of 7.3 (6.8) years. Nordea's funding sources are presented in the table below.\n\nThe liquidity risk position remained at a low level throughout 2021. The liquidity stress horizon was 1,095 days as of year-end 2021 (530 days as of year-end 2020) with an annual average of 753 days (671 days) - the Group limit is not below 90 days.\n\nThe annual average of the funding gap risk was EUR +44.9bn (EUR +35.8bn in 2020) against a limit of EUR -15bn. Nordea's liquidity bu/ff.ligaer ranged between EUR 92.1bn and 145.2bn throughout 2021 (EUR 88.3bn and EUR 129.8bn) with an average liquidity bu/ff.ligaer of EUR 122.8bn (EUR 103.7bn).\n\nThe combined LCR according to the EBA Delegated Act rules for the Nordea Group was 160% at the end of 2021 (158%) with an annual average of 152% (166%). At the end of 2021 the LCR in EUR was 143% (278%) and in USD 169% (119%), with annual averages of 228% (209%) and 174% (199%), respectively. At the end of 2021 Nordea's NSFR was 111.1% (110.3%).\n\n## Funding sources, 31 December 2021\n\n| Liability type                                       | Interest   rate base            | Average  maturity  (years)   | EURm    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Deposits by credit institutions                      | Deposits by credit institutions |                              |         |\n| Shorter than 3 months                                | Euribor, etc.                   | 0.1                          | 13,518  |\n| Longer than 3 months                                 | Euribor, etc.                   | 1.7                          | 13,444  |\n| Deposits and borrowings   from the public            |                                 |                              |         |\n| Deposits on demand                                   | Administrative                  | 0.0                          | 188,595 |\n| Other deposits                                       | Euribor, etc.                   | 1.1                          | 17,206  |\n| Debt securities in issue                             |                                 |                              |         |\n| Certificates of deposits                             | Euribor, etc.                   | 0.4                          | 26,863  |\n| Commercial papers                                    | Euribor, etc.                   | 0.3                          | 11,336  |\n| Mortgage covered bond loans                          | Fixed rate,  market-based       | 8.4                          | 111,159 |\n| Other bond loans                                     | Fixed rate,  market-based       | 2.9                          | 26,434  |\n| Derivatives                                          |                                 |                              | 31,485  |\n| Other non-interest-  bearing items                   |                                 |                              | 70,496  |\n| Subordinated debt                                    |                                 |                              |         |\n| Tier 2 subordinated   bond loans                     | Fixed rate,  market-based       | 7.3                          | 4,826   |\n| Additional Tier 1 subordinated  bond loans (undated) | Fixed rate,  market-based       |                              | 1,893   |\n| Equity                                               |                                 |                              | 33,503  |\n| Total                                                |                                 |                              | 550,758 |\n| Liabilities to policyholders                         |                                 |                              | 19,595  |\n| Total, including   life insurance operations         |                                 |                              | 570,353 |\n\n## Net stable funding ratio\n\n| EURbn                              | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Available stable funding           | 311.8         | 305.8         |\n| Required stable funding            | 280.5         | 277.2         |\n| Net stable funding                 | 31.2          | 28.6          |\n| Net stable funding ratio /one.numr | 111.1%        | 110.3%        |\n\n1)  According to CRR2 regulation.",

Segment reporting\n\n## Operating segments\n\n## Measurement of operating segments' performance\n\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), as required by IFRS 8. At Nordea the CODM has been defined as the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer (CEO), who is supported by the other members of the Group Leadership Team.\n\nThe main di/ff.ligaerence between the segment reporting in Note G3 and 'Business areas' presented elsewhere in this report is that the information in Note G3 follows the reporting to the CODM prepared using plan exchange rates, while the reporting under 'Business areas' is prepared using actual FX rates. Nordea applies the use of static planning rates in order to avoid currency raterelated fluctuations in the reporting to the CODM. The same exchange rates (e.g. SEK, NOK, RUB vs EUR) are used for the current and comparable year. The planning rates used are set during December the preceding year and calculated as the average spot rates the first five banking days in December the preceding year. The comparatives are annually restated to reflect the plan exchange rates for the current period as reflected in the internal reporting used by the CODM.\n\n## Basis of segmentation\n\nNordea's main business areas, Personal Banking, Business Banking, Large Corporates & Institutions and Asset & Wealth Management, are identified as operating segments and reported separately as they are operating segments exceeding the quantitative thresholds in IFRS 8. Other operating segments below the thresholds are included in Other operating segments. Group functions\n\n(and eliminations) as well as the result that is not fully allocated to any of the operating segments are shown separately as reconciling items.\n\nThere have been no changes in the basis of segmentation during the year.\n\n## Reportable segments\n\nPersonal Banking serves Nordea's household customers. Personal Banking o/ff.ligaers customers a full range of financial services that fulfil the customers' day-to-day financial needs. Personal Banking serves our customers through the netbank, the mobile bank, over the phone, via online meetings and at Nordea's branch o/ffi.ligaces. The business area includes advisory and service sta/ff.liga, channels and product units under a common strategy, operating model and governance across markets.\n\nBusiness Banking serves, advises and partners with corporate customers, covering all their business needs through a full range of services, including payments, cash management, cards, working capital management and finance solutions. Business Banking also provides services such as payments, cards and finance solutions to personal customers.\n\nLarge Corporates & Institutions provides financial solutions to large Nordic and international corporates and/uni00A0institutional customers.

Benefits are included at taxable values after salary deductions (if any).\n\nThe pension expense is related to pension premiums paid under defined contribution plans (DCP) and pension rights earned during the year under defined benefit plans (DBP) (current service cost and past service cost and settlements as defined in IAS 19).\n\nEUR 1,901,643 (EUR 2,309,931) of the total pension expense relates to DCPs, corresponding to 96.6% (98.0%).\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nThe EIP 2021 for the GLT is based on specific goals and targets and is capped at maximum 75% of the fixed base salary. 40% of the EIP 2021 outcome will be paid out in 2022. The remaining 60% will be paid annually on a pro rata basis over five years with 12% vesting each year. 50% of the EIP 2021 outcome is delivered in Nordea shares (excluding dividends) at each transfer event.

The CEO is paid severance pay equal to 12 months' salary, to be reduced by any salary received from other employment during these 12 months.\n\nThe Deputy Managing Director and ten GLT members have a notice period of 6 months and Nordea a notice period of 12 months. Severance pay of up to 12 months' salary is provided and will be reduced by any salary received from other employment during the severance pay period.\n\nNo severance pay commitment was agreed with members of the GLT in 2020 or 2021.\n\nPayments to the former CEO and other former members of the GLT amounted to EUR 1,493,434 in 2021, in full covered by provisions recognised in 2019.\n\n## Indemnification\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken to indemnify the members of the GLT against legal expenses incurred in relation to legal advice in defending or disputing certain claims or investigations by third parties, excluding crimes or actions made with intent or gross negligence. For each GLT member, the indemnity is capped at an aggregate amount of EUR 37.5m, unless the Board decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis. Nordea purchases D&O insurance which provides cover for liability assumed by the bank following the indemnification undertaking.\n\n## Loans to and deposits from key management personnel\n\nLoans to key management personnel (defined in section 28 of Note G1) amounted to EUR 3m (EUR 3m) and interest income on these loans amounted to EUR 0m (EUR 0m). Deposits from key management personnel amounted to EUR 12m (EUR 14m) and interest on these deposit amounted to EUR 0m (EUR 0m). Loan commitments to key management personnel amounted to EUR 0m (EUR 0m).\n\nFor key management personnel employed by Nordea the same credit terms apply as for other employees. In Finland the employee interest rate for loans corresponds to Nordea's funding cost with a margin of 30bp. In Denmark the employee interest rate for loans is variable and was 2.25% at 31 December 2021, but special terms are applied for car loans and mortgage loans. The interest rate on car loans without collateral is variable and was 1.50%. The interest rate on mortgage loans up to 80% of the valuation of the property\n\nwas 1.50%. In Norway the variable interest rate on loans for employees was 1.40% at 31 December 2021. Mortgage loans with fixed interest rates are o/ff.ligaered with the same rates as mortgage loans to Premium customers. In Sweden the employee interest rate on fixed and variable interest rate loans is 215bp lower than the corresponding interest rate for external customers (with a lower limit of 50bp). There is currently a cap of 57 Swedish price base amounts both on fixed and variable interest rate loans. For interest on loans above the defined cap, the same terms apply as for Premium customers. Loans to family members of key management personnel are granted on normal market terms, as are loans to key management personnel who are not employed by Nordea.\n\n## Share-based transactions\n\nNordea has several variable pay programmes for selected Nordea employees (participants). The terms of the programmes vary depending on the target group. Disclosures related to the share-based programmes can be found below. All remuneration programmes are also described in the section 'Remuneration' on page 83 of the Board of Directors' report and in further detail below.\n\nIn 2020 Nordea introduced a new Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for GLT members, which is an equity-settled plan. For more information on this plan, see 'Long Term Incentive Plan 2020-2022' below.\n\nIn 2021 Nordea decided to continue the share-based Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) implemented in 2020 for a new performance period 2021-2023. It includes the GLT members and a maximum of 50 additional senior leaders. For more information on this plan, see 'Long Term Incentive Plan 20212023' below.\n\nUntil the end of the performance year 2018, Nordea's share-based variable pay programmes were partly in the form of cash-linked total shareholder return (TSR) indexation (excluding dividends) and partly in the form of cash. The programmes were consequently all settled in cash and the portion indexed with Nordea's TSR was accounted for as a cashsettled share-based payment programme. The TSR indexation resulted in the expense of EUR 16m in 2021. Starting from the 2019 performance year, share-based variable pay programmes are partly in the form of cash and partly in the form of Nordea shares, which makes the portion paid in Nordea shares an equity-settled share-based programme. TSR indexation may be used for share-based variable pay programmes,\n\n## Share-based transactions\n\n| Programme year   | Equity settled   or cash settled   | Delivery period   | Expense 2021   | Expense 2020   | Liability  31 Dec 2021   | Liability  31 Dec 2020   | Outstanding  rights   |\n|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 2021             |                                    |                   |                |                |                          |                          |                       |\n| - LTIP           | Equity settled                     | 2024-2029         | 1              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes 1                 |\n| - EIP            | Equity settled                     | 2022-2027         | 16             | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes 2                 |\n| - VSP and Bonus  | Equity settled                     | 2022-2027         | -              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes 2                 |\n| - Buy-outs etc.  | Equity settled                     | 2022-2023         | -              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| 2020             |                                    |                   |                |                |                          |                          |                       |\n| - LTIP           | Equity settled                     | 2023-2028         | 0              | 0              | -                        | -                        | Yes/three.numr        |\n| - EIP            | Equity settled                     | 2021-2026         | -5             | 14             | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| - VSP and Bonus  | Equity settled                     | 2021-2026         | 7              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| - Buy-outs etc.  | Equity settled                     | 2021-2026         | -              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| Previous years   | Cash settled                       | 2022-2025         | 16             | -4             | 24                       | 32                       | No                    |\n|                  | Equity settled                     | 2022-2025         | -1             | -8             | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| Total            |                                    |                   | 34             | 2              | 24                       | 32                       |                       |\n\n- 1)  Rights will be granted following the end of the three-year performance period (2021-2023) over the delivery period (2024-2029).\n- 2)  Rights will be granted in 2022 based on the performance in 2021.\n- 3)  Rights will be granted following the end of the 3-year performance period (2020-2022) over the delivery period (2023-2028).",

In 2021 these were adjusted to EUR 12m for the portion delivered in shares and another EUR 3m were converted to cash. In 2021 1,780,627 shares in Nordea were allotted to the participants in these programmes, corresponding to EUR 15m based on the share price at the award date. Another 1,646,791 shares were granted to the participants but deferred. These deferred shares had a fair value of EUR 14m based on the share price at the award date.\n\nThe table above covers all programmes with share-based programme expenses recognised in 2021, as well as the comparative figures for 2020. Figures for 2021 are based on the expected 2021 outcome and all figures are excluding social security expenses. The expense for 2021 is based on an assumption about the number of shares that will be granted and deferred for delivery in later years.\n\n## Long Term Incentive Plan 2020-2022\n\nThe Nordea Board decided on 11 June 2020 to launch a new LTIP for the CEO and eight other members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT) for a three-year performance period, from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. The plan delivers conditional share awards, i.e. a promise to deliver shares if certain conditions are met.\n\nThe maximum number of shares allocated to the participants was decided when the plan was launched and the final number of shares to be awarded to each participant will be determined in the second quarter 2023. The assessment of performance during the LTIP performance period will be based equally on the following performance criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 absolute total shareholder return (aTSR)\n- \u00b7 relative total shareholder return (rTSR)\n- \u00b7 cumulative earnings per share (EPS).\n\n|                             | LTIP 2020-2022                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Service condition           | Employed within the Nordea Group during the  3-8-year vesting period.                            |\n| Performance  condition aTSR | Absolute growth in the Nordea share price (with  dividends reinvested).                          |\n| Performance  condition rTSR | Growth in the Nordea share price (with dividends  reinvested) compared to a group of nine peers. |\n| Performance  condition EPS  | Total earnings per share for the period 2021-2022.

The remaining 60% will be\n\ndelivered annually in five equal portions during the second quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2028 if the participants are still employed in Nordea. All delivered shares are subject to a 12-month retention period, where the participant cannot access or sell the shares. Unvested shares will not be delivered if the employment is terminated before the award payment, however, subject to local regulations and leaver provisions, unless the criteria for a 'good leaver' is fulfilled.\n\nIf the financial circumstances of Nordea deteriorate or if the participant breaches internal policies, the awards to be given can be reduced or cancelled. There is also the possibility of clawbacks of deferred shares in similar situations.

All delivered shares are subject to a 12-month retention period, where the participant cannot access or sell the shares. Unvested shares will not be delivered if the employment is terminated before the award payment, however, subject to local regulations and leaver provisions, unless the criteria for a 'good leaver' is fulfilled.\n\nIf the financial circumstances of Nordea deteriorate or if the participant breaches internal policies, the awards to be given can be reduced or cancelled. There is also the possibility of clawbacks of deferred shares in similar situations. These conditions do not a/ff.ligaect the assessment that the grant date is\n\n31 March 2021 as the likelihood is low and all participants are aware of these conditions from the start.\n\n## General conditions\n\n|                                           | LTIP 2021-2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Ordinary share per right                  | 1.0              |\n| Grant date                                | 31 March 2021    |\n| Vesting period                            | 3-8 years        |\n| Contractual life                          | 8 years          |\n| First day of access for the first portion | Q2 2025          |\n\n## Fair value at grant date\n\n|                            | Vesting date   | Vesting date   | Vesting date   | Vesting date   | Vesting date   | Vesting date   |\n|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                            | Q2 2024        | Q2 2025        | Q2 2026        | Q2 2027        | Q2 2028        | Q2 2029        |\n| Maximum  number of  shares | 586,000        | 175,800        | 175,800        | 175,800        | 175,800        | 175,800        |\n| Award life,  years         | 3              | 4              | 5              | 6              | 7              | 8              |\n| aTSR                       | 2.90           | 2.77           | 2.64           | 2.52           | 2.41           | 2.30           |\n| rTSR                       | 2.38           | 2.27           | 2.16           | 2.06           | 1.97           | 1.88           |\n| EPS                        | 6.45           | 6.16           | 5.89           | 5.62           | 5.37           | 5.13           |\n\nThe fair values of the rights are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation (rTSR and aTSR) and Black & Scholes formula (EPS) using the following parameters:\n\n| Weighted average share price at grant date, EUR   | 8.41      |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Exercise price, EUR                               | -         |\n| Expected volatility                               | 31.3%     |\n| Award life                                        | See above |\n| Expected dividends                                | 4.6%      |\n| Risk-free interest rate                           | 0.0%      |\n\nThe expected volatility is based on Nordea's historical daily share price volatility over a historical period of three years.\n\n| Conditional rights LTIP 2021-2023   | aTSR    | rTSR    | EPS     |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                                     | 2021    | 2021    | 2021    |\n| Granted                             | 488,333 | 488,333 | 488,333 |\n| Forfeited                           | -       | -       | -       |\n| Outstanding at the end of the year  | 488,333 | 488,333 | 488,333 |\n| - of which currently exercisable    | -       | -       | -       |\n\n## Expired Long Term Incentive Programmes - 2012\n\nThe LTIP 2012 was fully expensed in May 2015.

Sta/ff.liga costs, cont.\n\n## Share-based variable remuneration programmes other than LTIP programmes\n\nThis section covers the variable share-based programmes where the instruments TSR indexation (cash-settled programme up until 2018) and shares (equity-settled programme as from 2019) are used for deferral/retention. The programmes are classified as: the Executive Incentive Programme (EIP), Variable Salary Part (VSP) and Bonus schemes.\n\nThe programmes are annual plans with a service condition for the respective years and are fully expensed in the year when they are earned (one-year vesting period). The individual allocations are awarded at the beginning of the subsequent year.\n\nIn 2021, participation in the EIP programme was o/ff.ligaered to up to approx. 300 selected people leaders and key employees within the Nordea Group, including members of the GLT. Nordea introduced the EIP in 2013. The aim of the EIP is to strengthen Nordea's capability to recruit, motivate and retain selected people leaders and key employees outside of the GLT, as well as reward strong performance. The aim is also to further stimulate these people whose e/ff.ligaorts have a direct impact on Nordea's results, profitability and long-term value growth. EIP 2021 rewards performance meeting agreed predetermined targets on Group, business unit and individual level. The e/ff.ligaect on the long-term results is to be considered when determining the targets. EIP awards will not exceed the fixed salary and are subject to deferral for all participants, and for material risk takers forfeiture clauses and retention apply in line with relevant remuneration regulations.\n\nVariable Salary Part (VSP) is generally capped at 50% of fixed remuneration and o/ff.ligaered to selected positions where variable remuneration is widespread market practice. VSP aims to reward strong performance and e/ff.ligaorts. The assessment of individual performance is based on a predetermined set of well-defined financial as well as non-financial goals. Awards from VSP will not exceed the annual fixed salary and are paid in cash. For material risk takers, VSP awards are partly delivered in shares with subsequent retention. Parts of the awards for material risk takers in VSP are subject to at least a four-year pro rata deferral period with forfeiture conditions applying during the deferral period.\n\nIn 2021, bonus schemes were o/ff.ligaered only to selected groups of employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board, e.g. in Large Corporates & Institutions, Nordea Asset Management, in Nordea Funds and within Treasury in Group Finance. The aim is to ensure strong performance and maintain cost flexibility for Nordea. Individual awards are determined based on detailed performance assessments covering a range of financial and non-financial goals. 2021 bonus awards from bonus schemes are paid in cash. For material risk takers, awards are partly delivered in shares with subsequent retention. Parts of the awards for material risk takers in a bonus scheme are subject to a four-to five-year pro rata deferral period with forfeiture conditions applying during the deferral period.\n\nDeferrals from the EIP (including the EIP for GLT), VSP and bonus programmes not yet delivered to the participants as of 31 December 2021 are summarised in the following tables,\n\nincluding deferrals from the LTV programme (o/ff.ligaered in 2018-2019) and deferrals stemming from compensation for contracts in previous employments (buy-outs). Such agreements can be o/ff.ligaered only in exceptional cases, in the context of hiring new sta/ff.liga, limited to the first year of employment.\n\nThe table below shows the remaining liabilities for the cash-settled share-based programmes used 2014-2018.\n\n## 2014-2018 share-linked deferrals (cash-settled)\n\n| EURm                            |   2021 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Opening balance                 |     32 |     74 |\n| Deferred/earned during the year |      1 |      1 |\n| TSR indexation during the year  |     16 |     -4 |\n| Payments during the year        |    -25 |    -37 |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences   |      0 |     -2 |\n| Closing balance                 |     24 |     32 |\n\nThe closing balances are expected to be settled the following years:\n\n| EURm   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| 2021   | -      | 17     |\n| 2022   | 17     | 9      |\n| 2023   | 3      | 3      |\n| 2024   | 3      | 3      |\n| 2025   | 1      | 0      |\n| 2026   | 0      | 0      |\n| 2027   | 0      | -      |\n| Total  | 24     | 32     |\n\nStarting from the 2019 performance year, share-based variable pay programmes are partly in the form of cash and partly in the form of Nordea shares, which makes the portion paid in Nordea shares an equity-settled share-based programme. The granting of shares in the programmes for 2021 is decided during spring 2022 and thus not included in the below tables, but in full recognised as an expense in the income statement in 2021. A provision of EUR 17m excl. social costs is made in 2021 for the portion to be paid in cash. EUR 16m was in addition recognised as an expense for the equity-settled sharebased 2021 programme in the income statement and as an increase of equity.\n\nDeferred awards with initial grant value EUR 1m earned before 1 Oct 2020 were carried over from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale as part of acquisition of SG Finans A/S and replaced with similar instruments linked to Nordea share price. Fair value of these awards was EUR 1m at conversion period during Q1 2021. Of these awards EUR 0m were cash-based and EUR 1m is indexed to share price. EUR 0m of awards were paid according to the original vesting schedule during 2021. Fair value of the remaining liability is EUR 1m and is fully linked to Nordea share price as of 31 December 2021. The liability will mature during 2022-2024. These awards are not included in 2021 figures presented in the above tables.",

The recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is based on an assessment of the probability and amount of future taxable profits as well as on future reversals of existing taxable temporary di/ff.ligaerences.\n\nAdditionally, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of EUR 1m (EUR 3m) in relation to tax loss carry forwards in various entities as well as EUR 560m (EUR 375m) in relation to unused foreign tax credits. Unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses may be recovered in the event of extraordinary taxable income arising in the relevant entities. Unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to foreign tax credits may be recovered in the event of unexpected di/ff.ligaerences in the timing of taxation or the tax base between the head o/ffi.ligace and branches.\n\n## G13.

Nordea may take positions with the expectation of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates or indices. The trading portfolio is treated as trading risk for risk management purposes.

Derivatives set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet are in this note presented as a reduction in derivatives held for the same purpose, i.e. derivatives used for the purpose of hedge accounting are set o/ff.liga against other derivatives used for hedge accounting and derivatives not used for hedge accounting are set o/ff.liga against other derivatives not used for hedge accounting.\n\nThe table below shows the fair value of derivative financial instruments together with their notional amounts.

Derivatives and hedge accounting, cont.\n\n## Risk management\n\nNordea manages its identified market risks according to the risk management framework and strategy described in section 4 'Market risk' in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nNordea classifies its exposures to market risk into either trading (the trading book) or non-trading (the banking book) portfolios that are managed separately.\n\nThe trading book consists of all positions in financial instruments held by Nordea either with trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent. Positions held with trading intent are those held intentionally for shortterm resale or with the intention of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price di/ff.ligaerences between buying and selling prices or from other price or interest rate variations.\n\nThe banking book comprises all positions not held in the trading book. All hedges qualifying for hedge accounting are treated as banking book instruments. The hedging instruments and risks hedged are further described below by risk and hedge accounting type.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nNordea's primary business model is to collect deposits and use these funds to provide loans and other funding products and debt instruments to its customers. Interest rate risk is the impact that changes in interest rates could have on Nordea's margins, profit or loss and equity. Interest rate risk arises from mismatches between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nAs part of Nordea's risk management strategy, the Board has established limits on the non-trading interest rate gaps for interest rate sensitivities. These limits are consistent with Nordea's risk appetite and Nordea aligns its hedge accounting objectives to keep exposures within those limits. Nordea's policy is to monitor positions on a daily basis. For further information on measurement of risks, see section 4 'Market risk' in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nFor hedge accounting relationships related to interest rate risk, the hedged risk is the change in the fair value of the hedged item due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The hedge ratio is established by matching the notional of the derivatives against the principal of the hedged items.\n\nIn order to hedge and manage the risk and limit the impact on Nordea's margins, profit or loss and equity, Nordea uses hedging instruments to swap interest rate exposures into either fixed or variable rates.\n\nThe risk components of hedged items designated by the Group consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, i.e. IBORs which also include new alternative  reference rates (ARR) such as SOFR, ESTR or SONIA. Using the benchmark interest rate risk can result in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship.\n- \u00b7 Components of cashflows of hedged items.\n\nThe benchmark rate is determined as a change in the present value of the future cash flows using benchmark discount curves. The benchmark rate is separately identifiable and reliably measurable and is typically the most significant component of the overall change in fair value or cash flows.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nNordea enters into interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps in order to reduce or eliminate changes in the fair value of the hedged items due to interest rate risk.\n\nHedged items are fixed rate financial assets and liabilities in both local and foreign currencies such as loans, FVOCI debt securities, deposits and debt securities in issue.\n\nHedging instruments are interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps (the portion related to interest rate risk is designated in fair value hedge relationships).\n\nNordea applies fair value hedge accounting both at micro level at which one hedged item is hedged using one or several hedging instruments and at portfolio level where groups of items are hedged using multiple hedging instruments. Nordea applies fair value hedge accounting at micro level for hedging fixed-rate FVOCI debt securities and fixed-rate debt securities in issue.\n\nPortfolio fair value hedge accounting is applied for hedging loans and deposits, where fixed-rate loans and term deposits are initially o/ff.ligaset and the residual exposure hedged using a portfolio of interest rate swaps up to the designated portion of either the net asset or liability in a given time bucket. For hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness testing Nordea uses both critical terms matching (for prospective e/ff.ligaectiveness testing) and regression analysis (for retrospective e/ff.ligaectiveness testing).\n\nThe table below presents the accumulated fair value adjustments arising from continuing hedge relationships, irrespective of whether or not there has been a change in hedge designation during the year.\n\n## Hedged items\n\n|                                         | Interest rate risk 2021                          | Interest rate risk 2021                                        | Interest rate risk 2020                          | Interest rate risk 2020                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EURm                                    | Carrying amount of  hedged assets/ liabilities 1 | of which accumulated  amount of fair value  hedge adjustment 2 | Carrying amount of  hedged assets/ liabilities 1 | of which accumulated  amount of fair value  hedge adjustment 2 |\n| Fair value hedges                       |                                                  |                                                                |                                                  |                                                                |\n| Loans to the public                     | 94,177                                           | -65                                                            | 56,209                                           | 359                                                            |\n| Interest-bearing securities/three.numr  | 14,732                                           | 0                                                              | 18,155                                           | -                                                              |\n| Assets                                  | 108,909                                          | -65                                                            | 74,364                                           | 359                                                            |\n| Deposits and borrowings from the public | 18,109                                           | 81                                                             | 16,987                                           | 534                                                            |\n| Debt securitites in issue               | 62,166                                           | 619                                                            | 66,481                                           | 1,736                                                          |\n| Subordinated liabilities                | 5,714                                            | 105                                                            | 6,587                                            | 338                                                            |\n| Liabilities                             | 85,989                                           | 805                                                            | 90,055                                           | 2,608                                                          |",

This variability in cash flows is hedged by interest rate swaps, fixing the hedged cash flows according to Nordea's policies and risk management strategy described in section 10 'Hedge accounting' in Note G1 and in section 4 'Market risk' in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nThe hypothetical derivative method is used for e/ff.ligaectiveness testing. The hypothetical derivative represents the characteristics of the hedged items (variable rate loans) in terms of the hedged volume, repricing and interest payment periods. Hedge e/ff.ligaectiviness is calculated on a cumulative basis by comparing changes in a portfolio of interest rate swaps (hedging instruments) and hypothetical derivatives. Changes in the valuation of the hedging instruments that are part of e/ff.ligaective cash flow hedge relationships are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe tables below provide information about the hedging instruments in hedges of interest rate risk, including the notional and the fair value of the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                    | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm  | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges   |              |              |                 |\n| Interest rate risk | 22           | -            | 750             |\n\n|                    | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2020, EURm  | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges   |              |              |                 |\n| Interest rate risk | 38           | 14           | 2,134           |\n\nThe table below specifies the changes in fair value of hedging instruments arising from continuing hedging relationships, irrespective of whether there has been a change in hedge designation during the year.

Foreign exchange risk from trading activities is limited through a VaR limit, while foreign exchange risk from structural exposures as described below is limited through a stress loss limit for the CET1 ratio impact from foreign exchange fluctuations in a severe but plausible stress scenario, see section 4 'Market risk' in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nNordea's issuance of credits and borrowing can be denominated in the currency of the borrower or investor. Borrowing, investing and lending are not always executed in the same currency, thus exposing Nordea to a foreign exchange risk. Di/ff.ligaerences in exposures to individual currencies that exist between di/ff.ligaerent transactions are predominantly matched by entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps. The currency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of the currency risk and the interest component as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk.\n\nIn addition to the above, Nordea also has exposure to structural foreign currency risk through its foreign operations that have a functional currency other than Nordea's presentation currency, EUR (i.e. a translation risk). Fluctuations in spot exchange rates will cause Nordea's reported net investment in foreign operations to vary and the CET1 ratio to fluctuate due to the currency mismatch between equity and risk exposure amounts. Nordea applies hedge accounting when it hedges its investments in fully consolidated foreign operations whose functional currency is not EUR.\n\nFor hedge accounting relationships related to currency risk, the hedged item is a foreign currency component. The hedge ratio is one to one and is established by matching the notional of the derivatives against the principal of the hedged items.\n\nThe currency component is determined as the change in the present value of the future cash flows using foreign exchange curves. The foreign currency component is separately identifiable and reliably measurable and is typically the most significant component of the overall change in fair value or cash flows.\n\n## Cash flow and net investment hedges\n\nHedged items in cash flow hedges of currency risk are (1) issuance in foreign currencies as well as (2) intra-group lending in foreign currencies where the foreign exchange impact is not eliminated on consolidation. Nordea uses cross-currency interest rate swaps, both float to float and fixed to float, of which the portion related to foreign currency risk, including the cross currency basis impact, is designated as a cash flow hedge. Hedging relationships are established at micro level where each hedged item is hedged using one hedging instrument or a portfolio of hedging instruments.\n\nFor net investment hedges Nordea uses short-term foreign exchange swaps as hedging instruments, and changes to the spot rate are designated as the hedged risk.\n\nThe tables below provide information about the hedging instruments in hedges of currency risks, including the notional and the fair value of the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                                              | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm                            | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges                             |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 459          | 503          | 22,007          |\n| Net investment hedges                        |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 260          | 188          | 3,749           |\n| Total derivatives used for hedge  accounting | 719          | 691          | 25,756          |\n\n|                                              | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2020, EURm                            | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges                             |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 865          | 991          | 23,457          |\n| Net investment hedges                        |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 128          | 349          | 6,463           |\n| Total derivatives used for hedge  accounting | 993          | 1,340        | 29,920          |\n\nThe table below specifies the changes in fair value of hedging instruments arising from continuing hedging relationships, irrespective of whether there has been a change in hedge designation during the year.

The company is the result of the merger of Nordea's and DnB's operations in the Baltics. In 2018 the investment was classified as a joint venture as Nordea held 50.0% of the voting rights. Nordea sold shares in Luminor in 2019 and the holding was classified as an associated undertaking. In 2021 additional shares were sold and Nordea currently holds 11.6% of the shares in Luminor.\n\nAs communicated on 13 September 2018, Nordea and Blackstone have entered into an agreement to sell Nordea's remaining holding in Luminor. The holding was reclassified to 'Assets held for sale' on 30 September 2021 when Nordea concluded that the requirements in IFRS 5 had been fulfilled as the sale of the remaining shares was expected within one year. Income from Luminor was recognised using the equity method and presented as 'Profit from associated undertakings and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method' up until 30 September 2021. During the fourth quarter Nordea accounted for the holding as shares held at fair value as Nordea no longer has any significant influence over Luminor. The fair value of the shares in Luminor equals Nordea's share of the equity of Luminor. As the expected sales price according to the forward sale agreement is 90% of the equity of Luminor, the di/ff.ligaerence is recognised as a derivative with negative fair value.\n\nLuminor applies IFRS in its consolidated financial statements, and the balance sheet and income statement below are based on IFRS. The disclosed figures show the entire Luminor Group, not just Nordea's share. As Luminor was not an associated undertaking on 31 December 2021, no balance sheet figures are disclosed for this date. The income statement shows the result for the period when Luminor was an associated undertaking in 2021, i.e. until 30 September.\n\n## Luminor Group - balance sheet\n\n| EURm                                           | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Assets                                         |               |               |\n| Cash and balances with central banks           | -             | 4,927         |\n| Loans to central banks and credit institutions | -             | 104           |\n| Loans to the public                            | -             | 9,431         |\n| Interest-bearing securities                    | -             | 287           |\n| Derivatives                                    | -             | 43            |\n| Other assets                                   | -             | 132           |\n| Total assets                                   | -             | 14,924        |\n\n## Liabilities and equity\n\n| Deposits by credit institutions         | -   | 47     |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----|--------|\n| Deposits and borrowings from the public | -   | 11,822 |\n| Debt securities in issue                | -   | 1,201  |\n| Derivatives                             | -   | 51     |\n| Other liabilities                       | -   | 138    |\n| Equity                                  | -   | 1,665  |\n| Total liabilities and equity            | -   | 14,924 |\n\n## Luminor Group - income statement\n\n| EURm                                |   9 months 2021 |   12 months 2020 |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Interest income                     |             198 |              274 |\n| Interest expense                    |             -23 |              -47 |\n| Net fee and commission income       |              55 |               74 |\n| Net result from items at fair value |              15 |               28 |\n| Other income                        |               2 |                7 |\n| Total operating income              |             247 |              336 |\n| Sta/ff.liga costs                   |             -72 |             -100 |\n| Other administrative expenses       |            -124 |             -170 |\n| Depreciation and amortisation       |              -9 |              -12 |\n| Net loan losses                     |              17 |              -18 |\n| Operating profit                    |              59 |               36 |\n| Income tax expense                  |              -5 |               -3 |\n| Net profit for the year             |              54 |               33 |\n| Other comprehensive income          |               0 |                0 |\n| Total comprehensive income          |              54 |               33 |",

The recoverable amount is the value in use and is estimated based on the discounted cash flows. Due to the long-term nature of the investments, cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely.\n\nCash flows for the coming three years are based on financial forecasts. The forecasts are based on Nordea's macroeconomic outlook, including information on GDP growth, inflation and benchmark rates for the relevant countries. Based on these macro forecasts, the business areas project how margins, volumes, sales and costs will develop over the coming years. Credit losses are estimated using the longterm average for the di/ff.ligaerent business areas. This results in an income statement for each year. The projected cash flow for each year is the forecast net result in these income statements, reduced by the capital needed to grow the business in accordance with the long-term growth assumptions. For CGUs with more capital than the Group's CET1 target, the expected dividends are included in the cash flows generated by the CGUs down to the Group's CET1 target over a threeyear period. The projections take into consideration the major projects initiated at Nordea. There is also an allocation of central costs to business areas to make sure that the cash flows for the CGUs include all indirect costs. Tax costs are estimated based on the standard tax rate. Cash flows for the period beyond the forecasting period are based on estimated sector growth rates. Growth rates are based on historical data, updated to reflect the current situation.\n\nThe derived cash flows are discounted at a rate based on the market's long-term risk-free rate of interest and yield requirements. The discount rate used in 2021 was 6.8% and the growth rate 1.6%. For 2020 the average discount rate was 5.8% and the average growth rate was 1.4%. The CGUs cover all Nordic currencies. As from 2021 Nordea discounts the future estimated cash flows using one EUR rate for all CGUs. In 2020 Nordea used a weighted average of discount rates in the di/ff.ligaerent currencies.\n\nThe impairment tests conducted in 2021 did not indicate any need for goodwill impairment. See also section 4 of Note G1 'Accounting policies' for more information.\n\nBoth an increase in the discount rate of 1 percentage point and a reduction in the future growth rate of 1 percentage point are considered to be reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions. Such a change would not result in any impairment.",

The premises are mainly divided into head o/ffi.ligace contracts, branch o/ffi.ligace contracts and other contracts.\n\nThe head o/ffi.ligace contracts in the di/ff.ligaerent Nordic countries generally have fixed lease terms of 10-25 years. Usually these contracts either have continuation options or are automatically prolonged unless separately terminated at the end of the lease term.\n\nBranch o/ffi.ligace contracts generally either have fixed lease terms of 1-10 years or are without an end date with the right to terminate. The termination clauses are generally 6-24 months. The main principle is that premises contracts do not contain purchase options. Company car contracts generally have a fixed lease term of less than 5 years.",

The provisions are related to sta/ff.liga restructuring (EUR 109m) and premises-related obligations (EUR 18m). The/uni00A0sta/ff.liga-related provision is mainly related to the new Group business plan, including new financial targets, initiated in 2019 but where payments remain to be executed. Approximately EUR 50m out of the EUR 127m is expected to be utilised/paid out in 2022. All sta/ff.liga-related activities are expected to be executed on in 2022, but payments are expected to extend into 2023. As for any other provision, there is uncertainty surrounding the timing and the amount to be finally paid. The uncertainty is expected to decrease as the plans are  executed.\n\nLoan loss provisions on o/ff.liga-balance sheet items amounted to EUR 183m (EUR 236m). More information on these provisions can be found in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management', section 2 'Credit risk'.\n\nMore information on the provision for AML-related matters can be found in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management', section 6.2 'Financial Crime Prevention'.\n\n|                               | Restruc turing   |   Restruc turing |   Other |   Other |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                          | 2021             |             2020 |    2021 |    2020 |\n| At beginning of year          | 245              |              304 |     115 |     122 |\n| New provisions made           | 26               |               83 |      13 |      21 |\n| Provisions utilised           | -107             |             -138 |     -20 |      -3 |\n| Reversals                     | -38              |               -3 |      -9 |     -25 |\n| Reclassifications             | -                |                0 |       5 |       0 |\n| Translation di/ff.ligaerences | 1                |               -1 |       0 |       0 |\n| At end of year                | 127              |              245 |     104 |     115 |",

Retirement benefit obligations\n\n| EURm                           |   31 Dec 2021 |   31 Dec 2020 |\n|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Retirement benefit assets      |           221 |           144 |\n| Retirement benefit liabilities |           369 |           365 |\n| Net liability (-)/asset (+)    |          -148 |          -221 |\n\nNordea sponsors both defined contribution plans (DCP) and defined benefit plans (DBP). IAS 19 ensures that the pension obligations net of plan assets backing these obligations are reflected on the Group's balance sheet. The major plans in each country are funded schemes covered by assets in pension funds/foundations.\n\nThe plans are structured in accordance with local regulations and legislation, local practice and, where applicable, collective agreements. Nordea's main DBPs in Sweden, Norway and Finland are all employer-financed final salary and service-based pension plans providing pension benefits on top of the statutory systems. All DBPs are closed to new entrants; new employees are o/ff.ligaered DCPs.\n\nIn Sweden DBPs are mainly o/ff.ligaered in accordance with collective agreements and subject to the regulations of the Pension Obligations Vesting Act (Tryggandelagen). Plan assets are held in a separate pension foundation.\n\nIn Norway the DBPs are in accordance with the Nordea Norway occupational pension plan and subject to the Occupational Pension Act (Foretakspensjonloven). In Norway plan assets are also held in a separate pension fund.\n\nIn Finland Nordea provides additional pension benefits on top of the statutory system in accordance with the Nordea Finland occupational pension plan and follows the regulations of the Employees' Pension Act (TyEL). Plan assets are generally held in a separate pension foundation.\n\nMinimum funding requirements di/ff.ligaer between plans, but where such requirements are based on collective agreements or internal policies, the funding requirement is generally that the pension obligations measured using local requirements will be covered in full with a predefined surplus or alternatively safeguarded by a credit insurance contract (Sweden only). Some pension plans are not covered by funding requirements and are generally unfunded. Quarterly assessments are performed to monitor the likely level of future contributions.\n\nDBPs may impact Nordea via changes in the net present value of obligations and/or changes in the market value of plan assets. Changes in obligations are most importantly driven by changes in assumptions on discount rates (interest rates and credit spreads), inflation, salary increases, turnover and mortality as well as relevant experience adjustments where the actual outcome di/ff.ligaers from the assumptions.\n\nAssets are invested in diversified portfolios as further disclosed below, with bond exposures mitigating the interest rate risk in the obligations and a fair amount of real assets (inflation protected) reducing the long-term inflationary risk in liabilities.\n\n## IAS 19 pension calculations and assumptions\n\nCalculations on major plans are performed by external liability calculators and are based on di/ff.ligaerent actuarial assumptions.\n\n## Assumptions/one.numr\n\n|                        | SE    | NO      | FI       | DK    | UK               |\n|------------------------|-------|---------|----------|-------|------------------|\n| 2021                   |       |         |          |       |                  |\n| Discount rate/two.numr | 1.44% | 1.96%   | 0.65%    | 1.05% | 1.53%            |\n| Salary increase        | 3.00% | 2.25%   | 2.25%    | 2.25% | -                |\n| Inflation              | 2.00% | 1.50%   | 1.75%    | - 3   | 3.00%            |\n| Mortality              | DUS14 | K2013BE | Gompertz | FSA   | S3PMA\\_L/ S3PFA 4 |\n| 2020                   |       |         |          |       |                  |\n| Discount rate/two.numr | 1.06% | 1.80%   | 0.15%    | 0.31% | 1.29%            |\n| Salary increase        | 2.50% | 1.75%   | 1.75%    | 2.25% | -                |\n| Inflation              | 1.50% | 1.50%   | 1.25%    | - 3   | 2.50%            |\n| Mortality              | DUS14 | K2013BE | Gompertz | FSA   | S2PMA\\_L/ S2PFA 4 |\n\n## Sensitivities - impact on defined benefit obligations\n\n| %                                 | SE     | NO    | FI    | DK    | UK    |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Discount rate   - Increase 50bp   | -10.6% | -7.7% | -6.2% | -4.8% | -9.4% |\n| Discount rate   - Decrease 50bp   | 11.8%  | 8.6%  | 7.0%  | 5.2%  | 10.4% |\n| Salary increase   - Increase 50bp | 2.5%   | 0.2%  | 0.3%  | 5.8%  | -     |\n| Salary increase   - Decrease 50bp | -2.5%  | -0.2% | -0.3% | -5.4% | -     |\n| Inflation   - Increase 50bp       | 10.3%  | 8.4%  | 5.1%  | -     | 1.7%  |\n| Inflation   - Decrease 50bp       | -9.3%  | -8.0% | -4.7% | -     | -1.7% |\n| Mortality   - Increase 1 year     | 5.1%   | 3.7%  | 5.0%  | 6.5%  | 5.0%  |\n| Mortality   - Decrease 1 year     | -5.1%  | -4.9% | -4.8% | -6.3% | -4.5% |\n\nThe sensitivity analyses are prepared by changing one actuarial assumption while keeping the other assumptions unchanged. This is a simplified approach because the actuarial assumptions are usually correlated. However, it makes it possible to isolate one e/ff.ligaect from another. The method used for calculating the impact on the obligations is the same as when calculating the obligations accounted for in the financial statements. The sensitivity analyses include the impact on the liabilities held for future special wage tax (SWT) or  social security contributions (SSC) in Sweden and Norway, respectively.\n\nAs all pensions in Denmark are salary indexed, inflation has no impact on the DBOs in Denmark.",

        "page_content": "## G34.  Retirement benefit obligations, cont.\n\n## Multi-employer plans\n\nIn 2010 the Norwegian parliament decided to change the AFP (Avtalefestet Pensjon) plan in Norway as from 2011. The change gave rise to a new multi-employer defined benefit plan that cannot be calculated as such, as information on Nordea's share of the liabilities and pension costs in the plan is not available from Fellesordningen (the administrator). Consequently, the AFP plan has to be accounted for as a DCP in accordance with IAS 19. Information on the funded status of the plan is not available.\n\nThe AFP plan gives the entitled employees a lifelong addition to their regular pensions from the age of 62. Furthermore, the scheme allows employees to continue working while receiving AFP without this a/ff.ligaecting their pension rights. The plan is founded on the basis of the tripartite cooperation between employer organisations, employee organisations and the Norwegian government. The government covers one-third of the pension expense for the AFP plan, while the member companies collectively cover the remaining twothirds of the pension expense. The premium paid by the member companies to the plan is determined to be su/ffi.ligacient to cover ongoing pension expenses and provide a basis for building up a pension fund. The purpose of the pension fund is to ensure su/ffi.ligacient capital to cover expected future pension obligations.\n\nThe premium rate for 2021 was 2.5% of employees' wages between 1 and 7.1 times the average base amount according to the Norwegian National Insurance Act. The premium is calculated based on average wages and average base amounts from the previous year, excluding employees over the age of 61. Total premiums paid in 2021 amounted to EUR 3m. Payments into the plan in 2021 covered 2,288 employees.\n\nThe premium rate for 2022 will be 2.6% of the employees' wages between 1 and 7.1 times the average base amount according to the Norwegian National Insurance Act. The expected premiums in 2022 will amount to EUR 3m.\n\nThe employees that meet the requirements for AFP are guaranteed AFP payments regardless of the solvency of their employers. Consequently, the employer members have joint responsibility for two-thirds of the pensions payable to employees who at any given time meet the requirements for AFP. Any deficit or surplus in the event that the plan is wound up or entities withdraw from the plan will not have any impact on Nordea.\n\n## Key management personnel\n\nThe Group's total pension obligations regarding key management personnel amounted to EUR 7m (EUR 7m) at the end of the year. These obligations are largely covered by plan assets. Defined benefit pension costs ('Current service cost' as well as 'Past service cost and settlements' as defined in IAS 19) related to key management personnel in 2021 were EUR 0m (EUR 0m). Complete information concerning key management personnel is disclosed in Note G8 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.\n\n## G35.

Loan guarantees are provided for customers to guarantee obligations in other credit and pension institutions. Other guarantees mainly consist of commercial guarantees such as bid guarantees, advance payment guarantees, warranty guarantees and export-related guarantees. Contingent liabilities also include unutilised irrevocable import documentary credits and confirmed export documentary credits. These transactions are part of the bank's services and support Nordea's customers. Guarantees and documentary credits are o/ff.liga-balance sheet items, unless there is a need for a provision to cover a probable loan loss which is based on the assessment that reimbursement will not be received. The table above includes all issued guarantees, also those for which the possibility of an outflow of resources is considered remote.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken, in relation to certain individuals and on certain conditions, to be responsible for the potential payment liability against these individuals in their capacity of managing directors or board members of group undertakings of Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken to indemnify the members of the GLT against legal expenses incurred in relation to legal advice in defending or disputing certain claims or inves-\n\ntigations by third parties, excluding crimes or actions made with intent or gross negligence. For each GLT member, the indemnity is capped at an aggregate amount of EUR 37.5m, unless the Board decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis. Nordea purchases D&O insurance which provides cover for liability assumed by the bank following the indemnification undertaking.\n\nA limited number of employees are entitled to severance pay if they are dismissed before reaching their normal retirement age. For further information, see Note G8 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.\n\n## Claims in civil lawsuits and possible fines\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and disputes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts, as well as possible fines due to e.g. weak AML processes and procedures in the past. At present, none of the current disputes are considered likely to have any significant adverse e/ff.ligaect on Nordea or its financial position. As previously stated, Nordea expects to be fined in Denmark for weak AML processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters. Nordea cannot exclude the possibility of fines, which could impact the bank's financial performance. In addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation.

As at 31 December 2021 Nordea had signed reverse repurchase agreements that have not yet been settled and consequently are not recognised on the balance sheet. On the settlement date, these reverse repurchase agreements will, as far as possible, replace existing reverse repurchase agreements not yet derecognised as at 31 December 2021. The net impact on the balance sheet is minor. These instruments have not been disclosed as commitments.\n\nFor information on credit commitments, see section 26 'Financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments' in Note G1 'Accounting policies', for derivatives, see Note G19 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' and for reverse repurchase agreements, see Note G43 'Transferred assets and obtained collateral'.",

Classification of financial instruments, cont.\n\n## Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\n| EURm                                           | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying amount at end of year                 | 4,363  | 4,431  |\n| Maximum exposure to credit risk at end of year | 4,363  | 4,431  |\n\nAssets designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option) consist of all assets in Life & Pension held under investment contracts, EUR 4,083m (EUR 4,216m). Also, assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts in Life & Pension, EUR 280m (EUR 215m), are designated at fair value through profit or loss. For more information see Note G1, section 13. Nordea does not disclose the e/ff.ligaect of changes in credit risk on the fair values of these assets, as any such change in value will directly result in essentially the opposite change in the carrying amount of the corresponding liabilities to policyholders. There is thus no significant impact on the income statement or equity due to changes in the credit risk of these assets in Life & Pension. For this reason Nordea does not disclose the nominal amount of credit derivatives used to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the year.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss consist of bonds issued by the Danish group undertaking Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab, EUR 56,439m (EUR 54,411m), structured bonds issued by Markets, EUR 1,568m (EUR 1,796m), deposits linked to the investment return on separate assets, EUR 4,857m (EUR 4,421m), and investment contracts and pooled schemes in Life & Pension, EUR 45,502m (EUR 35,499m). For structured bonds issued by Markets, changes in fair value due to changes in own credit risk\n\nare recognised in other comprehensive income, and Nordea calculates the change in its own credit spread based on the change in its funding spread by assuming that the liquidity premium for the issuance is constant over time. The change in the credit spread is estimated by comparing the value of the trades using the initial funding spread on the issuance date and the actual funding spread on the reporting date. This model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk. The value of the investment contracts in Life & Pension and asset-linked deposits is directly linked to the assets in the contracts and there is consequently no e/ff.ligaect from changes in own credit risk of these contracts.\n\nChanges in fair value due to changes in own credit risk of bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab are calculated by determining the amount of fair value changes that are not attributable to changes in market conditions. The method used to estimate the amount of changes in market conditions is based on relevant benchmark interest rates which are the average yields on Danish and German (EUR) government bonds. This model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk. The changes in own credit risk on mortgage bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab are not recognised in other comprehensive income as that would create an accounting mismatch with the corresponding change in the fair value of the mortgage loans that are recognised in profit or loss. For this reason, the fair value change in mortgage bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab is recognised in the income statement. For the mortgage bonds issued, a change in the credit risk and price of the liability will have a corresponding e/ff.ligaect on the value of the loans as a change in the price of the bonds will be o/ff.ligaset by the opposite change in the value of the prepayment option of the loans.\n\n## Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|                                                                           | 2021                                                                 | 2021                                                                             | 2021    | 2020                                                                 | 2020                                                                             | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| EURm                                                                      | Liabilities for  which changes  in credit risk are  presented in OCI | Liabilities for  which changes  in credit risk are  presented in  profit or loss | Total   | Liabilities for  which changes  in credit risk are  presented in OCI | Liabilities for  which changes  in credit risk are  presented in  profit or loss | Total  |\n| Carrying amount at end of year                                            | 1,568                                                                | 106,798                                                                          | 108,366 | 1,796                                                                | 94,331                                                                           | 96,127 |\n| Amount to be paid at maturity/one.numr                                    | 1,568                                                                | 110,220                                                                          | 111,788 | 1,829                                                                | 97,269                                                                           | 99,098 |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes in own credit  risk, during the year | -2                                                                   | -119                                                                             | -121    | -9                                                                   | 35                                                                               | 26     |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes in own credit  risk, accumulated     | -16                                                                  | -540                                                                             | -556    | -14                                                                  | -421                                                                             | -435   |",

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The categorisation of these instruments is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\nLevel 1 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with su/ffi.ligacient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. This category includes listed derivatives, listed equities, government bonds in developed countries as well as most liquid mortgage bonds and corporate bonds where direct tradable price quotes exist.\n\nLevel 2 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities where directly quoted market prices are not available in active markets. The fair values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Alternatively, the fair values are estimated using valuation techniques or valuation models based on market prices or inputs prevailing at the balance sheet date and where any unobservable inputs have not had a signifi-\n\ncant impact on the fair values. This is the case for the majority of Nordea's OTC derivatives, securities purchased/sold under resale/repurchase agreements, securities borrowed/lent and other instruments where active markets supply the input to the valuation techniques or models.\n\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities for which fair values cannot be obtained directly from quoted market prices or indirectly using valuation techniques or models supported by observable market prices or rates. This is generally the case for investments in unlisted securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, investment properties, more complex OTC derivatives where unobservable input has a significant impact on the fair values, certain complex or structured financial instruments and illiquid interest-bearing securities. Complex valuation models are generally characterised by the use of unobservable and model-specific inputs.\n\nAll valuation models, both complex and simple models, make use of market prices and inputs, which comprise interest rates, volatilities, correlations etc. Some of these prices and inputs are observable while others are not. For most nonexotic currencies, the interest rates are all observable, and implied volatilities and the correlations of the interest rates and FX rates may be observable through option prices up to a certain maturity. Implied volatilities and correlations may also be observable for the most liquid equity instruments. For less liquid equity names, the option market is fairly illiquid, and hence implied volatilities and correlations are unobservable.\n\nFor interest-bearing securities, the categorisation into the three levels is based on the internal valuation methodology.",

Assets and liabilities at fair value, cont.\n\nThe valuation of these instruments can either be based on direct quotes in active markets (Level 1) or measured using a methodology giving a quote based on observable inputs (Level 2). If the impact of unobservable parameters on the valuation of the bond is significant, the bond is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFor OTC derivatives, valuation models are used to establishing fair value. The models are usually developed in-house and based on assumptions about the behaviour of the underlying asset and on statistical scenario analysis. Most OTC derivatives are categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, implying that all significant model inputs are observable in active markets.\n\nValuations of private equity funds, credit funds and unlisted equity instruments are by nature more uncertain than valuations of more actively traded equity instruments. Emphasis is put on using a consistent approach across all assets and over time. The methods used are consistent with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines issued by the IPEV Board. The guidelines are considered as best practice in the industry. For US-based funds, similar methods are applied.\n\nFurthermore Nordea holds loans and issued debt securities in the subsidiary Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab at fair value. When Nordea grants mortgage loans to borrowers, in accordance with the Danish mortgage legislation, Nordea at the same time issues debt securities with matching terms, socalled match funding. The fair value of the debt securities issued is based on quoted prices. As borrowers have the right to purchase debt securities issued by Nordea in the market and return these as repayment for their loans, the fair value of the loans is the same as the fair value of the bonds issued (due to the revaluation of the repayment option embedded in the loan) adjusted for changes in the credit risk of the borrower and the fair value of the margin associated with each loan.\n\nThe fair value of financial assets and liabilities is generally calculated as the theoretical net present value of the individual instruments. This calculation is supplemented by portfolio adjustments.\n\nNordea incorporates credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) and debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) into derivative valuations. CVAs and DVAs reflect the impact on fair value from the counterparty's credit risk and Nordea's own credit quality, respectively. Calculations are based on estimates of exposure at default, probability of default (PD) and recovery rates on a counterparty basis. Generally, exposure at default for CVAs and DVAs is based on the expected exposure and estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors. Where possible, Nordea obtains credit spreads from the credit default swap (CDS) market, and PD is inferred from this data. For counterparties that do not have a liquid CDS, the PD is estimated using a cross-sectional regression model, which calculates an appropriate proxy CDS spread based on each counterparty's rating region and industry.\n\nThe impact of funding costs and funding benefits on the valuation of uncollateralised and imperfectly collateralised derivatives is recognised as a funding fair valuation adjustment (FFVA). In addition, Nordea applies its fair value measurement close-out-cost valuation adjustments and model risk adjustments for identified model deficiencies. Adjustments for IPV variances are also included in fair value.\n\nNordea's pricing models are calibrated to the market, and if climate risk has any impact on a particular market, it will already be taken into consideration by other market participants. Hence, Nordea has not implemented any changes to its pricing models to take climate risk into account and no critical valuation adjustments have been made. Going forward, Nordea will monitor areas in the valuation space where climate risk could have an impact on the models (e.g. in relation to credit valuation adjustment).\n\nThe fair value measurement of investment properties takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits through the highest and best use of the property, i.e. taking into account the use of the property in a way that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible. The current use of the investment properties of Nordea is in accordance with the highest and best use. The valuation of the investment properties is carried out taking into account the purpose and the nature of the properties by using the most appropriate valuation methods. The primary valuation approach is a discounted cash flow model using current cash flows, market interest rates and the current yield requirements.\n\n## Transfers between Levels 1 and 2\n\nDuring the year Nordea transferred 'Interest-bearing securities' (including such financial instruments pledged as collateral) of EUR 2,341m (EUR 1,113m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and EUR 439m (EUR 11,448m) from Level 2 to Level 1 as well as 'Shares' of EUR 152m (EUR 5m) from Level 1 to Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Furthermore, Nordea transferred 'Debt securities in issue' of EUR 10,701m (EUR 735m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and EUR 4,954m (EUR 32,916m) from Level 2 to Level 1. Nordea also transferred 'Other liabilities' of EUR 256m (EUR 10m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and EUR 269m (EUR 1,040m) from Level 2 to Level 1. The reason for the transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 was that the instruments ceased to be actively traded during the year and fair values have now been obtained using valuation techniques with observable market inputs. The reason for the transfer from Level 2 to Level 1 was that the instruments have again been actively traded during the year and reliable quoted prices are obtained in the market. The main driver for the transfers during 2020 was an update to the rules for categorisation of financial instruments into Levels 1, 2 and 3. This update had a significant impact on the categorisation of 'Interest-bearing securities' and 'Debt securities in issue' where the volume and frequency of trading of the individual instruments (ISINs) were considered. Transfers between levels are considered to have occurred at the end of the year.",

The main driver for the transfers into and out of Level 3 during the year was an update to the rules for categorisation of financial instruments into Levels 1, 2 and 3. This mainly impacted the categorisation of 'Derivatives', 'Interest-bearing securities', 'Shares' and 'Debt securities in issue' where the volume and frequency of trading of the individual instruments (ISINs) are now considered. Transfers between levels are considered to have occurred at the end of the year. Fair value gains and losses in the income statement during the year are included in 'Net result from items at fair value' (see Note G6). Assets and liabilities related to derivatives are presented net.\n\n## The valuation process for fair value measurements Financial instruments\n\nThe valuation process at Nordea consists of several steps. The first step is to determine the end-of-day mid-prices. It is the responsibility of the business areas to determine the correct prices for the valuation process. These prices are either internally marked prices set by a trading unit or externally sourced prices. The valuation prices and valuation approaches are then controlled and tested by a valuation control function within the first line of defence, which is independent from the risk-taking units of the front o/ffi.ligace. The cornerstone of the control process is the independent price verification (IPV). The IPV test comprises verification of the correctness of valuations by comparing end-of-day mid-prices to independently sourced data. The result of the IPV is analysed and any findings are escalated as appropriate. Also, adjustments for IPV variances are included in fair value. The verification of the correctness of prices and inputs is as a minimum carried out on a monthly basis and is carried out daily for many products. Third-party information, such as broker quotes and pricing services, is used as benchmark data in the verification. The quality of the benchmark data is assessed on a regular basis.\n\nThe valuation adjustment at portfolio level and the deferrals of day 1 P/L on Level 3 trades are calculated and reported\n\non a monthly basis. The actual assessment of instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed on a continuous basis.\n\nSpecialised teams within the risk organisation (CRO) are responsible for overseeing and independently assessing the valuations and controls performed by the business areas and Group Finance (the first line of defence). These teams are responsible for the second line of defence oversight of valuations, with independent reporting responsibilities towards the CRO and the Board Audit Committee.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nThe main part of the investment properties of Nordea is held by Life & Pension. The valuation of the investment properties of Life & Pension is performed quarterly by the real estate units of each entity within Life & Pension with full or partial assistance from external valuers. For investment properties where units use their own methodologies, the changes in price levels of the properties are compared with valuations of similar properties assessed by external valuers. The result of the valuations is presented to, and approved by, the local management of each entity. The CFO of each entity within Life & Pension is responsible for the approval of the concepts and for the values used. The principles used by all entities are in accordance with regulations provided by the local financial supervisory authorities, which is in accordance with international valuation principles and in accordance with the IFRS.\n\nIn addition, there is an investment operation committee (IOC) which is a joint forum focusing on the valuation and accounting of investment operations issues within Life & Pension. The entities within Life & Pension report regularly to the IOC and the IOC reports quarterly to the Nordea Group Valuation Committee.\n\nLife & Pension's investment properties are backing the liabilities to policyholders in life insurance contracts, unit-linked contracts and investment contracts, which means that the impact on Nordea's income statement and on shareholders' equity is based on the profit structure on the portfolio of contracts backed by the investments.",

In case the exposure to an unobservable parameter is o/ff.ligaset across di/ff.ligaerent instruments, only the net impact is disclosed in the table. The range disclosed is likely to be greater than the true uncertainty in determining the fair value of these instruments as all\n\nunobservable parameters are in practice unlikely to be simultaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives. The disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.\n\nIn order to calculate the sensitivity (range) of the fair value of derivatives, a range of di/ff.ligaerent modelling approaches is applied to determine an uncertainty interval around the reported fair value. The di/ff.ligaerent approaches applied target various aspects of derivatives pricing. Two common components of derivative valuation models are the volatility of underlying risk factors and the correlation between the relevant risk factors. Each of these is addressed by applying different assumptions to input and/or the choice of modelling",

Significant increases (decreases) in the market rate or yield requirement would in isolation result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value.\n\n## Movements in deferred day 1 profit\n\nIn some cases, the transaction price for financial instruments di/ff.ligaers from the fair value at initial recognition measured using a valuation model, mainly due to the transaction price not beeing established in an active market. If there are significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique (Level 3), the financial instrument is recognised at the transaction price and any di/ff.ligaerence between the transaction price and the fair value at initial recognition measured using a valuation model (day 1 profit) is deferred.

The assumed customer interest rate is calculated as the benchmark interest rate plus the average margin on new lending in Personal Banking, Commercial & Business Banking and Wholesale Banking, respectively.\n\nThe fair value measurement is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Interest bearing-securities\n\nThe fair value is EUR 3,560m (EUR 3,548m), of which EUR -m (EUR 136m) is categorised into Level 1 and EUR 2,154m (EUR 3,332m) into Level 2 and EUR 1,406m (EUR 80m) into Level 3. The measurement principles follow those for similar instruments that are held at fair value on the balance sheet.\n\n## Other assets and prepaid expenses and accrued income\n\nThe balance sheet items 'Other assets' and 'Prepaid expenses and accrued income' consist of short receivables. The fair value is therefore considered to equal the carrying amount and is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Deposits and debt instruments\n\nThe fair value of the balance sheet rows 'Deposits by credit institutions', 'Deposits and borrowings from the public', 'Debt securities in issue' and 'Subordinated liabilities' has been calculated as the carrying amount adjusted for fair value changes in interest rate risk and in own credit risk. The fair value is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value changes related to interest rate risk are based on changes in relevant interest rates compared with the corresponding nominal interest rates of the portfolios. The fair value changes in credit risk are calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the credit spread of the nominal interest rate and the current spread observed in the market. This calculation is performed on an aggregated level for all long-term issuance recognised in the balance sheet items 'Debt securities in issue' and 'Subordinated liabilities'. As the contractual maturity is short for 'Deposits by credit institutions' and 'Deposits and borrowings from the public', the changes in Nordea's own credit risk related to these items are assumed not to be significant. This is also the case for short-term issuance recognised in the balance sheet line items 'Debt securities in issue' and 'Subordinated liabilities'.\n\n## Other liabilities and accrued expenses and prepaid income\n\nThe balance sheet items 'Other liabilities' and 'Accrued expenses and prepaid income' consist of short-term liabilities, mainly liabilities on securities settlement. The fair value is therefore considered to be equal to the carrying amount and is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",

Financial instruments set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet or subject to netting agreements, cont.\n\n## Enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements\n\nThe fact that financial instruments are accounted for on a gross basis on the balance sheet, does not imply that the financial instruments are not subject to master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Generally financial instruments (derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions) are subject to master netting agreements, and Nordea is consequently able to benefit from netting, in the event of default by its counterparties, in any calculations involving counterparty credit risk.\n\nFor a description of counterparty risk see also Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management', section 3 'Counterparty risk'.\n\n## G43.  Transferred assets and obtained collateral\n\n## Transferred assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities\n\nAssets are considered to be transferred from Nordea if Nordea either transfers the contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets or retains that right but has a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more entities.\n\nAll assets transferred continue to be recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea is still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets. This is the case for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and derivative transactions.\n\nRepurchase agreements are a form of collateral borrowing where Nordea sells securities with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date at a fixed price. The cash received is recognised as a deposit (liability). Securities delivered under repurchase agreements are not derecognised from the balance sheet.\n\nSecurities lending transactions are transactions where Nordea lends securities it holds to a counterparty and receives a fee.\n\nIn derivative transactions Nordea delivers collateral which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. Such transactions are mainly related to collateral delivered under CSA agreements.\n\nAs both repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions result in the securities being returned to Nordea, all risks and rewards associated with the instruments transferred are retained by Nordea although they are not available to Nordea during the period during which they are transferred. The counterparties to the transactions hold the securities as collateral but have no recourse to other assets in Nordea.\n\nThe securities are still reported on the balance sheet and the corresponding liabilities are measured at fair value or at amortised cost.\n\nOnly transferred shares and bonds reported on the balance sheet are reported in the table below.\n\n## G43.

The transactions are conducted under standard agreements employed by financial market participants. Generally, the agreements require additional collateral to be provided if the value of the securities falls below a predetermined level. Under the standard terms of most repurchase transactions, the recipient of collateral has an unrestricted right to sell or repledge it, subject to returning equivalent securities on settlement of the transactions. The fair value of the securities obtained as collateral under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements is disclosed below. Nordea also obtains collateral under other agreements which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. Such collateral is mainly received under CSA agreements covering derivative transactions. The received collaterals presented in the table below is not recognised on the balance sheet.\n\n| EURm                                                | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Reverse repurchase agreements                       |               |               |\n| Collateral received that can be repledged   or sold | 20,594        | 24,458        |\n| - of which repledged or sold                        | 9,540         | 11,709        |\n| Securities borrowing agreements                     |               |               |\n| Collateral received that can be repledged   or sold | 2,786         | 3,177         |\n| - of which repledged or sold                        | 183           | 712           |\n| Other agreements                                    |               |               |\n| Collateral received that can be repledged   or sold | 864           | 625           |\n| - of which repledged or sold                        | 202           | 349           |\n| Total                                               | 24,244        | 28,260        |",

It normally has restricted activities with a/uni00A0narrow and well-defined objective. If Nordea controls such an entity, it is consolidated.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nViking ABCP Conduit (Viking) has been established with the purpose of supporting trade receivable or accounts payable securitisation transactions to core Nordic customers. The SPE purchases trade receivables from approved sellers and funds the purchases either by issuing commercial paper (CP) via the established asset-backed commercial paper programme or by drawing funds under the liquidity facilities available.\n\nNordea has provided liquidity facilities to a maximum of EUR 964m (EUR 857m) and at year end EUR 856m (EUR 755m) was utilised. The total assets of the conduit amounted to EUR 1,007m (EUR 821m) at year end. The SPE is consolidated as it is closely linked to the activities within Nordea. Also, Nordea is exposed to credit risk through the liquidity facility. There are no significant restrictions on repayment of loans from Viking apart from the payments being dependent on the rate at which Viking releases its assets.\n\nAR Finance invests in notes backed by trade receivables. Nordea has provided liquidity facilities to a maximum of EUR 125m (EUR 125m) and at year end EUR 121m (EUR 81m) was utilised. The entity held assets of EUR 122m (EUR 81m) at year end.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nFor structured entities in which Nordea has an interest but over which Nordea has no control, disclosures are provided. To be considered to have an interest in such an entity, Nordea must be exposed to variability in returns on the investment in the structured entity. Investment funds are the only interests in unconsolidated structured entities currently held by Nordea. Variability in returns is assessed based on both fees received and revaluations of holdings in the funds.\n\nNordea invests in investment funds\n\n- a) on behalf of policyholders in Nordea Life & Pension\n- b)  on behalf of depositors where the return is based on the investment\n- c)  to hedge exposures to structured products issued to customers\n- d)  that are illiquid private equity and credit funds.\n\nAs Nordea is exposed to variability in returns on a gross basis, information about these funds is disclosed although the net exposure is considerably less. Any change in the value of investment funds acquired on behalf of policyholders and depositors where the policyholder/depositor stands the investment risk is reflected in the value of the related liability and the maximum net exposure to losses is zero. The change in the value of investment funds held on behalf of other policyholders is largely passed on to the policyholders, but as Nordea has issued guarantees in respect of some of these products, Nordea is exposed to value changes.",

Investments in illiquid private equity and credit funds are an integral part of managing balance sheet risks at Nordea. The maximum loss on these funds is estimated at EUR 875m (EUR 735m), equal to the investments in the funds.\n\nNordea's interests in unconsolidated structured entities and any related liability are disclosed in the table below.

These have di/ff.ligaerent investment mandates and types of risk appetite, ranging from low risk government bond funds to high risk leveraged equity funds. The total assets of funds managed by Nordea are EUR 233bn (EUR 194bn). All funds are financed by deposits from unit holders. The total assets of investment funds not managed by Nordea are not considered meaningful for the purpose of understanding the related risks and are thus not disclosed.\n\nNordea has established two unconsolidated structured entities, Archean and Thulite,  in which Nordea does not currently have an interest. As Nordea does not control them, they are considered to have been sponsored by Nordea. Nordea did not enter into any new transaction with Thulite during 2021. Previously Nordea bought protection in the form of a CDS and a financial guarantee from Thulite. Nordea received less than EUR 1m in income from Thulite in 2020 and 2021. All transactions with Archean were terminated in 2020 and the entity is now dormant.",

Regulatory restrictions, both general and local, on dividends as well as projected changes in the entities' capital requirements and risk exposure amounts are incorporated into the analysis regarding the dividend decisions.\n\nThe CRR requires credit institutions to hold liquid assets, the sum of the values of which covers the liquidity outflows less the liquidity inflows under stressed conditions so as to ensure that institutions maintain levels of liquidity bu/ff.ligaers which are adequate. There are also local liquidity requirements that restrict the movement of funds between legal entities.\n\nThe Group has pledged assets to collateralise its obligations under repurchase agreements, securities financing transactions, collateralised loan obligations and for margining purposes of OTC derivative liabilities. Further information is disclosed in Notes G36 and G37.\n\nFor banks under resolution, which was not applicable to Nordea at the balance sheet date, there are potential restrictions as the regulators have far-reaching resolution tools they can impose if deemed necessary.\n\nStatutory, contractual or regulatory requirements as well as protective rights of non-controlling interests might restrict the ability of the Group to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group. Since the Group did not have any material noncontrolling interests at the balance sheet date, any protective rights associated with these did not give rise to significant restrictions.",

        "page_content": "## G48.  IBOR reform\n\nThe IBOR transition is a global reform with significant impact on the financial industry. It a/ff.ligaects a large variety of financial products and services and thus individuals, companies and institutions. The transition influences products, market liquidity, risk management, data and technology infrastructure as well as financials and the balance sheet. IBORs are embedded in a vast range of financial instruments, including loans, mortgages, bonds, trading products and derivative contracts.\n\nIn March 2021 the British Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) announced that sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen LIBOR rates, as well as 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR rates, will cease at end-2021, with the remaining US dollar LIBOR rates ceasing at end-June 2023.\n\nIn May 2019 the European Money Markets Institute (EMMI, the administrator of EONIA) announced a change in EONIA's methodology. From October 2019 EONIA has been calculated as \u20acSTR plus a spread. EMMI further announced it would provide EONIA under the changed methodology until 3 January 2022 after which date it would be discontinued.\n\nOther IBORs, such as EURIBOR and Nordic IBORs, have already or are currently undergoing reforms and are expected to continue to be published in the foreseeable future.\n\nAs LIBOR and EONIA will not be available after their respective cessation dates, market participants need to remove their dependency on these rates. This includes enabling capability to reference new benchmark rates in financial contracts (such as \u20acSTR instead of EONIA, SONIA instead of GBP LIBOR and SOFR instead of USD LIBOR) and to transition legacy contracts to new benchmark rates.\n\nNordea has established an IBOR Transition Programme sponsored by the CFO to prepare and coordinate Group-wide e/ff.ligaorts to manage the operational impacts and financial risks caused by the transition from existing IBORs to alternative near risk-free rates. An IBOR Transition O/ffi.ligace is responsible for the Group-wide coordination of transition activities and reports to a steering committee with participation from senior management of the business areas and Group functions to ensure a centralised Nordea strategy and senior management steering and oversight. The business areas and Group functions are responsible for and drive the execution of changes required for a successful transition to alternative near riskfree rates.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021 Nordea continues to have exposure to USD LIBOR, while all contracts referencing other LIBOR rates and EONIA have been or will on 1 January 2022 be transitioned to new rates through the use of contractual fallbacks or otherwise mitigated.\n\nThe remaining legacy USD LIBOR contracts will either mature or be transitioned to new benchmark rates, or otherwise mitigated, before or on the USD LIBOR cessation date on 30 June 2023.\n\nThe new near risk-free rates lack the credit spread component present in current IBORs. This means that due to changes in credit spreads Nordea may be less able to pass on changes in funding costs, which have historically been passed on automatically through IBORs. This risk is considered manageable within the current risk management strategy.\n\nNordea has adopted the Phase I and Phase II amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 39. Disclosures on financial instruments with IBORs that remain to be transitioned can be found in the below table (only USD LIBOR).\n\n|                                       | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount   |                  |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                                  | Assets            | Liabilities       | Notional  amount |\n| Non-derivative financial  instruments | 5,255             | 3,319             |                  |\n| Derivatives                           |                   |                   | 310,566          |\n| Not used in hedge accounting          |                   |                   | 287,947          |\n| Used in hedge accounting              |                   |                   | 22,618           |\n| Fair value hedges                     |                   |                   | 17,548           |\n| Cash flow hedges                      |                   |                   | 5,070            |",

Nordea Bank Abp is a public limited liability company organised under the laws of Finland with its head o/ffi.ligace located in Helsinki, Finland at the following address: Hamnbanegatan (Satamaradankatu) 5, FI-00020 Nordea, Helsinki, Finland. Nordea Bank Abp's ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq Nordic, the stock exchanges in Helsinki (in euro), Stockholm (in Swedish krona) and Copenhagen (in Danish krone) and its American Depository Receipts (ADR) are traded in the US in US dollars.\n\nOn 23 February 2022 the Board of Directors approved the financial statements, subject to final adoption by the Annual General Meeting on 24 March 2022.\n\n## /one.osf. Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements for Nordea Bank Abp are prepared in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Decree of the Finnish Ministry of Finance on the financial statements and consolidated financial statements of credit institutions and investment firms as well as the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines.\n\nThe accounting policies, methods of computation and presentations are unchanged in comparison with the Annual Report 2020, except for the items presented in 'Changed accounting policies and presentation' below.\n\nAll amounts are in euro million unless otherwise stated.\n\n## /two.osf. Changed accounting policies and presentation\n\nThe new accounting requirements implemented during 2021 and their impact on Nordea Bank Abp's financial statements are described below.\n\n## Changed presentation of interest from derivatives used in economic hedges\n\nAs of 1 January 2021 the interest components of derivatives hedging assets in economic hedges have been classified as 'Interest income' and the interest component of derivatives hedging liabilities in economic hedges have been classified as 'Interest expense' in the income statement. Previously, both types of interest component were classified as 'Interest expense'. The new principle better reflects the economic substance of hedging transactions.\n\nComparative figures have been restated accordingly and the impacts in 2021 and 2020, can be found in the table below.\n\n|                     | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   | Full year 2021   |\n|---------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       |\n| Interest income     | 3,583            | -232             | 3,351            |\n| Interest expense    | -891             | 232              | -659             |\n| Net interest income | 2,692            | -                | 2,692            |\n\n|                     | Full year 2020   | Full year 2020   | Full year 2020   |\n|---------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EURm                | Old policy       | Change           | New policy       |\n| Interest income     | 3,906            | -227             | 3,679            |\n| Interest expense    | -1,390           | 227              | -1,163           |\n| Net interest income | 2,516            | -                | 2,516            |\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n\nIn 2020 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published amendments to International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 in 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform' - Phase 2. Phase 2 of the interbank o/ff.ligaered rate (IBOR) reform includes three major areas: hedge accounting, modifications and disclosures. The amendments were implemented by Nordea Bank Abp on 1 January 2021. Hedge relationships in Nordea Bank Abp can continue as before and no material modification gains or losses have been recognised.\n\nThe amendments clarify that hedge accounting does not have to be discontinued in the event that hedged items and hedging instruments are modified due to the IBOR reform. Hedging relationships (and related documentation) must be amended to reflect modifications to the hedged item, hedging instrument and hedged risk. Any valuation adjustments resulting from the amendments are recognised as part of hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness.\n\nModifications required as a direct consequence of the IBOR reform and made on an economically equivalent basis are not accounted for as modifications to instruments measured at amortised cost. For such modifications, the e/ff.ligaective interest rate is amended in line with the modified cash flows.\n\n## /three.osf. Recognition of operating income\n\n## Net interest income\n\nInterest income and expense are calculated and recognised using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method or, if considered appropriate, a method that provides a reasonable approximation in line with the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method as the basis for the calculation. The e/ff.ligaective interest includes fees considered to be an integral part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of a financial instrument (generally fees received as compensation for risk). The e/ff.ligaective interest rate equals the rate that dis-",

Accounting policies, cont.\n\ncounts the estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.\n\nNegative interest on liabilities is presented in the line item 'Interest income' and negative interest on assets in the line item 'Interest expense'. In the line item 'Interest income', Nordea Bank Abp presents interest income from financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through the fair value reserve. This line item also includes the e/ff.ligaect from hedge accounting relating to these assets.\n\nInterest income and interest expense from financial instruments are, with the exceptions described below, classified as 'Net interest income'.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value in Markets are classified as 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' in the income statement. Also, interest on the net funding of operations in Markets are recognised in this line item to ensure that income and expense within these operations are presented in a consistent manner.\n\nThe interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' except for derivatives used for hedging purposes. In accounting hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Interest income calculated using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability in Note P4 'Net interest income'. In economic hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Other interest income' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability in Note P4 'Net interest income'.\n\n## Net fee and commission income\n\nNordea Bank Abp earns commission income from di/ff.ligaerent services provided to customers and other group companies. Asset management commissions and Life & Pension commissions are mainly generated from the services provided to other group companies.\n\nThe recognition of commission income depends on the purpose for which the fees are received. Fees are recognised as revenue when services are provided or in connection with the execution of a significant act. Fees received in connection with performed services are recognised as income in the period when these services are provided.\n\nFees categorised as 'Deposit products', 'Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance', 'Custody and issuer service', 'Payments\" and 'Cards' are recognised both over time and at a point of time depending on when the performance obligations are satisfied. Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance are mainly transactional driven in relation to advising customers or executing customer transactions in securities where the services are recognised at a point of time when the services related to the transactions are completed. Payment commissions include fees for cash management and payment solutions that are recognised over time and transactions-based fees for services like domestic and foreign payments that are recognised at a point of time. Card fees are categorised as interchange fees which are recognised at a point of time when the customer uses the services, or as cardholder fees which are recognised over time or at a point of time if the fee is transaction based.\n\nLending fees that are not part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of a financial instrument are recognised at a point of time. Loan syndication fees, as well as other transaction-based fees received are recognised at a point when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when the syndication or transaction has been performed. Fees received for bilateral transactions\n\nare generally amortised as part of the e/ff.ligaective interest rate of the financial instruments recognised.\n\nIncome from issued financial guarantees, and expenses for bought financial guarantees, are amortised over the duration of the instruments and classified as 'Fee and commission income' and 'Fee and commission expense', respectively. Other fee income is generally transaction based.\n\nFor transactional services performed at a point of time, payments are generally made instantly when the services are performed. For services performed over time, the period of service is normally short. Examples of such services are monthly payment services and monthly or quarterly asset management services. For the services performed over time, the right to payment generally arises at the end of the period of service when the performance obligations are completed and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of the consideration will occur. However, for some services with fixed monthly fees, the right to payment arises in advance. Account receivables are recognised as 'Other assets', while unbilled receivables for satisfied performance obligations and contract assets are recognised as 'Prepaid expenses and accrued income'. Short-term advances received where the performance obligations have not yet been satisfied are recognised as 'Accrued expenses and prepaid income'.\n\nCommission expenses are normally transaction based and recognised in the period when the services are received. Initial contract costs for obtaining contracts are recognised as an asset and amortised if the costs are expected to be recovered.\n\n## Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing\n\nRealised and unrealised gains and losses on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the line item 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing'. Realised and unrealised gains and losses derive from:\n\n- \u00b7 shares/participations and other share-related instruments\n- \u00b7\n- interest-bearing securities and other interest-related instruments\n- \u00b7 other financial instruments, including credit derivatives as well as commodity instruments/derivatives\n- \u00b7 foreign exchange gains/losses.\n\n## Net result from securities trading\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value in Markets are classified as 'Net result from securities trading' in the income statement. Furthermore, the interest component of derivatives, including changes in accrued interest, is classified as 'Net result from securities trading', except for derivatives used for hedging purposes, including economic hedges where such components are classified in the same income statement line as the interest from the hedged asset and liability.\n\nAlso, interest on the net funding of operations in Markets is recognised in this line to ensure that income and expense within these operations are presented in a consistent manner. This line item also includes realised gains and losses from financial instruments measured at amortised cost such as interest compensation received and realised gains/losses on buy-backs of issued own debt.\n\n'Net result from securities trading' also includes losses from counterparty risk on instruments classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss'. Impairment losses from instruments within other categories are recognised in the line items 'Net loan losses' or 'Impairment of other financial assets' (see also the subsections 'Net",

Income is recognised in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## Net result from foreign exchange dealing\n\nNet gains and losses on trading in foreign currencies and the positive and negative exchange di/ff.ligaerences arising from translation into euro of assets, liabilities and the principal of currency swaps are recognised in 'Net result from foreign exchange dealing'. The period's proportion of gains and losses on measurement of forward foreign exchange contracts, currency futures and currency options is also included in this item. Foreign exchange di/ff.ligaerences arising from non-monetary held-for-sale assets are recognised in the fair value reserve under equity.\n\n## Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve\n\nRecycled gains and losses on financial instruments classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised in 'Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve'.\n\n## Net result from hedge accounting\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items under fair value hedges are classified as 'Net result from hedge accounting'. The ine/ff.ligaective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument under cash flow hedge is recycled to the line item 'Net result from hedge accounting'. Hedge accounting is described in section 7 'Hedge Accounting'.\n\n## Net result from investment properties\n\nIncome and expenses from investment properties, such as rental income and expenses and sales gains and losses, regardless of whether the property is measured using the fair value method or the acquisition cost less depreciation and impairment loss are recognised in 'Net result from investment properties'. This item also includes items recognisable in profit or loss due to the measurement method (depreciation according to plan and impairments, reversals of impairment or fair value changes).\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nDividends received from other than trading shares as well as group contributions are recognised in the income statement as 'Income from equity investments'. Income is recognised in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## Other operating income and other operating and administrative expenses\n\nNet gains from divestment of shares in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures and net gains from the sale of tangible assets as well as other operating income, not related to any other income line, are generally recognised when it is probable that the benefits associated with the transaction will flow to Nordea Bank Abp and if the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer (generally when the transaction is finalised).\n\nA resolution fee is presented as 'Other operating expenses' in the income statement.\n\n## /four.osf. Impairment\n\n## Net loan losses\n\nImpairment losses on financial assets classified into the category 'Amortised cost' (see section 11 'Financial instruments'), in the line items 'Loans to credit institutions' and 'Loans to the public'  on the balance sheet, are reported as 'Net loan losses' in the income statement together with losses from financial guarantees. Losses are reported net of any collateral and other credit enhancements. Nordea Bank Abp's accounting policies for the calculation of impairment losses on loans can be found in section 12 'Loans to the public/credit institutions'.\n\nCounterparty losses on instruments classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss', including credit derivatives but excluding loans held at fair value as described above, are reported under 'Net result from securities trading'.\n\n## Impairment of other financial assets\n\nImpairment of investments in interest-bearing securities, classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' (see section 11 'Financial instruments'), and impairment of investments in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures are presented in the line item 'Impairment of other financial assets' in the income statement. The policies covering impairment of financial assets classified into the category 'Amortised cost' are disclosed in section 11 'Financial instruments' and section 12 'Loans to the public/credit institutions'.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\n## /five.osf. Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments on the balance sheet\n\nDerivative instruments, quoted securities and foreign exchange spot transactions are recognised on and derecognised from (and an asset or a liability is recognised as 'Other assets' or 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet between the trade date and the settlement date) the balance sheet on the trade date. Other financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet on the settlement date.\n\nFinancial assets, other than those for which trade date accounting is applied, are derecognised from the balance sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred to another party. The rights to the cash flows normally expire or are transferred when the counterparty has performed by e.g. repaying a loan to Nordea Bank Abp, i.e. on the settlement date.\n\nLoans and other financial assets where cash flows are modified or part of a restructuring are derecognised, and a new loan recognised if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the old loan. This is normally the case if the present value of the cash flows for the new loan discounted by the original interest rate di/ff.ligaers by more than 10% from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows for the old loan. The same principles apply to financial liabilities. The terms and conditions are also considered to be significantly di/ff.ligaerent for financial assets where the modified cash flows are SPPI, but the original cash flows were not SPPI and vice versa.\n\nIn some cases, Nordea Bank Abp enters into transactions where it transfers assets that are recognised on the balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and",

If all or substantially all risks and rewards are retained, the transferred assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised from the balance sheet when the liability is extinguished. Normally this occurs when Nordea Bank Abp performs, for example when Nordea Bank Abp returns a deposit to the counterparty, i.e. on the settlement date. Financial liabilities under trade date accounting are generally derecognised and a liability is recognised as 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet on the trade date.\n\nFor further information, see sections 'Securities borrowing and lending agreements' and 'Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements' within section 11 'Financial instruments' as well as Note P43 'Transferred assets and obtained collateral'.\n\n## /six.osf. Translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies\n\nNordea Bank Abp presents its financial statements in euro (EUR). Foreign currency is defined as any currency other than euro. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\nExchange di/ff.ligaerences arising on the settlement of transactions at rates di/ff.ligaerent from those on the date of the transactions, and unrealised translation di/ff.ligaerences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing'.\n\n## Currency translation of foreign entities/branches\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign branches have been translated at the closing rates, while items in the income statement are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The average exchange rates are calculated based on daily exchange rates divided by the number of business days in the period. Translation di/ff.ligaerences are recognised in the fair value reserve in equity.\n\nAny remaining equity in foreign branches is converted at the closing rates with translation di/ff.ligaerences recognised in equity.\n\nInformation on the most important exchange rates is disclosed in section 26 'Exchange rates'.\n\n## /seven.osf. Hedge accounting\n\nAs part of Nordea's risk management policy, Nordea Bank Abp has identified a series of risk categories with corresponding hedging strategies using derivative instruments, as set out in section 'Market risk' in Note P2 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note P21 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\nWhen a hedging relationship meets the specified hedge accounting criteria set out in IAS 39, Nordea Bank Abp applies two types of hedge accounting:\n\n- \u00b7 fair value hedge accounting\n- \u00b7 cash flow hedge accounting.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has elected, as a policy choice permitted under IFRS 9, to continue to apply hedge accounting in accordance with the carve-out version of IAS 39.\n\nUnder the EU carve-out version of IAS 39, fair value macro hedge accounting may for instance, in comparison with IAS 39 as issued by the IASB, be applied to core deposits and hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness in a hedge of assets with prepayment options is only recognised when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows falls below the designated bottom layer.\n\nAt inception, Nordea Bank Abp formally documents how the hedging relationship meets the hedge accounting criteria, including the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the nature of the risk, the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and the method that will be used to assess the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the hedging relationship on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe application of hedge accounting requires the hedge to be highly e/ff.ligaective. A hedge is regarded as highly e/ff.ligaective if at inception and throughout its life it can be expected that changes in the fair value of the hedged item, as regards the hedged risk, can be essentially o/ff.ligaset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The result should be within a range of 80-125 %.\n\nTransactions that are entered into in accordance with Nordea Bank Abp's hedging objectives but do not qualify for hedge accounting, are economic hedge relationships.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nFair value hedge accounting is applied when derivatives are hedging changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability attributable to a specific risk in accordance with Nordea's risk management policies set out in section 'Market risk' in Note P2 'Risk and liquidity management' (the Market risk section) and Note P21 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'. The risk of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities in Nordea Bank Abp's financial statements originates mainly from loans, securities and deposits with a fixed interest rate, causing interest rate risk. Changes in the fair value of derivatives as well as changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged are recognised separately in the income statement in the line item 'Net income from hedge accounting'. Given that the hedge is e/ff.ligaective, the change in the fair value of the hedged item will be o/ff.ligaset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged with the derivative instrument are reflected in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item, which is also recognised in the income statement. The fair value changes of the hedged items held at amortised cost in hedges of interest rate risks are reported separately in the balance sheet item 'Fair value changes of hedged items in hedges of interest rate risk'.\n\nFair value hedge accounting at Nordea Bank Abp is performed both at a micro level and on a portfolio basis. Any ine/ff.ligaectiveness is recognised in the income statement under the item 'Net result from hedge accounting'.\n\n## Hedged items\n\nA hedged item in a fair value hedge can be a recognised single asset or liability, an unrecognised firm commitment or a portion thereof. The hedged item can also be a group of assets, liabilities or firm commitments with similar risk characteristics. Hedged items at Nordea Bank Abp consist of both individual assets or liabilities and portfolios of assets and/or liabilities.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\nThe hedging instruments used at Nordea Bank Abp are predominantly interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, which are always held at fair value.\n\n## Hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness\n\nWhen assessing hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness retrospectively, Nordea Bank Abp measures the fair value of a hedging instrument and compares the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to the change in the fair value of the hedged item.",

        "page_content": "## P1.  Accounting policies, cont.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaectiveness measurement is made on a cumulative basis.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued. For fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss and the change in the fair value of the hedged item, up to the point when the hedge relationship is terminated, is amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the hedged item.\n\nHedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness can arise from:\n\n- \u00b7 di/ff.ligaerences in timing of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 di/ff.ligaerent interest rate curves applied to discount the hedged items and hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 the e/ff.ligaect of changes in Nordea Bank Abp's or a counterparty's credit risk on the fair value of the hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 disparity between expected and actual prepayments of the loan portfolio.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nIn accordance with Nordea's risk management policies set out in section 'Market risk' in Note P2 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note P21 'Derivatives and hedge accounting', cash flow hedge accounting is applied when hedging the exposure to variability in future interest payments on instruments with variable interest rates as well as currency exposures. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, determined to be an e/ff.ligaective hedge, is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. The ine/ff.ligaective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recycled to the item 'Net result from hedge accounting' in the income statement.\n\nGains or losses on hedging instruments recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recycled and recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item a/ff.ligaects profit or loss, normally in the period that interest income or interest expense is recognised.\n\n## Hedged items\n\nA hedged item in a cash flow hedge can be highly probable floating interest rate cash flows from recognised assets or liabilities or from future assets or liabilities. Nordea Bank Abp uses cash flow hedges when hedging currency risk on future payments of interest and principal (from issued debt in in foreign currency) and when hedging interest rate risk on lending with floating interest rates.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\nThe hedging instruments used at  Nordea Bank Abp are predominantly cross currency interest rate swaps, which are always held at fair value, where the currency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of currency risk and the interest component as a fair value hedge of interest rate risk. When hedging the interest rate risk on lending with floating interest rates Nordea Bank Abp uses interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments, which are always held at fair value.\n\n## Hedge e/ff.ligaectiveness\n\nThe hypothetical derivative method is used when measuring the e/ff.ligaectiveness retrospectively of cash flow hedges, meaning that the change in a perfect hypothetical swap is used as proxy for the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows from the hedged transaction (the currency component).\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued.\n\nChanges in the unrealised value of the hedging instrument will prospectively from the last time it was proven e/ff.ligaective be accounted for in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity from the period when the hedge was e/ff.ligaective is reclassified from equity to 'Net result from hedge accounting' in the income statement if the expected transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nIf the expected transaction is no longer highly probable, but is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity from the period when the hedge was e/ff.ligaective will remain in the cash flow hedge reserve until the transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.\n\nThe possible sources of ine/ff.ligaectiveness for cash flow hedges are generally the same as for those for fair value hedges described above. However, for cash flow hedges, prepayment risk is less relevant, and the causes of hedging ine/ff.ligaectiveness arise from the changes in the timing and the amount of forecast future cash flows.\n\n## /eight.osf. Determination of fair value of financial instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that at the measurement date would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe existence of published price quotations in an active market is the best evidence of fair value and when they exist, they are used to measure financial assets and financial liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with su/ffi.ligacient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The absolute level of liquidity and volume required for a market to be considered active varies depending on the class of instruments. For some classes low price volatility is seen, also for those instruments within the class where the trade frequency is high. For instruments in such a class the liquidity requirements are lower and, correspondingly, the age limit for the prices used to establish fair value is higher.\n\nThe trade frequency and volume are monitored regularly in order to assess if markets are active or not active. Nordea Bank Abp predominantly uses published price quotations to establish fair value for items disclosed under the following balance sheet items:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks\n- \u00b7 Interest-bearing securities\n- \u00b7 Shares (listed)\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (listed).\n\nIf quoted prices for a financial instrument fail to represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions or if quoted prices are not available, fair value is established by using an appropriate valuation technique. The adequacy of the valuation technique, including an assessment of whether to use quoted prices or theoretical prices, is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nValuation techniques can range from a simple discounted cash flow analysis to complex option pricing models. Valuation models are designed to apply observable market prices and rates as input whenever possible but can also make use of unobservable model parameters. The adequacy of the valuation model is assessed by measuring its ability to match market prices. This is done by comparing calculated prices with relevant benchmark data, e.g. quoted prices from",

Accounting policies, cont.\n\nexchanges, the counterparty's valuations, price data from consensus services etc.\n\nNordea Bank Abp predominantly uses valuation techniques to establish fair value for items disclosed under the following balance sheet items:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks (when quoted prices in an active market are not available)\n- \u00b7 Interest-bearing securities (when quoted prices in an active market are not available)\n- \u00b7 Shares (when quoted prices in an active market are not available)\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (OTC derivatives).\n\nFor financial instruments whose fair value is estimated by a valuation technique, it is investigated whether the variables used in the valuation model are predominantly based on data from observable markets. Nordea Bank Abp considers data from observable markets to be data that can be collected from generally available external sources and which is deemed to represent realistic market prices. If unobservable data has a significant impact on the valuation, the instrument cannot be recognised initially at the fair value estimated by the valuation technique and any upfront gains are thereby deferred and amortised through the income statement over the contractual life of the instrument. The deferred upfront gains are subsequently released to income if the unobservable data becomes observable.\n\nNote P41 'Assets and liabilities at fair value' provides a breakdown of the fair value of financial instruments measured on the basis of:\n\n- \u00b7 quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (Level 1)\n- \u00b7 a valuation technique using observable data (Level 2) and\n- \u00b7 a valuation technique using unobservable data (Level 3).\n\nThe valuation models applied by Nordea Bank Abp are consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments and incorporate the factors that market participants consider when setting a price.\n\nNew valuation models are subject to approval by the Model Risk Committee and all models are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nFor further information, see Note P41 'Assets and liabilities at fair value'.\n\n## /nine.osf. Cash and balances with central banks\n\nCash comprises legal tender and bank notes in foreign currencies. Balances with central banks consist of deposits in accounts with central banks and postal giro systems under government authority when the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- \u00b7 The central bank or the postal giro system is domiciled in the country where the institutions are established.\n- \u00b7 The balance is readily available at any time.\n\n## /one.osf/zero.osf. Debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks\n\nDebt securities eligible as collateral in central bank monetary operations are recognised as 'Debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks'. Debt securities are recognised in this line item based on the nature of the securities and not based on whether the entity itself is eligible for refinancing with central banks.\n\nDebt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks can be classified as financial assets as amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## /one.osf/one.osf. Financial instruments\n\n## Classification of financial instruments\n\nEach financial instrument has been classified into one of the following categories:\n\n## Financial assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss:\n- - Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n- -  Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss:\n- -  Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n- -  Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option).\n\nThe classification of a financial asset is dependent on the business model for the portfolio in which the instrument is included and on whether the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI).\n\nFinancial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) are measured at fair value through profit or loss. All other assets are classified based on the business model. Instruments included in a portfolio with a business model where the intention is to keep the instruments and collect contractual cash flows are measured at amortised cost. Instruments included in a business model where the intention is both to keep the instruments to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the instruments are measured at fair value through the fair value reserve in equity. Financial assets included in any other business model are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn order to determine the business model, Nordea Bank Abp has divided its financial assets into portfolios and/or subportfolios based on how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. When determining the right level for the portfolios, Nordea Bank Abp has taken the current business area structure into account. When determining the business model for each portfolio, Nordea Bank Abp  has analysed the objective for the financial assets as well as, for instance, past sales behaviour and management compensation.\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. The classification of financial instruments into different categories forms the basis for how each instrument is subsequently measured on the balance sheet and how changes in its value are recognised. In the table in Note P40 'Classification of financial instruments', the classification of the financial instruments on Nordea Bank Abp's balance sheet into the di/ff.ligaerent categories under IFRS 9 is presented.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the instruments within this category are measured at amortised cost. In an amortised cost measurement, the di/ff.ligaerence between acquisition cost and redemption value is amortised in the income statement over the remaining term using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method. Amortised cost is defined as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repay-",

For more information about the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method see section 'Net interest income'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see section 12 below.\n\nInterest on assets and liabilities classified at amortised cost is recognised in the line items 'Interest income' and 'Interest expense' in the income statement.\n\nThis category mainly consists of all loans and deposits, except for reverse repurchase/repurchase agreements and securities borrowing/lending agreements in Markets. This category also includes subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue, except for issued structured bonds issued by Markets.\n\n## Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs. All changes in fair value are recognised directly in the income statement in the item 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing'.\n\nThe category consists of two sub-categories: 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss' and 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)'.\n\nThe sub-category 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss' mainly contains all assets in Markets, trading liabilities in Markets, interest-bearing securities included in part of the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer, derivative instruments, shares and assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts. Deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts are contracts with customers and policyholders where the total risk is born by the policyholders.  The deposits are invested in di/ff.ligaerent types of financial assets on behalf of customers and policyholders.\n\nAlso, assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts that are not mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss are classified into the category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss'. The value of these deposits is directly linked to assets in the contacts and changes in own credit risk consequently have no impact on these contracts.\n\nNordea Bank Abp also applies the fair value option on structured bonds issued by Markets as these instruments include embedded derivatives not closely related to the host contract. The change in the fair value of these issued structured bonds is recognised in profit or loss except for the changes in credit risk that are recognised through  the fair value reserve in equity.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value through profit or loss in Markets are classified as 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing'.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. This category mainly consists of the interest-bearing securities included in part of the liquidity bu/ff.ligaer. Changes in fair value, except for interest, foreign exchange e/ff.ligaects and impairment losses, are recognised in the fair value reserve in equity. Interest is recognised in the item 'Interest income', foreign exchange e/ff.ligaects in 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' and impairment losses in the item 'Impairment of other financial assets'  in the income\n\nstatement. When an instrument is disposed of, the fair value changes previously accumulated in the fair value reserve are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the item 'Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see section 12 below.\n\n## Hybrid (combined) financial instruments\n\nHybrid (combined) financial instruments are contracts containing a host contract and an embedded derivative instrument. Such combinations arise predominantly from the issuance of structured debt instruments, such as issued indexlinked bonds and loans with embedded collars and caps.\n\nOther structured bonds issued by Markets, Nordea Bank Abp applies the fair value option and the entire combined instrument, the host contract together with the embedded derivative, is measured at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the item 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing' and presented as 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet.\n\n## Securities borrowing and lending agreements\n\nGenerally, securities borrowing and securities lending transactions are entered into on a collateralised basis. Unless the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, the securities are not recognised on or derecognised from the balance sheet. Securities in securities lending transactions are disclosed in Note P43 'Transferred assets and obtained collateral' and securities pledged as security in securities lending in Note P36 'Assets pledged as security for own liabilities'.\n\nCash collateral advanced (securities borrowing) to counterparties is recognised on the balance sheet as 'Loans to credit institutions' or 'Loans to the public'. Cash collateral received (securities lending) from counterparties is recognised on the balance sheet as 'Deposits by credit institutions and central banks' or 'Deposits and borrowings from the public'.\n\n## Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements\n\nSecurities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities received under reverse repurchase agreements are not derecognised from or recognised on the balance sheet.\n\nSecurities delivered under repurchase agreements are disclosed in Note P43 'Transferred assets and obtained collateral'. Cash received under repurchase agreements is recognised on the balance sheet as 'Deposits by credit institutions and central banks' or 'Deposits and borrowings from the public'. Liabilities recognised from repurchase agreements are disclosed in Note P43 'Transferred assets and obtained collateral'.\n\nCash delivered under reverse repurchase agreements is recognised on the balance sheet as 'Loans to credit institutions' or 'Loans to the public'.\n\nA sale of a security not owned by Nordea Bank Abp is defined as a short sale and triggers the recognition of a trading liability (Sold, not held securities) presented as 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. The short sale is generally covered through a Securities Financing Transaction (SFT), normally a reverse repurchase agreement or other forms of securities borrowing agreements.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAll derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. Derivatives with a positive fair value, including any accrued interest, are recognised as assets in the item 'Derivatives' on the asset side. Derivatives with a nega-",

Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities against central counterparty clearing houses are o/ff.ligaset on the balance sheet if the transaction currency and the central counterparty are the same. Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities related to bilateral OTC derivative transactions are not o/ff.ligaset on the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase transaction with CCP are o/ff.ligaset on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same central counterparty, are settled in the same currency and have the same maturity date. Loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions that are made in accordance with the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) are o/ff.ligaset on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same counterparty, are settled in the same currency, have the same maturity date and are settled through the same settlement institution.\n\n## Issued debt and equity instruments\n\nA financial instrument issued by Nordea Bank Abp is either classified as a financial liability or equity. Issued financial instruments are classified as a financial liability if the contractual arrangement results in Nordea Bank Abp having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments to the holder of the instrument. If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and classified as equity. Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.\n\n## /one.osf/two.osf. Loans to the public/credit institutions Scope\n\nFinancial instruments classified as 'Amortised cost' or 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are subject to impairment testing due to credit risk. This includes assets recognised on the balance sheet as 'Cash and balances with central banks', 'Debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions', 'Loans to the public' and 'Interest-bearing securities'. These balance sheet line items include assets classified as 'Fair value through profit or loss', which are not subject to impairment testing. See section 11 above and Note P40 'Classification of financial instruments'.\n\nO/ff.liga-balance sheet commitments, contingent liabilities and loan commitments are also subject to impairment testing.\n\n## Recognition and presentation\n\nAmortised cost assets are recognised gross with an o/ff.ligasetting allowance for the expected credit losses if the loss is not regarded as final. The allowance account is disclosed net on\n\nthe face of the balance sheet, but the allowance account is disclosed separately in the notes. Changes in the allowance account are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nIf the impairment loss is regarded as final, it is reported as a realised loss and the carrying amount of the loan and the related allowance for impairment loss are derecognised. An impairment loss is regarded as final when the obligor has filed for bankruptcy and the administrator has declared the economic outcome of the bankruptcy procedure, or when Nordea Bank Abp waives its claims either through a legally based or voluntary reconstruction, or when Nordea Bank Abp, for other reasons, deems it unlikely that the claim will be recovered. See also section 'Write-o/ff.ligas' below.\n\nProvisions for o/ff.liga-balance sheet exposures are classified as 'Provisions' on the balance sheet, with changes in provisions classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nAssets classified as 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet. Impairment losses calculated in accordance with IFRS 9 are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Impairment of other financial assets'. Any fair value adjustments are recognised in equity.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nNordea Bank Abp classifies all exposures into stages on an individual basis. Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 (impaired loans) includes defaulted assets. Nordea Bank Abp monitors whether there are indicators of exposures being credit impaired (stage 3) by identifying events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows (loss event). Nordea Bank Abp applies the same definition of default as the Capital Requirements Regulation. More information on the identification of loss events can be found in Note P2 'Risk and liquidity management'. Exposures without individually calculated allowances will be covered by the model-based impairment calculation.\n\nFor significant exposures where a credit event has been identified, the exposure is tested for impairment on an individual basis. If the exposure is found impaired, an individual provision is recognised. The carrying amount of the exposure is compared with the sum of the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the carrying amount is higher, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss. The expected cash flows are discounted with the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate and include the fair value of the collateral and other credit enhancements. The estimate is based on three di/ff.ligaerent forward-looking scenarios that are probability weighted to derive the net present value.\n\nFor insignificant exposures that have been individually identified as credit impaired, the impairment loss is measured using the model described below but based on the fact that the exposures are already in default.\n\n## Model-based allowance calculation\n\nFor exposures not impaired on an individual basis, a statistical model is used for calculating impairment losses. The provisions are calculated as the exposure at default times the probability of default (PD) times the loss given default. For assets in stage 1 this calculation is only based on the coming 12 months, while for assets in stages 2 and 3 it is based on the expected lifetime of the asset.\n\nThe provisions for exposures for which there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are",

Provisions for exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but that are not credit impaired, are based on the lifetime expected losses (stage 2). This is also the case for the insignificant credit impaired exposures in stage 3.\n\nNordea Bank Abp uses two di/ff.ligaerent models to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. For assets held at transition on 1 January 2018, the change in internal rating and scoring data is used to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. Internal rating/scoring information is used to assess the risk of the customers and a deterioration in rating/ scoring indicates an increase in the credit risk of the customer. Nordea Bank Abp has concluded that it is not possible to calculate the lifetime PD at origination without the use of hindsight for assets already recognised on the balance sheet at transition. Changes to the lifetime PD are used as the trigger for assets recognised after transition.\n\nFor assets evaluated based on lifetime PD, Nordea Bank Abp uses a mix of absolute and relative changes in PD as the transfer criterion:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 1%: Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 45bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or\n- equal to 1%: Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 300bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 20bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 0.5%: Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 400bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7\n\nFor assets for which rating and scoring models are used, the change in rating/scoring notches is calibrated to match the significant increase in credit risk based on lifetime PD. In addition, customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to stage 2 unless already identified as credit impaired (stage 3). Exposures with forbearance measures will stay in stage 2 for a probation period of 24 months from when the measures were introduced. Once transferred back to stage 1, after the probation period, the exposures are treated as any other stage 1 exposure when assessing significant increase in credit risk. Exposures more than 90 days past due will normally be classified as stage 3, but this classification will be rebutted if there is evidence that the customer is not in default. Such exposures will be classified as stage 2. Rated exposures classified as 'high risk', i.e. with a rating grade of 2 or below will also be transferred to stage 2.\n\nNordea Bank Abp does not use the 'low credit risk exemption' in its banking operations.\n\nWhen calculating provisions, including the staging assessment, the calculation is based on probability-weighted forward looking information. Nordea Bank Abp applies three macroeconomic scenarios to address the non-linearity in expected credit losses. The di/ff.ligaerent scenarios are used to adjust the relevant parameters for calculating expected losses\n\nand a probability-weighted average of the expected losses under each scenario is recognised as provisions. The model is based on data collected before the reporting date requiring Nordea Bank Abp to identify events that may a/ff.ligaect the provisions after the data is sourced to the model calculation. Management evaluates these events and adjusts the provisions if deemed necessary.\n\n## Write-o/ff.ligas\n\nA write-o/ff.liga is a derecognition of a loan or receivable from the balance sheet and a final realisation of a credit loss provision. When assets are considered as uncollectable, they should be written o/ff.liga as soon as possible, regardless of whether the legal claim remains or not. A write-o/ff.liga can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded in full. Although an uncollectable asset is removed or written o/ff.liga from the balance sheet, the customer remains legally obligated to pay the outstanding debt. When assessing the recoverability of non-performing loans and determining if write-o/ff.ligas are required, exposures with the following characteristics are in particular focus (the list is not exhaustive):\n\n- \u00b7 Exposures past due more than 90 days. If, following this assessment, an exposure or part of an exposure is deemed as unrecoverable, it is written o/ff.liga.\n- \u00b7 Exposures under insolvency procedure where the collateralisation of the exposure is low.\n- \u00b7 Exposures where legal expenses are expected to absorb the proceeds from the bankruptcy procedure, and estimated recoveries are therefore expected to be low.\n- \u00b7 A partial write-o/ff.liga may be warranted where there is reasonable financial evidence to demonstrate an inability of the borrower to repay the full amount, i.e. a significant level of debt which cannot be reasonably demonstrated to be recoverable following forbearance treatment and/or the execution of collateral.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring cases.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate used to measure impairment is the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate for loans attached to an individual customer or, if applicable, to a group of loans. If considered appropriate, the discount rate can be based on a method that results in an impairment that is a reasonable approximation of using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method as basis for the calculation.\n\n## Restructured loans and modifications\n\nIn this context a restructured loan is defined as a loan where Nordea Bank Abp has granted concessions to the obligor due to their financial di/ffi.ligaculties and where this concession has resulted in an impairment loss for Nordea Bank Abp. After a reconstruction the loan is normally regarded as not impaired if it performs according to the new conditions. In the event of a recovery, the payment is reported as a recovery of loan losses.\n\nModifications of the contractual cash flows for loans to customers in financial di/ffi.ligaculties (forbearance) reduce the gross carrying amount of the loan. Normally this reduction is less than the existing provision and no loss is recognised in the income statement due to modifications. If significant, the gross amounts (loan and allowance) are reduced.\n\n## Assets taken over for protection of claims\n\nIn a financial reconstruction the creditor may concede loans to the obligor and in exchange for this concession acquires an asset pledged for the conceded loans, shares issued by the obligor or other assets.

For example, a property taken over, not held for Nordea Bank Abp's own use, is reported together with other investment properties.\n\nAt initial recognition, all assets taken over for protection of claims are recognised at fair value and the possible di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount of the loan and the fair value of the assets taken over is recognised as 'Net loan losses'. The fair value of the asset on the date of recognition becomes its cost or amortised cost value, as applicable. In subsequent periods, assets taken over for protection of claims are valued in accordance with the valuation principles for the appropriate type of asset. Investment properties are then measured at fair value. Financial assets that are foreclosed are generally classified into the category 'Fair value through profit or loss' and measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in line item 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing'.\n\nAny change in value, after the initial recognition of the asset taken over, is presented in the income statement in line with the presentation policies for the appropriate asset. The line item 'Net loan losses' in the income statement is, after the initial recognition of the asset taken over, consequently not a/ff.ligaected by any subsequent remeasurement of the asset.\n\n## /one.osf/three.osf. Leasing\n\n## Leases\n\nLeases are not recognised on Nordea Bank Abp's balance sheet. Lease payments are recognised as expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic way better reflects the time pattern of Nordea Bank Abp's benefit. The lease terms normally range between 3 to 25 years. Leases are mainly related to o/ffi.ligace premises contracts and o/ffi.ligace equipment contracts normal to the business. Future minimum lease payments for noncancellable leases are presented in Note P24 'Leasing'.\n\n## /one.osf/four.osf. Investments in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures\n\nGroup undertakings are the entities that Nordea Bank Abp controls. Control is generally achieved when Nordea Bank Abp, holds directly or indirectly through group undertakings, more than 50% of the voting rights. Associated undertakings are the entities where Nordea Bank Abp's share of voting rights is between 20% and 50% and/or where Nordea Bank Abp has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. Joint ventures are the entities where Nordea Bank Abp has joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's investments in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures are recognised under the cost model. At each balance sheet date, all shares in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures are reviewed for indications of impairment. If such indication exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of each holding of shares is fully recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Any impairment charge is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount and is presented in the line item 'Impairment losses of other financial assets' in the income statement.\n\nNordea Bank Abp applies fair value hedge accounting for the foreign exchange risk in its investments in foreign operations. Under fair value hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss along with the associated movement in the foreign currency risk on the designated portion of the investment in foreign operations. All changes in the fair value of the hedged item and hedging instruments are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing'. Exchange di/ff.ligaerences arising on internal long-term loans to foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the future are recognised in equity and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the investment.\n\n## /one.osf/five.osf. Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are identifiable, non-monetary assets without physical substance. The assets are under Nordea Bank Abp's control, which means that Nordea Bank Abp has the power and rights to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource. Nordea Bank Abp's intangible assets mainly consist of goodwill, IT development and computer software.\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are recognised at cost less amortisation and any write-downs. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which is normally 5-10 years for goodwill and 3-5 years for IT development and computer software and in some circumstances for strategic infrastructure up to a maximum of 10 years. The useful lives of assets are reassessed on a yearly basis. Amortisation and write-downs of intangible assets are presented in 'Depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges of tangible and intangible assets' in the income statement.\n\nGoodwill is typically recognised when Nordea Bank Abp acquires an asset or business or in connection with the merger of a subsidiary.\n\n## IT development and computer software\n\nCosts associated with maintaining computer software programs are expensed as incurred. Costs directly associated with major software development investments, with the ability to generate future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets. These costs include software development sta/ff.liga costs and overhead expenditures directly attributable to preparing the asset for use. Computer software also includes acquired software licences not related to the function of a tangible asset.\n\n## Impairment\n\nIT development not yet taken into use is not amortised but tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indications of impairment. Impairment testing is also performed more frequently if required due to any indication of impairment. The impairment charge is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, all intangible assets with definite useful lives, including IT development taken into use, are reviewed for indications of impairment. If such indications exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the intangible asset is fully recoverable.\n\n## /one.osf/six.osf. Properties and equipment\n\nProperties and equipment include properties for own use, leasehold improvements, IT equipment, furniture and other equipment.

The estimates of the useful life of di/ff.ligaerent assets are reassessed on a yearly basis. Below follow the current estimates:\n\n| Buildings               | 30-75 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Equipment               | 3-5 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Leasehold  improvements | Changes within buildings the shorter of  10 years and the remaining lease term.  New construction the shorter of the  principles used for owned buildings  and the remaining lease term. Fixtures  installed in leased properties are depre- ciated over the shorter of 10-20 years  and the remaining lease term. |\n\nAt each balance sheet date, Nordea Bank Abp assesses whether there is any indication that an item of property and equipment may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated, and any impairment loss is recognised.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\n## /one.osf/seven.osf. Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are primarily properties held to earn rent and/or for capital appreciation. Nordea Bank Abp applies the fair value model for subsequent measurement of investment properties. The best evidence of fair value is normally quoted prices in an active market for similar properties in the same location and condition. As these prices are rarely available, discounted cash flow projection models based on reliable estimates of future cash flows are also used.\n\nNet rental income, gains and losses as well as fair value adjustments are recognised directly in the income statement as 'Net result from investment properties'.\n\n## /one.osf/eight.osf. Assets and deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts\n\nDeposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts are contracts with customers and policyholders where the total risk is born by the customers or the policyholders. The deposits are invested in di/ff.ligaerent types of financial assets on behalf of the customers and policyholders.\n\nUnit-linked investment contracts include investment contracts written without any investment guarantees and which do not transfer su/ffi.ligacient insurance risk to be classified as insurance contracts.. The assets and deposits under these contracts are recognised and measured at fair value as described in section 11 'Financial instruments' above.\n\n## /one.osf/nine.osf. Taxes\n\nThe line item 'Income tax expense' in the income statement comprises current and deferred income tax. The income tax expense is recognised in the income statement unless the tax e/ff.ligaect relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax e/ff.ligaect is recognised in the applicable line item included in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax expense on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, using the balance sheet method, for temporary di/ff.ligaerences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary di/ff.ligaerences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary di/ff.ligaerences, tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nTax positions are regularly reviewed to identify situations where it is not probable that the relevant tax authorities will accept the treatment used in the tax filings. Uncertain tax positions are considered independently or as a group, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. If Nordea Bank Abp concludes that it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the e/ff.ligaect of uncertainty is reflected when determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. This is done by using either the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method better predicts the outcome of the uncertainty. Uncertain tax treatment can a/ff.ligaect both current tax and deferred tax.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are o/ff.ligaset when the legal right to o/ff.ligaset exists and Nordea Bank Abp intends to either settle the tax asset and the tax liability net or recover the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally o/ff.ligaset if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ff.ligaset current tax assets and current tax liabilities.\n\n## /two.osf/zero.osf. Employee benefits\n\nAll forms of consideration given by Nordea Bank Abp to its employees as compensation for services performed are employee benefits. Short-term benefits are to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period when the services have been performed. Post-employment benefits are benefits payable after termination of the employment. Postemployment benefits in Nordea Bank Abp consist only of pensions. Termination benefits normally arise if employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or if an employee accepts an o/ff.ligaer of voluntary redundancy.\n\n## Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. Both fixed and variable salaries are expensed in the period when the employees have performed services to Nordea Bank Abp. Nordea Bank Abp has also issued share-based payment programmes, which are further described in section 24 'Share-based payment'.\n\nMore information can be found in Note P9 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.",

Accounting policies, cont.\n\n## Post-employment benefits Pension plans\n\nNordea Bank Abp has various pension plans, consisting of both defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans, reflecting national practices and conditions in the countries where Nordea Bank Abp operates. Defined benefit pension plans are predominantly sponsored in Sweden, Norway and Finland. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded schemes covered by assets in pension funds/foundations. If the fair value of plan assets, associated with a specific pension plan, is lower than the gross present value of the defined benefit obligation determined using the projected unit credit method, the net amount is recognised as a liability ('Retirement benefit liabilities'). If not, the net amount is recognised as an asset ('Retirement benefit assets'). Non-funded pension plans are recognised as 'Retirement benefit liabilities'.\n\nMost pensions in Denmark, but also plans in other countries, are based on defined contribution arrangements that hold no pension liability for Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nAll defined benefit pension plans are closed for new employees. Nordea Bank Abp also contributes to public pension systems.\n\n## Pension costs\n\nObligations for defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense as the employee renders services to the entity and the contribution payable in exchange for that service becomes due. Nordea Bank Abp's net obligation for defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Actuarial calculations, including the projected unit credit method, are applied to assess the present value of defined benefit obligations and related costs, based on several actuarial and financial assumptions (as disclosed in Note P33 'Retirement benefit obligations').\n\nWhen establishing the present value of the obligation and the fair value of any plan assets, remeasurement e/ff.ligaects may arise as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience e/ff.ligaects (actual outcome compared to assumptions). The remeasurement e/ff.ligaects are recognised immediately in equity through the fair value reserve.\n\nWhen the calculation the results in a benefit, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nSocial security contributions are calculated and accounted for based on the net recognised surplus or deficit by plan and are included on the balance sheet as 'Retirement benefit liabilities' or 'Retirement benefit assets'.\n\n## Discount rate in defined benefit pension plans\n\nThe discount rate is determined by reference to high-quality corporate bonds where a deep enough market for such bonds exists. Covered bonds are in this context considered to be corporate bonds. In countries where no such market exists, the discount rate is determined by reference to government bond yields. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark the discount rate is determined with reference to covered bonds and in Finland with reference to corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark the observed covered bond credit spreads over the swap curve are derived from the most liquid long-dated covered bonds and extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the relevant swap curves. In Fin-\n\nland the corporate bond credit spread over the government bond rate is extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligation using the government bond curve.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nAs mentioned above, termination benefits normally arise if employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or if an employee accepts an o/ff.ligaer of voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits do not arise if the employees have to continue performing services and the termination benefits can be considered to be normal compensation for those services.\n\nTermination benefits are expensed when Nordea Bank Abp has an obligation to make the payment. An obligation arises when there is a formal plan committed to on the appropriate organisational level and when Nordea Bank Abp is without realistic possibility of withdrawal, which normally occurs when the plan has been communicated to the group a/ff.ligaected or to their representatives.\n\nTermination benefits can include both short-term benefits, for instance a number of months' salary, and post-employment benefits, normally in the form of early retirement. Shortterm benefits are classified as 'Salaries and remuneration' and post-employment benefits as 'Pension costs' in Note P9 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.\n\n## /two.osf/one.osf. Equity\n\n## Additional Tier 1 capital holders\n\nNordea Bank Abp has issued perpetual subordinated instruments where the interest payments to the holders are at the discretion of Nordea Bank Abp and non-accumulating. Some of these instruments also include a requirement for Nordea Bank Abp to pay interest if the instruments are no longer allowed to be included in Tier 1 capital. If there is a requirement to pay interest based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of an uncertain future event that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instrument, the instrument is classified as a financial liability. The inclusion of the subordinated loan in Tier 1 capital is decided by the regulators and is thus beyond the control of Nordea Bank Abp and the holders of the instrument. Nordea Bank Abp classifies the instruments as financial liabilities. Instruments without such clauses are classified as equity as there is no requirement for Nordea Bank Abp to pay interest or principal to the holders of the instruments.\n\nNordea Bank Abp determines payments on financial instrument classified as equity (i.e. Additional Tier 1 instruments) as distribution of profits and for that reason such payments are accounted for as dividends.\n\n## Invested unrestricted equity\n\nInvested unrestricted equity consists of the subscription price of the shares in Nordea Bank Abp's share issue or rights issue which has not been recorded in 'Share capital'. For acquisitions and sales of own shares, see section 21 'Treasury shares'.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nOther reserves comprise revaluation reserve and fair value reserve.\n\nFair value reserves include reserves for cash flow hedges, fair value measurement of financial assets classified into the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' and accumulated remeasurements of defined benefit pension plans as well as a reserve for translation di/ff.ligaerences.",

Accounting policies, cont.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings include the undistributed profit from the previous years.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are not accounted for as assets, but as a reduction of equity. Acquisitions of treasury shares as part of the Markets trading operations are recognised as a reduction in 'Invested unrestricted equity' and sales of own shares in the trading operations as an increase in 'Invested unrestricted equity'. Treasury shares acquired to optimise the capital structure are recognised as a reduction in 'Retained earnings'. There is no impact on the financial statements when shares are cancelled. Transaction costs related to repurchasing of treasury shares are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Other operating expenses'.\n\nContracts on Nordea shares that can be settled net in cash, i.e. derivatives such as options and warrants and their equivalents, are either presented as financial assets or financial liabilities.\n\n## /two.osf/two.osf. Provisions\n\nProvisions (which are presented as a liability) are recognised when Nordea Bank Abp has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event if it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\nProvisions relating to employee benefits are further described in section 20 and provisions relating to financial guarantee contracts and to credit commitments are described in section 23.\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognised as liabilities on the balance sheet but disclosed in Note P38 'Contingent liabilities' unless the possibility of an outflow is remote. A contingent liability is a possible obligation whose existence will be confirmed only by future event(s) not wholly within Nordea Bank Abp's control or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with su/ffi.ligacient reliability.\n\n## /two.osf/three.osf. Financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments\n\nUpon initial recognition, premiums received in issued financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments are recognised as prepaid income on the balance sheet. The guarantees and irrevocable credit commitments are subsequently measured, and recognised as a provision on the balance sheet, at the higher of either the fee received less amortisation, or an amount calculated in accordance with IFRS 9. Changes in provisions are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net loan losses'.\n\nPremiums received for financial guarantees are, as stated in section 3 'Recognition of operating income', amortised over the guarantee period and recognised as 'Fee and commission income' in the income statement. Premiums received on credit commitments are generally amortised over the loan commitment period. The contractual amounts are recognised o/ff.liga-balance sheet, net of any provisions. Financial guarantees are disclosed in the item 'Contingent liabilities' and irrevocable credit commitments in the item 'Commitments'.\n\n## /two.osf/four.osf. Share-based payment\n\n## Equity-settled programmes\n\nNordea Bank Abp has annually issued programmes where employees participating in these programmes are granted share-based equity-settled rights, i.e. rights to receive shares for free or to acquire shares in Nordea Bank Abp at a significant discount compared to the share price at grant date.\n\nThe grant date fair value of these rights is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value per right is estimated at grant date and not subsequently updated. The vesting period is the period over which the employees have to remain in service at Nordea Bank Abp in order for their rights to vest.\n\nFor rights with non-market performance conditions, the amount expensed is the grant date fair value per right multiplied by the best estimate of rights that will eventually vest, which is reassessed at each reporting date. For rights with market performance conditions, the total fair value is estimated based on the fair value of each right times the maximum number of rights at grant date. Market conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Therefore, if all other vesting conditions (e.g. service condition) are met, Nordea Bank Abp recognises the expense for grants of equity instruments with market conditions irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied.\n\nSocial security costs are also allocated over the vesting period. The provision for social security costs is reassessed on each reporting date to ensure that the provision is based on the rights' fair value at the reporting date.\n\nFor more information see Note P9 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.\n\n## Cash-settled programmes\n\nNordea Bank Abp has to defer payment of variable salaries under the Nordic Supervisory Financial Authorities' regulations and general guidelines, as is also the case with the Executive Incentive Programme (EIP). The deferred amounts are to some extent indexed using Nordea's total shareholder return (TSR) and these programmes are cash-settled sharebased programmes.

The intention of granting forbearance for a limited time period  is  to  ensure  full  repayment  of  the  outstanding  debt.\n\nExamples of eased terms are changes in amortisation profile, repayment schedule, customer margin as well as ease of financial covenants. Forbearance is undertaken on a selective and individual basis, approved according to the powers to act. Individual loan loss provisions are recognised if necessary. Forborne exposures can be performing or nonperforming.\n\nFrom March 2020 to October 2020 Nordea supported customers a/ff.ligaected by the COVID-19 crisis by o/ff.ligaering instalmentfree periods. On 1 October 2020 Nordea ended all temporary amendments to the credit risk framework and returned to its normal forbearance registration procedures, while still continuing to support customers through the crisis.\n\nAll COVID-19-related instalment-free periods expired by the third quarter 2021.

Credit risk is measured, monitored and segmented in di/ff.ligaerent ways. On-balance lending consists of amortised cost lending and fair value lending and constitutes the major part of the credit portfolio. Amortised cost lending is the basis for impaired loans, allowances and loan losses.\n\nCredit risk in lending is measured and presented as the principal amount of on-balance sheet claims, i.e. loans to credit institutions and to the public, and o/ff.liga-balance sheet potential claims on customers and counterparties, net after allowances. Credit risk exposure also includes the risk related to derivative contracts and securities financing. The overall credit quality is solid with strongly rated customers. Close monitoring is done due to the COVID-19 crisis, but supported by the strong Nordic economies and governmental support, the credit quality remained stable during 2021.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's loans to the public increased by 2.4% to EUR 139bn in 2021 (EUR 136bn). Of the lending to the public portfolio, corporate customers accounted for 67.0% (68.8%), reverse repurchase agreements for 12.1% (8.9%), household customers for 18.4% (19.0%) and the public sector for 2.6% (3.2%). Loans to credit institutions increased to EUR 78bn at the end of 2021 (EUR 64bn).\n\n## Loans to corporate customers\n\nLoans to corporate customers at the end of 2021 amounted to EUR 110bn (EUR 106bn).

Impaired loans net, after allowances for stage 3 loans, amount to EUR 1,355m, corresponding to 67bp of total loans. On balance allowances for stage 3 loans amount to EUR 1,375m. On balance allowances for stages 1 and 2 loans amount to EUR 414m. The ratio of allowances for loans in stage 3 in relation to impaired loans is 50% and the allowance ratio for loans in stages 1 and 2 is 21bp. The decrease in impaired loans was mainly related to the Households, Financial institutions and Real estate sectors. The portfolios with the largest impaired loan amounts were in the Natural resources, Maritime and Industrials sector.\n\n## Impaired loans and ratios\n\nDefinitions, see Glossary in the Board of Directors' report.\n\n|                                                         | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross impaired loans, amort., EURm                      | 2,729  | 3,055  |\n| - of which servicing                                    | 1,458  | 1,561  |\n| - of which non-servicing                                | 1,271  | 1,494  |\n| Impairment rate, (stage 3) gross, bp                    | 136    | 166    |\n| Impairment rate, (stage 3) net, bp                      | 67     | 87     |\n| Allowances in relation to loans   in stages 1 and 2, bp | 21     | 33     |\n| Total allowance rate (stages 1, 2 and 3), bp            | 89     | 111    |\n| Allowances in relation to impaired loans  (stage 3), %  | 50     | 47     |\n\n## Past due loans\n\nPast due loans, 6 days or more, for corporate customers amounted to EUR 378m (395m), and past due loans to household totaled EUR 447m in 2021 (468m).

This was driven by stage 3 releases in Financial institutions and overall in the household portfolio. Of the change, stage 1 accounted for EUR 108m (down from 182m one year ago), stage 2 for EUR 306m (down from 405m one year ago) and stage 3 for EUR 1,375m (down from EUR 1,449m in 2020). The coverage ratio was 0.06% for stage 1 (down from 0.10% in 2020), 5.5% for stage 2 (down from 5.6% in 2020) and 50% for stage 3 (up from 47% in 2020). This was driven by a significant decrease in impaired loans, mainly related to the Danish and Finnish portfolio.\n\n## Net loan losses\n\nNet loan losses amounted to reversals of EUR 17m (from EUR 678m in 2020), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of -1bp. Reversals mainly related to the household portfolio, which saw reversals of EUR 67m mainly related to Denmark, while the corporate portfolio had net loan losses of EUR 50m mainly driven by one retail trade customer.\n\n## Net loan losses and loan loss ratios\n\n|                                                                     |   2021 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net loan losses, EURm                                               |    -17 |    678 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, amortised cost, bp                             |     -1 |     57 |\n| - of which (stage 3)                                                |     17 |     35 |\n| - of which (stages 1 and 2)                                         |    -18 |     22 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, bp/one.numr                                    |      0 |     57 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, Personal Banking, bp/one.numr                  |     -1 |     32 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, Business Banking, bp/one.numr                  |     -1 |     57 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, Large Corporates   & Institutions, bp/one.numr |     -3 |     63 |",

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## Counterparty credit risk\n\nCounterparty credit risk is the risk that Nordea Bank Abp's counterpart in an FX, interest, commodity, equity or credit derivative contract defaults prior to maturity of the contract and that Nordea Bank Abp at that time has a claim on the counterpart. Counterparty credit risk can also exist in repurchasing agreements and other securities financing transactions. The current net exposure (after close-out netting and collateral reduction) represents EUR 4.4bn, of which 32% was towards financial institutions.\n\n## Market risk\n\nPlease see section 4. 'Market risk' of Note G2 to the financial statements of the Group.\n\n## Market risk analysis\n\nThe market risk for the Nordea Bank Abp trading book is presented in the table below.\n\nThe average market risk measured by VaR was EUR 24.7m in 2021 (the average in 2020 was EUR 31.6m) and was primarily driven by interest rate risk. Stressed average VaR was EUR 38.0m in 2021 (average in 2020 was EUR 46.7m) and primarily driven by interest rate risk with additional contributions from credit spread risk. The peak in VaR was reached in the first quarter while the peak in stressed VaR was reached in the fourth quarter. VaR and stressed VaR are primarily driven by market risk in the Northern European and Nordic countries.\n\nThe Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) at the end of 2021 was slightly lower compared to the end of 2020, which was driven by reduced sovereign bond exposure. The lowest exposure\n\noccurred during the fourth quarter of 2021, while the IRC was the highest in the second quarter of 2021. The average IRC decreased marginally compared to the previous year, mainly driven by a lower contribution from the migration component.\n\nThe Comprehensive Risk Charge (CRC) at the end of 2021 was higher than at the end of 2020. The lowest exposure occurred during second quarter of 2021, while the CRC peaked during the fourth quarter of 2021. The average CRC for 2021 decreased by EUR 20.3m compared to 2020 as the average for 2020 was driven higher by peaks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Structural interest income risk (SIIR)/economic value (EV)\n\nAt the end of the year the worst loss out of the internal RAF scenarios for SIIR was driven by the RAF scenario European Debt Crisis, where the potential reduction of one year's net interest income due to interest rate movements was EUR 214m. Nordea Bank Abp's balance sheet is structured so that net interest income would decrease if interest rates fall.

Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## Compliance Risk\n\nFor compliance risk, ESG-related risk management, financial crime prevention as well as management of compliance risk please see section 6. 'Compliance Risk' of Note G2 to the financial statements of the Group.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nDuring 2021, Nordea Bank Abp continued to benefit from its prudent liquidity risk management, in terms of maintaining a diversified and strong funding base and a diversified liquidity bu/ff.ligaer. Nordea Bank Abp maintained a strong liquidity position throughout the year.\n\nNordea Bank Abp issued approximately EUR 13.7bn in long-term funding in 2021, of which all was issued in the form of senior debt.\n\nThroughout 2021, Nordea Bank Abp remained compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement in all currencies on a combined basis, as well as the net stable funding ratio (NFSR).\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea Bank Abp has participated in ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). To date, Nordea Bank Abp has borrowed EUR 12bn under the TLTRO III programme. The ECB applies a negative interest rate to the TLTRO III funding. Nordea Bank Abp accordingly recognises negative interest expense in connection with its TLTRO III borrowing. In 2021 the negative interest expense added EUR 95m (EUR 19m) to Nordea Bank Abp's net interest income. If Nordea Bank Abp's eligible lending reached a certain threshold, measured at the end of the first quarter 2021 and the end of the fourth quarter 2021, the interest rate decreased to -1% with retroactive impact. Nordea Bank Abp alters the e/ff.ligaective interest rate if the threshold is reached, and recognises the impact under net interest income. In 2021 Nordea Bank Abp reached the lending threshold at the end of the first quarter and altered the e/ff.ligaective interest rate with retroactive impact.\n\nNordea Bank Abp did not alter the e/ff.ligaective interest rate for the third and fourth quarters, as it could not yet be concluded with adequate certainty that the threshold at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 had been reached.\n\n## Liquidity risk definition and identification\n\nPlease see section 8.1. 'Liquidity risk definition and identification' of Note G2 to the financial statements of the Group.\n\n## Management principles and control\n\nPlease see section 8.2. 'Management principles and control' of Note G2 to the financial statements of the Group.\n\n## Liquidity risk management strategy\n\nPlease see section 8.3. 'Liquidity risk management strategy' of Note G2 to the financial statements of the Group.\n\n## Liquidity risk measurement\n\nPlease see the section 8.4. 'Liquidity risk measurement' of Note G2 to the financial statements of the Group.\n\n## Liquidity risk analysis\n\nNordea Bank Abp continues to have a strong and prudent liquidity risk profile with a strong funding base. As of yearend 2021, the total volume utilised under CD and CP programmes was EUR 38.2bn (EUR 33.7bn) with an average maturity of 0.4 (0.4)years. The total volume under long-term programmes was EUR 32.8bn (EUR 34bn) with an average maturity of 3.2 (2.8) years. Nordea Bank Abp's funding sources are presented in the table below.\n\nThe liquidity risk position remained at a low level throughout 2021. The liquidity stress horizon was 1095 days as of year-end 2021 (1095 days as of year-end 2020) with an annual average of 1095 days (856 days). The annual average of the funding gap risk was EUR +44.2bn (EUR +35.4bn in 2020). Nordea Bank Abp's liquidity bu/ff.ligaer ranged between EUR 82.7bn and 137.3bn throughout 2021 (EUR 79.6bn and EUR 119.9bn) with an average liquidity bu/ff.ligaer of EUR 114.3bn (EUR 94.6bn). The combined LCR according to the EBA Delegated Act rules for the Nordea Bank Abp was 148% at the end of 2021 (139%) with an annual average of 141% (153%). At the end of 2021 the LCR in EUR was 137% (234%) and in USD 169% (119%), with annual averages of 210% (195%) and 176% (200%), respectively.

For each GLT member, the indemnity is capped at an aggregate amount of EUR 37.5m, unless the Board of Directors decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis. Nordea purchases D&O insurance which provides cover for liability assumed by the bank following the indemnification undertaking.\n\n## Loans to and deposits from key management personnel\n\nLoans to key management personnel (defined in Note P1 section 25) amount to EUR 0m (EUR 0m) and interest income on these loans amounted to EUR 0m (EUR 0m). Deposits from key management personnel amounted to EUR 12m (EUR 14m) and interest on these deposit amounted to EUR 0m (EUR 0m). Loan commitments to key management personnel amounted to EUR 0m (EUR 0m).\n\nFor key management personnel employed by Nordea Bank Abp the same credit terms apply as for other employees. In Finland the employee interest rate for loans corresponds to Nordea Bank Abp's funding cost with a margin of 30 basis points. In Denmark the employee interest rate for loans is variable and was 2.25 % at 31 December 2021, but special terms are applied for car loans and mortgage loans. The interest rate on car loans without collateral is variable and was 1.50%. The interest rate on mortgage loans up to 80% of the valuation of the property was 1.50%. In Norway the variable interest rate on loans for employees was 1.40% at 31 December 2021. Mortgage loans with fixed interest rates are o/ff.ligaered with the same rates as mortgage loans to Premium customers. In Sweden the employee interest rate on fixed and variable interest rate loans is 215 basis points lower than the corresponding interest rate for external customers (with a lower limit of 50 basis points). There is currently a cap of 57 Swedish price base amounts both on fixed and variable interest rate loans. For interest on loans above the defined cap, the same terms apply as for Premium customers. Loans to family members of key management personnel are granted on normal market terms, as are loans to key management personnel who are not employed by Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nThe loan quality for the key management personnel and their family members is good with no significant increase in credit risk. Loan loss provisions for key management personnel are included in the collectively assessed allowances shown in Note 16 'Loans and impairment'.",

The terms of the programmes vary depending on the target group. Disclosures related to the share-based programmes can be found below. All remuneration programmes are also described in the section 'Remuneration' on page 83 of the Board of Directors' report and in further detail below.\n\nIn 2020, Nordea Bank Abp introduced a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for GLT members, which is an equity settled plan. For more info on this plan, see 'Long Term Incentive Plan 2020-2022' below.\n\nIn 2021, Nordea Bank Abp decided to continue the sharebased Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) implemented in 2020 for a new performance period 2021-2023. It includes the GLT members and a maximum of 50 additional senior leaders. For more info on this plan, see 'Long Term Incentive Plan 20212023' below.\n\nUntil the end of performance year 2018, Nordea's sharebased variable pay programmes were partly in the form of cash-linked total shareholder return (TSR) indexation (excluding dividends) and partly in the form of cash. The programmes were consequently all settled in cash and the portion indexed with Nordea's TSR was accounted for as a cashsettled share based payment programme.\n\nStarting from the 2019 performance year, share-based variable pay programmes are partly in the form of cash and partly in the form of Nordea shares, which makes the portion paid in Nordea shares an equity-settled share-based programme.\n\nTSR indexation may be used for share-based variable pay programmes, subject to operational, administrative or tax issues as well as applicable regulation in certain legal entities.\n\nIn 2020 EUR 13m were expensed for variable remuneration to be paid in cash and EUR 13m to be paid in shares. In 2021 these were adjusted to EUR 14m for the portion paid in cash and to EUR 11m for the portion delivered in shares. In 2021 1,579,402 shares in Nordea were allotted to the participants in these programmes, corresponding to EUR 13m based on the share price at the award date. Another 1,419,138 shares were granted to the participants but deferred. These deferred shares had a fair value of EUR 12m based on the share price at the award date.\n\nThe following table covers all programs with share-based programme expenses recognised in 2021, as well as the comparative figures for 2020. Figures for 2021 are based on expected 2021 outcome and all figures are excluding social security expenses.

Nordea Bank Abp may take positions with the expectation of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates or indices. The trading portfolio is treated as trading risk for risk management purposes. Derivatives held for risk management purposes include hedges that meet the hedge accounting requirements and hedges that are economic hedges but do not meet the hedge accounting requirements.\n\nFair value in this note represents derivatives after assets and liabilities have been set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet. Derivatives set o/ff.liga on the balance sheet are in this note presented as a reduction in derivatives held for the same purpose, i.e. derivatives used for the purpose of hedge accounting are set o/ff.liga against other derivatives used for hedge accounting and derivatives not used for hedge accounting are set o/ff.liga against other derivatives not used for hedge accounting.\n\nThe table to the right shows the fair value of derivative financial instruments together with their notional amounts. The notional amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at year end and are neither indicative of market risk nor credit risk.\n\n## Derivatives not used for hedge accounting\n\n|                                                                                 | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm                                                               | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Interest rate derivatives                                                       |              |              |                 |\n| Interest rate swaps                                                             | 16,338       | 16,901       | 3,818,963       |\n| FRAs                                                                            | 30           | 51           | 1,220,039       |\n| Futures and forwards                                                            | 26           | 37           | 83,298          |\n| Options                                                                         | 3,515        | 4,150        | 437,346         |\n| Total                                                                           | 19,909       | 21,139       | 5,559,646       |\n| Equity derivatives                                                              |              |              |                 |\n| Equity swaps                                                                    | 210          | 273          | 16,315          |\n| Futures and forwards                                                            | 1            | 1            | 1,047           |\n| Options                                                                         | 137          | 563          | 9,015           |\n| Total                                                                           | 349          | 837          | 26,378          |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives                                                    |              |              |                 |\n| Currency and interest rate swaps                                                | 5,047        | 5,736        | 375,344         |\n| Currency forwards                                                               | 3,032        | 2,544        | 382,693         |\n| Options                                                                         | 104          | 121          | 15,179          |\n| Total                                                                           | 8,183        | 8,402        | 773,216         |\n| Other derivatives                                                               |              |              |                 |\n| Credit default swaps (CDS)                                                      | 934          | 987          | 171,167         |\n| Commodity derivatives                                                           | 4            | 42           | 499             |\n| Other derivatives                                                               | 3            | 9            | 52              |\n| Total                                                                           | 941          | 1,038        | 171,718         |\n| Total derivatives not used for  hedge accounting                                | 29,382       | 31,416       | 6,530,958       |\n| -

Derivatives and hedge accounting, cont.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe hedge accounting framework and strategy used in fair value and cash flow hedges when hedging interest rate and currency risks at Nordea Bank Abp are described in more detail in 'Risk management', 'Interest rate risk' and 'Currency risk' in Note G19.\n\nHedge accounting for particular hedging strategies is consistently applied in Nordea Bank Abp's financial statements. These hedge accounting are applied in accordance with the relevant  accounting policies used in preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements (Note G19). Foreign currency risks arise from investments in foreign operations. Foreign exchange forwards are designated as hedging instru-\n\nments to/uni00A0mitigate these risks. The net investment hedge model is applied to these foreign exchange forwards in the Group consolidated financial statements, whereas the fair value hedge model is applied to the hedged portion of investments in foreign operations in Nordea Bank Abp's financial statements. Comparative figures have been restated accordingly.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe table below presents the accumulated fair value adjustments arising from continuing hedge relationships, irrespective whether there has been a change in hedge designation during the year.\n\n## Hedged items\n\n|                                          | Interest risk 2021                                 | Interest risk 2021                                              | Interest risk 2020                                 | Interest risk 2020                                              |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EURm                                     | Carrying amount   of hedged   assets/liabilities 1 | of which accumulated  amount of fair value   hedge adjustment 2 | Carrying amount   of hedged   assets/liabilities 1 | of which accumulated  amount of fair value   hedge adjustment 2 |\n| Fair value hedges                        |                                                    |                                                                 |                                                    |                                                                 |\n| Loans to the public                      | 45,563                                             | 1                                                               | 17,838                                             | 85                                                              |\n| Interest-bearing securities/three.numr   | 14,151                                             | 0                                                               | 17,461                                             | -                                                               |\n| Assets                                   | 59,714                                             | 1                                                               | 35,299                                             | 85                                                              |\n| Deposits and borrowings from  the public | 18,109                                             | 81                                                              | 16,987                                             | 534                                                             |\n| Debt securities in issue                 | 20,582                                             | 157                                                             | 21,486                                             | 536                                                             |\n| Subordinated liabilities                 | 5,714                                              | 105                                                             | 6,587                                              | 338                                                             |\n| Liabilities                              | 44,405                                             | 342                                                             | 45,060                                             | 1,408                                                           |\n\n- 1)   The balance sheet line item 'Fair value changes of hedged items in hedges of interest rate risk' has been split between the individual rows in this column.\n- 2)   Of which all relate to continuing hedges of interest rate risk.\n- 3) This row includes the instruments presented in the balance sheet line item 'Debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks'.\n\nThe following table provides information about the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                    | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm  | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges  |              |              |                 |\n| Interest rate risk | 503          | 246          | 147,855         |\n\n|                    | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2021, EURm  | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges  |              |              |                 |\n| Interest rate risk | 1,065        | 268          | 87,785          |\n\nThe table below presents the changes in the fair value of the hedged items and the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments used as the basis for recognising ine/ff.ligaectiveness.

The premises are mainly divided into head o/ffi.ligace contracts, branch o/ffi.ligace contracts and other contracts.\n\nThe head o/ffi.ligace contracts in the di/ff.ligaerent Nordic countries generally have a fixed lease term of 10-25 years. Usually these contracts either have continuation options or are automatically prolonged unless separately terminated at the end of the lease term.\n\nBranch o/ffi.ligace contracts generally have fixed lease term of 1-10 years or are without an end date with the right to terminate. The termination clauses are generally 6-24 months. The main principle is that the premises contracts do not contain purchase options.

A bond's term to maturity can range from about one month to several years. A bond is a debt obligation issued by the borrower to the investor or lender. The investor is normally entitled to a cash payment from the issuer on the maturity date. During the term to maturity, coupon payments are normally made at fixed intervals, but a bond can be issued as a 'zero coupon debt instrument' or be subject to other terms as agreed by the issuer and the investor. Bonds are often listed for trading on a stock exchange. There are senior bonds and subordinated bonds. In the event that an issuer defaults, the issuer will be required to pay the investors of senior bonds and meet all other creditor obligations in full before the issuer can make any payments on the subordinated bonds. Bonds can be issued as secured or unsecured debt.\n\nCertificates of deposit (CDs) are transferable debt securities issued by the borrower to the investor who is entitled to a cash payment from the issuer on the maturity date. CDs are not issued o/ff.liga an issuance programme and are not listed on a stock exchange. CDs usually have maturities ranging from one week to three years or longer. CDs can be issued with coupon payments or without coupon payments. CDs are issued as unsecured debt.\n\nCommercial paper (CP) is a transferable debt instrument and issued o/ff.liga an issuance programme. CP is issued with maturities ranging overnight to about one year. CP is debt owed by the issuer to the investor who is entitled to a cash payment from the issuer on the maturity date. CP is normally issued as  zero coupon debt instrument with no coupon payments during the maturity of the CP. Typically CP is not listed for trading on a stock exchange. CP is usually issued as unsecured debt.\n\n## P30.

The major plans in each country are funded schemes covered by assets in pension funds/foundations.\n\nThe plans are structured in accordance with local regulations and legislation, local practice and, where applicable, collective agreements. Nordea Bank Abp's main DBPs in Sweden, Norway and Finland are all employer-financed final salary and service-based pension plans providing pension benefits on top of the statutory systems. All DBPs are closed to new entrants, new employees are o/ff.ligaered DCPs.\n\nIn Sweden DBPs are mainly o/ff.ligaered in accordance with collective agreements and subject to the regulations of the Pension Obligations Vesting Act (Tryggandelagen). Plan assets are held in a separate pension foundation.\n\nIn Norway the DBPs are in accordance with the Nordea Bank Abp Norway occupational pension plan and subject to the Occupational Pension Act (Foretakspensjonloven). In Norway plan assets are also held in a separate pension fund.\n\nIn Finland Nordea Bank Abp provides additional pension benefits on top of the statutory system in accordance with the Nordea Finland occupational pension plan and follows the regulations of the Employees' Pension Act (TyEL). Plan assets are generally held in a separate pension foundation.\n\nMinimum funding requirements di/ff.ligaer between plans, but where such requirements are based on collective agreements or internal policies, the funding requirement is generally that the pension obligations measured using local requirements will be covered in full with a predefined surplus or alternatively safeguarded by a credit insurance contract (Sweden only). Some pension plans are not covered by funding requirements and are generally unfunded. Quarterly assessments are performed to monitor the likely level of future contributions.\n\nDBPs may impact Nordea Bank Abp via changes in the net present value of obligations and/or changes in the market value of plan assets. Changes in obligations are most importantly driven by changes in assumptions on discount rates (interest rates and credit spreads), inflation, salary increases, turnover and mortality as well as relevant experience adjustments where the actual outcome di/ff.ligaers from the assumptions.\n\nAssets are invested in diversified portfolios, with bond exposures mitigating the interest rate risk in the obligations and a fair amount of real assets (inflation protected) reducing the long-term inflationary risk in liabilities.\n\n## Multi-employer plans\n\nIn 2010 the Norwegian parliament decided to change the AFP (Avtalefestet Pensjon) plan in Norway as from 2011. The change gave rise to a new multi-employer defined benefit plan that cannot be calculated as such, as information on Nordea's share of the liabilities and pension costs in the plan is not available from Fellesordningen (the administrator). Information on the funded status of the plan is not available.\n\nThe AFP plan gives the entitled employees a lifelong addition to their regular pensions from the age of 62. Furthermore, the scheme allows employees to continue working while receiving AFP without this a/ff.ligaecting their pension rights. The plan is founded on the basis of the tripartite cooperation between employer organisations, employee organisations and the Norwegian government. The government covers one-third of the pension expense for the AFP plan, while the member companies collectively cover the remaining twothirds of the pension expense. The premium paid by the member companies to the plan is determined to be su/ffi.ligacient to cover ongoing pension expenses and provide a basis for building up a pension fund. The purpose of the pension fund is to ensure su/ffi.ligacient capital to cover expected future pension obligations.\n\nThe premium rate for 2021 was 2.5% of employees' wages between 1 and 7.1 times the average base amount according to the Norwegian National Insurance Act. The premium is calculated based on average wages and average base amounts from the previous year, excluding employees over the age of 61.\n\nThe employees that meet the requirements for AFP are guaranteed AFP payments regardless of the solvency of their employers. Consequently, the employer members have joint responsibility for two-thirds of the pensions payable to employees who at any given time meet the requirements for AFP. Any deficit or surplus in the event that the plan is wound up or entities withdraw from the plan will not have any impact on Nordea Bank Abp.\n\n## Key management personnel\n\nNordea Bank Abp's total pension obligations regarding key management personnel amounted to EUR 7m (EUR 7m) at the end of the year. Complete information concerning key management personnel is disclosed in Note P9 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.",

Consequently, Nordea Bank Abp has one class of shares (Nordea shares) and all shares in Nordea Bank Abp are ordinary shares. Each share confers one vote at Nordea Bank Abp's general meetings as well as an equal right to any dividend. Nordea Bank Abp is not entitled to vote its own shares at general meetings. The Nordea share does not have any nominal value.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting 2021, the Board of Directors was authorised to decide on the repurchase of an aggregate of not more than 500,000,000 own shares, which corresponding to approximately 12.35% of all the Nordea shares, subject to the condition that the number of own shares held by Nordea Bank Abp together with its subsidiaries at any given time do not exceed 10% of all the Nordea shares. In September 2021 Nordea Bank Abp received approval from the European Central Bank for a share buy-back of up to EUR 2.0bn. The buy-back was initiated in October and will end no later than 30 April 2022. After the financial period ending 31 December 2021, Nordea Bank Abp has further acquired 56 million shares from its shareholders. Moreover, aggregated amounts of 34,726,349 and 37,851,662 treasury shares, which were held for capital optimisation purposes and acquired through share buy-backs, were cancelled in January and February, respectively.\n\nThe AT1 conversion notes issued in 2019 and 2021 automatically convert into shares if the CET1 ratio of either the issuer on a solo basis or the Nordea Group on a consolidated basis falls below a specific trigger level.\n\nThere are no convertible bond loans issued by Nordea Bank Abp that give holders the right to exercise an option to acquire shares in Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nFor information on share-based incentive programmes, see Note P9 \"Sta/ff.liga costs\", and for information on authorisations held by the Board of Directors, see 'Share issue resolution' under 'The Nordea Shares and Ratings' in the Board of Directors report.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                    | 2021          | 2020          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Total number of   Nordea shares                                                                                                                    |               |               |\n| Total numbers of shares  at 1 January                                                                                                              | 4,049,951,919 | 4,049,951,919 |\n| Cancelled own shares during  the year                                                                                                              | -84,390,759   | -             |\n| Total number of Nordea  shares at 31 December                                                                                                      | 3,965,561,160 | 4,049,951,919 |\n| Number of outstanding  Nordea  shares                                                                                                              |               |               |\n| Number of outstanding  Nordea shares at 1 January                                                                                                  | 4,038,089,748 | 4,039,142,109 |\n| Repurchased own shares                                                                                                                             | -108,865,776  | -             |\n| Shares granted in remune- ration programmes for Nordea  Bank Abp's management                                                                      | 1,072,328     | 1,054,322     |\n| Trading portfolio and Nordea  Bank Abp's shares within  portfolio schemes in Denmark                                                               | 2,483,827     | -2,106,683    |\n| Number of outstanding  Nordea shares at 31  December                                                                                               | 3,932,780,127 | 4,038,089,748 |\n| Number of own shares                                                                                                                               | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   |\n| Holdings of own shares related  to treasury shares, trading  portfolio and Nordea Bank  Abp's shares within portfolio  schemes in Denmark/one.numr | 32,781,033    | 11,862,171    |\n| -  of which treasury shares for  remuneration purposes                                                                                             | 7,112,244     | 8,184,572     |",

Securities borrowed and then used as collateral are reported in Note P43 'Transferred assets and obtained collateral'.\n\nOther assets pledged mainly relate to interest-bearing securities pledged as security for payment settlements within central banks and clearing institutions and amounted to EUR 253m (EUR 267m).

Loan guarantees are provided for customers to guarantee obligations in other credit and pension institutions. Other guarantees mainly consist of commercial guarantees such as bid guarantees, advance payment guarantees, warranty guarantees and export-related guarantees. Contingent liabilities also include unutilised irrevocable import documentary credits and confirmed export documentary credits. These transactions are part of the bank's services and support Nordea Bank Abp's customers. Guarantees and documentary credits are o/ff.liga-balance sheet items, unless there is a need for a provision to cover a probable loan loss that arises from the judgement that reimbursement will not be received. The table above includes all issued guarantees, also those for which the possibility of an outflow of resources is considered remote.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken, in relation to certain individuals and on certain conditions, to be responsible for the potential payment liability against them in their capacity of managing directors or board members of group undertakings of Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken to indemnify the members of the GLT against legal expenses incurred in relation to legal advice in defending or disputing certain claims or investigations by third parties, excluding crimes or actions made\n\nwith intent or gross negligence. For each GLT member, the indemnity is capped at an aggregate amount of EUR 37.5m, unless the Board of Directors decides otherwise on a case-bycase basis.\n\nA limited number of employees are entitled to severance pay if they are dismissed before reaching their normal retirement age. For further information, see Note P9 'Sta/ff.liga costs'.\n\n## Claims in civil lawsuits and possible fines\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea Bank Abp faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and disputes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts, as well as possible fines due to e.g. weak anti-money laundering (AML) processes and procedures in the past. At present, none of the current disputes are considered likely to have any significant adverse e/ff.ligaect on Nordea Bank Abp or its financial position. As previousy stated, Nordea Bank Abp expects to be fined in Denmark for weak AML processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters. Nordea Bank Abp cannot exclude the possibility of fines, which could impact the bank's financial performance.\n\nIn addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation.

For structured bonds issued by Markets, changes in fair value due to changes in own credit risk are recognised in fair value reserve and Nordea Bank Abp calculates the change in its own credit spread based on the change in its funding spread by assuming the liquidity premium for the issuance to be constant over time. The change in the credit spread is estimated by comparing the value of the trades using the initial funding spread on the issuance date and the actual funding spread on the reporting date. This model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk.",

However, the section concerning loans and issued debt securities in the subsidiary Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab is not applicable to Nordea Bank Abp.\n\n## Transfers between Levels 1 and 2\n\nDuring the year Nordea Bank Abp transferred interest-bearing securities (including such financial instruments pledged as collateral) of EUR 2,356m (EUR 784m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and EUR 473m (EUR 14,161m) from Level 2 to Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.  Nordea Bank Abp also transferred\n\nother liabilities of EUR 258m (EUR 10,426m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and EUR 269m (EUR 1,040m) from Level 2 to Level 1. The reason for the transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 was that the instruments ceased to be actively traded during the year and fair values have now been obtained using valuation techniques with observable market inputs. The reason for the transfer from Level 2 to Level 1 was that the instruments have again been actively traded during the year and reliable quoted prices are obtained in the market. The main driver for the transfers during 2020 was an update to the rules for categorisation of financial instruments into Levels 1, 2 and 3. This update had a significant impact on the categorisation of 'Interest-bearing securities' and 'Debt securities in issue' where the volume and frequency of trading of the individual instruments (ISINs) were considered. Transfers between levels are considered to have occurred at the end of the year.\n\n## Movements in Level 3\n\n|                             |            | Fair value gains/losses  recognised in the income  statement and fair value  reserve during the year   | Fair value gains/losses  recognised in the income  statement and fair value  reserve during the year   | Purchases/   |       |                |        |                         |                           |                                |             |\n|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------|----------------|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|\n| 1 Jan 2021, EURm            | 1 Jan 2021 | Realised                                                                                               | Unrealised                                                                                             | issues       | Sales | Settle-  ments | Issues | Transfers  into Level 3 | Transfers out  of Level 3 | Translation  di/ff.ligaerences | 31 Dec 2021 |\n| Interest-bearing securities | 879        | -4                                                                                                     | 14                                                                                                     | 231          | -131  | 4              | -      | 40                      | -413                      | 9                              | 629         |\n| Shares and participations   | 1,128      | 10                                                                                                     | 246                                                                                                    | 104          | -147  | -              | -      | 0                       | -                         | -52                            | 1,290       |\n| Derivatives (net)           | 14         | -27                                                                                                    | 45                                                                                                     | 0            | -     | 27             | -      | -6                      | 74                        | 0                              | 128         |\n| Other assets                | 0          | -                                                                                                      | -                                                                                                      | -            | -     | -              | -      | -                       | -                         | 0                              | 0           |\n| Debt securities in issue    | 1,505      | 781                                                                                                    | -827                                                                                                   | 0            | 0     | -503           | 435    | -                       | -                         | -                              | 1,392       |\n| Other liabilities           | 32         | -11                                                                                                    | -                                                                                                      | 34           | -8    | -              | -      | -                       | -                         | 0                              | 46          |\n\nUnrealised gains and losses relate to the assets and liabilities held at the end of the year.

techniques used to estimate the fair value, significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation techniques and, for financial assets and liabilities, the fair value sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.\n\nThe column 'Range of fair value' in the tables above shows the sensitivity of the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments to changes in key assumptions. In case the exposure to an unobservable parameter is o/ff.ligaset across di/ff.ligaerent instruments, only the net impact is disclosed in the table. The range disclosed is likely to be greater than the true uncertainty in determining the fair value of these instruments as all unobservable parameters are in practice unlikely to be simultaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives. The disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.\n\nIn order to calculate the sensitivity (range) of the fair value of derivatives, a range of di/ff.ligaerent modelling approaches is applied to determine an uncertainty interval around the reported fair value. The di/ff.ligaerent approaches applied target various aspects of derivatives pricing. Two common components of derivative valuation models are the volatility of underlying risk factors and the correlation between the relevant risk factors. Each of these is addressed by applying different assumptions to input and/or the choice of modelling approach. Besides these common factors, a number of asset class-specific factors are addressed. These include equity dividend expectations, recovery assumptions for credit derivatives and inflation expectations. The fair value of derivatives is presented as the net of assets and liabilities.\n\nIn order to calculate the sensitivity (range) of the fair value of shares and interest-bearing securities, the fair value is increased and decreased within a total range of 2-10 per-",

Transferred assets and obtained collateral\n\n## Transferred assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities\n\nAssets are considered to be transferred from Nordea Bank Abp if Nordea Bank Abp either transfers the contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets or retains that right but has a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more entities.\n\nAll assets transferred continue to be recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea Bank Abp is still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets. This is the case for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and derivative transactions.\n\nRepurchase agreements are a form of collateralised borrowing where Nordea Bank Abp sells securities with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date at a fixed price. The cash received is recognised as a deposit (liability). Securities delivered under repurchase agreements are not derecognised from the balance sheet.\n\nSecurities lending transactions are transactions where Nordea Bank Abp lends securities it holds to a counterparty and receives a fee.\n\nIn derivative transactions Nordea Bank Abp delivers collateral which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. Such transactions are mainly related to collateral delivered under CSA agreements.\n\nAs both repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions result in the securities being returned to Nordea Bank Abp, all risks and rewards associated with the instruments transferred are retained by Nordea Bank Abp although they are not available to Nordea Bank Abp during the period which they are transferred. The counterparties to the transactions hold the securities as collateral but have no recourse to other assets in Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nThe securities are still reported on the balance sheet and the corresponding liabilities are measured at fair value or at amortised cost.\n\nOnly transferred shares and bonds reported on the balance sheet are reported in the table in the following page.",

The transactions are conducted under standard agreements employed by financial market participants. Generally, the agreements require additional collateral to be provided if the value of the securities falls below a predetermined level. Under the standard terms of most repurchase transactions, the recipient of collateral has an unrestricted right to sell or repledge it, subject to returning equivalent securities on settlement of the transactions. The fair value of the securities obtained as collateral under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements is disclosed below.

The Board of Directors proposes that the 24 March 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) authorise it to decide on a dividend payment of a maximum of EUR 2,681,667,380.00* in one or several instalments. The payment would be distributed based on the balance sheet to be adopted for the financial year ended\n\n31 December 2021 and the authorisation would remain in force until the beginning of the next AGM.\n\nThe dividend would be paid from retained earnings. After a maximum dividend payout, EUR 16,195,958,833.72 would be carried forward as distributable retained earnings.\n\nIn the opinion of the Board of Directors, the proposed distribution of earnings does not risk the solvency of Nordea Bank Abp.

        "page_content": "As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the e/ff.ligaect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n| Overall group materiality                        | \u20ac 200 million                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                             | 0.65% of equity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Rationale for the materiality  benchmark applied | We chose equity as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark  against which the capital resources of the bank are most commonly measured  by users and is a generally accepted benchmark. We chose 0,65% which is  within the range of acceptable quantitative materiality thresholds in auditing  standards. |\n\n## How we tailored our group audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the Nordea Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.\n\nWe determined the type of work that needed to be performed at group companies by us, as the group engagement team, or by component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction.  Where the work was performed by component auditors, we issued specific instructions to reporting component auditors which included our risk analysis, materiality and audit approach to centralised systems. Audits were performed in group companies which were considered significant either because of their individual financial significance or due to their specific nature, covering the majority of revenue, assets and liabilities of the Group.\n\nBy performing the procedures above at group companies, combined with additional procedures at the group level, we have obtained su/ffi.ligacient and appropriate evidence regarding the financial information of the Group as a whole to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matter in the audit of the Group\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Impairment of loans to customers\n\nRefer to the Note G1 - Accounting policies (Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty), Note G11 - Net loan losses and Note G14 - Loans and impairment to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nA high level of judgement is involved in determining the appropriate impairment loss to be recognised. For individually assessed loans, judgement is involved in determining whether a loan has a loss event and in assessing the loan loss amount.\n\nExpected credit losses (ECL) are calculated as a function of the probability of default, the exposure at default and the loss given default, as well as the timing of the loss.\n\nNordea categorises loans into three stages depending on the level of credit risk or changes in credit risk for each individual loan. For loans without significant increase in credit risk, stage 1, expected credit losses are calculated for estimated defaults within 12 months. For loans where there is a significant increase in credit risk, stage 2, or loans in default, stage 3, a/uni00A0lifetime of expected losses are calculated.\n\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted management's determination of the ECL. To address the uncertainties inherent in the current and future environment and to reflect all relevant risk factors not captured in the Nordea's modelled results, management developed post-model adjustments. Additionally, Nordea uses adjustments to the model-driven ECL results to address impairment model limitations.\n\nThis is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of financial instruments held at fair value\n\nRefer to the Note G1 - Accounting policies (Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty), Note G19 - Derivatives and hedge accounting, Note G40 - Classification of financial instruments and Note G41 - Assets and liabilities at fair value to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIncreased volatility and widespread macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic continue to be a key theme across most major markets. The challenging valuation environment emphasises the importance of robust valuation and reporting controls and the valuation of financial instruments continues to be an area of inherent risk. The valuation of Level II and III financial instruments utilises observable and unobservable inputs respectively, for recurring fair value measurements. Significant portfolios of financial instruments are valued based on models and certain assumptions that are not observable by third parties.\n\nImportant areas in valuation of financial instruments held at fair value relate to:\n\n- \u00b7 Framework and policies relating to models and valuation;\n- \u00b7 Internal controls relating to fair value adjustments, price testing, fair value hierarchy and model control & governance; and\n- \u00b7 Disclosures of financial instruments.\n\nThis is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nOur audit included a combination of testing of internal controls over financial reporting and substantive testing.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the loan origination process, credit risk management and the impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers.\n\nWe had a special focus on post-model adjustments developed as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the credit risk development for large customers.\n\nBased on risk, we selected individual loans and performed detailed credit file reviews and assessed its credit risk.\n\nFor ECL models, we involved our modelling specialists to assess the methodology, challenge the underlying assumptions and to independently reperform the calculation for a/uni00A0sample of loans.\n\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the assumptions and accuracy of underlying data used to develop post-model adjustments and reviewed that governance procedures have been performed.\n\nWe have also assessed the disclosures related to impairment of loans.\n\nWe assessed and tested the design and operating e/ff.ligaectiveness of the controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 The identification, measurement and oversight of valuation of financial instruments\n- \u00b7 Fair value adjustments, independent price verification and fair value hierarchy\n- \u00b7 Model control and governance.\n\nWe examined the Group's independent price verification processes, model validation and approval processes, controls over data feeds and inputs to valuation and fair value hierarchy and the Group's governance and reporting processes and controls.\n\nFor the valuations dependent on unobservable inputs or which involve a higher degree of judgement, we assessed the assumptions, methodologies and models used by the Group. We performed an independent valuation of a sample of positions.\n\nIn respect of fair value adjustments, specifically Credit, Debt and Funding fair value adjustments (CVA, DVA and FFVA) for derivatives we assessed the methodology applied, underlying models and assumptions made by the Group and compared it with our knowledge of current industry practice. We tested the controls over the data inputs to the underlying models and on a sample basis tested underlying transactions back to supporting evidence.\n\nWe have also assessed the disclosures related to valuation of financial instruments held at fair value.",

The value is based on models where significant judgement is applied in setting economic assumptions, actuarial assumptions as well as customer behaviour. Changes in these assumptions can materially impact the valuation of technical provisions.\n\n## IT systems supporting processes over financial reporting\n\nDue to the significant number of transactions that are processed, the Group's financial reporting is highly dependent on IT systems supporting automated accounting and reconciliation procedures. To ensure complete and accurate financial records it is important that controls over appropriate access rights, program development and changes are designed and operate e/ff.ligaectively.\n\nThis is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nWe assessed the design and tested operating e/ff.ligaectiveness of the controls over the process for calculating provisions within the Life business.\n\nOur audit also included assessments of applied methods, models and assumptions used in calculating the provisions. We have on a sample basis performed recalculations of the provisions. The audit was carried out involving PwC actuaries.\n\nWe have tested the design and operating e/ff.ligaectiveness for controls related to the IT systems relevant for financial reporting. Our assessment included, access to program and data as well as program development and changes.\n\nFor logical access to program and data, audit activities included testing of addition of access rights, removal of access rights and monitoring of appropriateness as well as appropriate segregation of duties. Other areas tested included monitoring of IT systems and controls over changes to IT systems.\n\nThere are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the parent company's or the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

Our Code of Conduct and the principles for financing, investing and advice in our Sustainability Policy govern our operations.\n\n## Strategic management of ESG-related risks\n\nESG-related credit risk is defined in Nordea's risk taxonomy as the risk of credit losses from the current or prospective impacts of ESG factors. Consequently, ESG is integrated into the credit process through the Group credit risk framework.\n\nNordea has redeveloped aspects of the corporate customer ESG assessment to systematically integrate transitional risk considerations into the credit decision process. Our new climate risk assessment tool was developed relying on a set of questions that consider our customer group's greenhouse gas emissions and transition planning robustness as well as the impact on repayment capacity from transition-related changes in policies, market demand, technology improvements, costs and capital expenditures. Identified climate-related risks are integrated into the credit risk assessment and the conclusions are documented in the credit memorandum.\n\nIn the household sector the main ESG-related risks are within mortgage lending, where energy e/ffi.ligaciency and physical hazard risks are our focus areas. We are preparing to embed these risk elements in our mortgage process.\n\nFrom a market risk perspective, ESG principles are being continuously developed and incorporated into the framework for long-term illiquid asset investments. Due to the developing nature of both global challenges and our response, new strategy and governance developments are incorporated as soon as practically possible after they have been developed, to guide the management of current and future impacts of ESG factors as well as to support and promote companies that are seeking to become, or already are, positive-impact contributors. The ESG and impact principles guiding investment decisions include the introduction of concrete ESG criteria, which fund managers seeking to secure investments from\n\nNordea are expected to either satisfy at the outset or strive to satisfy as soon as practically possible. The principles also include the requirement of monitoring the progress of ESG performance within the portfolio, with plans to develop KPIs for stronger tracking and reporting on performance.\n\n## Integrating climate-related risks into investment decisions\n\nFulfilling our mission to deliver returns responsibly requires us to manage the exposure to climate-related risks in our investment portfolios. Since 2020 we have estimated and tracked key climate metrics across a number of possible scenarios for climate change and climate policy outcomes.\n\nInvestment teams in Nordea Asset Management (NAM) have access to a proprietary ESG data platform, allowing them to integrate climate-related analyses into the investment research process. To equip portfolio managers and other investment professionals with an adequate understanding of climate-related risks and their financial implications, an extensive climate risk workshop concept was developed in 2021.\n\nAt Nordea Life & Pension (NLP) we also continued the work to further develop and enhance our capabilities to integrate climate-related risks and opportunities into the investment processes. In 2021 our climate data capabilities, including backward- and forward-looking metrics and scenario analysis, were significantly strengthened.\n\n## Assessing transition and physical risks in investments\n\nIn both NAM and NLP the MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk (Climate VaR) model is used for listed equities and corporate bonds to assess transition risks (policy risk) and physical risks (extreme weather risk) in di/ff.ligaerent climate scenarios. In addition, NLP has continued to use the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor to assess transition risk in the real estate portfolio. For other illiquid asset classes, where retrieving granular reported data is still a challenge, we aim during 2022 to use a simplified approach where proxy data on sector emissions is applied to the portfolio's sector exposure distribution.",

Financial strength, cont.\n\n## Policy risk\n\nFor policy risk, MSCI Climate VaR includes three scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System: 1.5\u00b0C Orderly; 2\u00b0C Disorderly; and 3\u00b0C. The 1.5\u00b0C Orderly scenario assumes that new climate policies are introduced early and gradually become more stringent to limit warming. The 2\u00b0C Disorderly scenario assumes that most new climate policies are delayed until 2030, which means that emissions reductions need to be sharper and more drastic than in the Orderly scenario. The 3\u00b0C scenario mostly represents already announced but not yet implemented climate policy e/ff.ligaorts and hence assumes that some climate policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, but that global e/ff.ligaorts are insufficient to halt significant global warming. In the table below we disclose policy risk according to these three scenarios for listed equities and corporate bonds for both NAM and NLP.\n\nPolicy risk is defined as being zero in a business-as-usual scenario where global warming amounts to 4\u00b0C. In lowertemperature scenarios the policy risk is defined as a di/ff.ligaerential relative to this baseline. It is measured by translating climate-related policy costs into valuation impacts on companies and their publicly tradable securities. Hence, the values in the table below express the aggregated potential impact on market valuations of investment portfolios as a result of the climate policies associated with each scenario.

The MSCI Climate VaR model estimates physical risk in a 4\u00b0C scenario, which represents a continuation of business-as-usual and is modelled using a combination of short-term projections of historical climate data and a high-emissions long-term scenario. In the table below we disclose extreme weather risk in this scenario for listed equities and corporate bonds for both NAM and NLP.\n\nExtreme weather risk is defined as being zero in a scenario where there is no future change in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and in the 4\u00b0C scenario extreme weather risk is defined as a di/ff.ligaerential relative to this baseline. It is measured by translating extreme weather-related damages to physical assets into valuation impacts on companies and their publicly tradable securities. For extreme weather risk, the model uses a stochastic approach to estimating damages, where the 50th percentile represents an 'Average' 4\u00b0C scenario and the 95th percentile represents an 'Aggressive' 4\u00b0C scenario. This means that the 'Aggressive' scenario explores the less likely but more extreme potential damages in a 4\u00b0C global warming scenario. The values in the table below express the aggregated potential impact on market valuations of investment portfolios as a result of the extreme weather damages associated with each scenario.\n\n| Extreme weather risk Climate VaR   as of end 2021   | Average   | Aggressive   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|\n| Nordea Asset Management                             |           |              |\n| Listed equities (%)                                 | -6.33     | -8.03        |\n| Corporate bonds (%)                                 | -0.28     | -0.46        |\n| Nordea Life & Pension                               |           |              |\n| Listed equities (%)                                 | -5.82     | -7.37        |\n| Corporate bonds (%)                                 | -0.43     | -0.71        |",

Climate action, cont.\n\n## Financed emissions\n\nIn accordance with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) we attribute a share of our clients' emissions, for example, corresponding to the value of the business loan or investment provided by us, divided by the corporate customer's value, to our own scope 3 carbon footprint.\n\nIn 2021 we started to estimate our financed emissions for the asset classes: business loans; road motor vehicles loans; mortgages; listed equities; corporate fixed income; and commercial real estate investment. 2021 disclosures are provided for business loans to oil and gas exploration and production; business loans to the shipping sector; and investments in listed equities for Nordea Asset Management (NAM) and Nordea Life & Pension (NLP) as well as directly held real estate for NLP. Business loans are calculated for 2020. Investments in listed equities are calculated for the years 2019 to 2021, and directly held real estate for the years 2019 and 2020.\n\n## Data quality\n\nOur financed emissions are based on data from our clients when available, which is increasingly the case as companies are setting up accounting of scope 1 and 2 emissions. This has helped us in our internal prioritisation of sectors and regions selected for targeted emissions reductions and risk management. For lending customers who have yet to calculate their emissions, we estimate the financed emissions by applying general emission factors at sector level from the PCAF database while controlling for sector proxy data quality.\n\nTo calculate financed emissions we are reliant on available greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from our clients. This is not available at end of year like the financial data is. Therefore we must handle a data access delay. For our lending portfolio where financed emissions is a target metric we await reported data from clients and therefore disclose 2020 financed emissions data based on clients' GHG emissions and financial data for the same year with one year delay. For 2021 reporting of financed emissions on investments we use 2021 financial data, but the GHG emissions data from clients is mainly GHG emissions data from year 2020.\n\nThe data quality varies between asset classes and is generally better for larger assets like listed equities and corporate\n\n## Data quality hierarchy according to PCAF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbonds than for business loans to smaller customers, which constitute the majority of our corporate lending portfolio. Over the year we collected GHG emissions data on approximately half of the large corporate exposures (PCAF score 1 or 2 depending on whether they are verified or not) and we retrieved the publicly available energy performance certificates (PCAF score 3) for residential real estate covering close to one-third of our total mortgage portfolio.\n\nAs we are continuously improving the basis of our financed emissions through higher quality data, we believe it will become more meaningful to disclose the absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions for our full lending portfolio across the target scope of business loans, road motor vehicles, mortgages and commercial real estate once a significant share of customer level information has been incorporated. We will also expand the scope to include emissions from our portfolio of leased road motor vehicles.\n\nTo improve the quality of our lending portfolio data we have developed a plan stretching from 2021 to 2023 in order to move from estimates at score 5 of the PCAF data quality hierarchy (see the figure below) towards scores 1, 2 and 3. In this first year of financed emissions disclosure of the lending portfolio we focused on oil and gas exploration and production as well as shipping, which are sectors where we have customer level data and financed emission asset class models through PCAF and Finance Denmark's CO2 Model.\n\nFor our investment portfolios we primarily collect information on investee companies via data providers. For companies in our investment portfolios that do not publicly report their scope 1 and 2 emissions and therefore obtain PCAF scores 1 or 2, we use MSCI estimation models. The MSCI's production model (E.PROD) is used for electric utilities where the type of fuel is known as equivalent to PCAF score 2. The MSCI company-specific intensity model (E.CSI) is used for companies where we have historical but not current emissions data as equivalent to PCAF score 3. The MSCI industry segment-specific intensity model (E.Segmt) is based on sector averages for companies that have not made any disclosures and equivalent to PCAF score 4.\n\nFor NLP's directly held real estate portfolio we use supplier-specific reported data corresponding to score 1 in PCAF's data quality hierarchy for commercial real estate.\n\nAudited GHG emissions data or actual primary energy data\n\nNon-audited GHG emissions data or other primary data\n\nAveraged data that is peer/(sub)-sector specific\n\nProxy data on the basis of region or country\n\nEstimated data with very limited support",

The deep dives involved quantifying financed emissions and assessing customers' alignment to the anticipated GHG emissions reduction pathway required to fulfil our sustainability targets and objectives. The aim of the deep dives was to identify climate-related transition risks and opportunities in these industries in preparation for setting our industry targets from 2022. Deep dives into exposures to the remaining transition-vulnerable industries will continue from 2022 onwards.\n\n## Oil and gas\n\nIn September 2021 we updated our Sector Guideline for the Fossil Fuel-based Industries to phase out unconventional oil and gas as well as drilling in sensitive areas of the Arctic region. During the year we analysed the oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore sector. We improved the emissions data quality and now have customer-level data covering more than 80% of our exposure. We expect the financed emissions in our carefully selected oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore portfolio to decline to support our 2030 emissions reduction target.\n\nWe are committed to contributing to the global net-zero emissions goal. To that end we will continue to engage directly with clients to encourage them to have credible Parisaligned transition plans. This year is the first time we disclose the scope 1 and scope 2 financed emissions of the exploration and production segment of our oil and gas portfolio as well as scope 3 following the PCAF Global Standard for financed emissions accounting recommendations.\n\n| Oil and gas exploration and production (2020)   | Financed   emissions   (tCO /two.dnom e)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Scope 1 and 2 1                                 | 427,542                                    |\n| Scope 3 2                                       | 3,592,726                                  |\n\n## Shipping\n\nIn addition to the work ongoing within the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, we are working to promote a cleaner and more responsible shipping industry through other partnerships. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is targeting a 50% reduction in global carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050, relative to 2008 levels. The results of our second year as a signatory to the Poseidon Principles, i.e. 2020, show that our shipping portfolio was 1.1% lower than the global target trajectory. At year-end 2019 it was 6.7% higher than the trajectory. We calculated our alignment using high-quality data, as the climate data reporting rate for our shipping customers is close to 100%. This year, we disclose the financed emissions of our shipping portfolio for the first time.\n\n| Shipping (2020)   | Financed   emissions  (tCO /two.dnom e)   |   Portfolio alignment  with IMO global   target trajectory   (% below or above  trajectory) |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope 1 1         | 4,922,390                                 |                                                                                        -1.1 |\n\nWe are also committed to the Responsible Ship Recycling Standards (RSRS) for banks. The RSRS is aimed at promoting responsible ship recycling and minimising the dangers associated with hazardous materials onboard. In 2021 100% (97%) of new loan agreements for Nordea-financed vessels included a clause relating to responsible recycling. Over time, we aim to continue including a responsible recycling clause in all new loan agreements for Nordea-financed vessels in the shipping sector. For our complete reporting according to the RSRS requirements, see nordea.com/sustainability.\n\n## Mining and supporting activities\n\nDuring 2021 we analysed the mining and supporting activities sector. In our view, the metallic minerals, non-metallic minerals and energy minerals segments have very di/ff.ligaerent transition risk and opportunity profiles in terms of enabling the global and EU roadmap towards a net-zero emissions economy. To reduce emissions su/ffi.ligaciently the transition requires a large increase in the supply of metallic minerals such as nickel, copper and lithium, which are used in renewable energy technologies and electric vehicle batteries. Non-metallic minerals such as sand, gravel and limestone are central to enabling infrastructure and the construction of buildings, roads and bridges, while energy minerals such as thermal coal and thermal peat must be phased out. We no longer have any lending exposure towards thermal coal mining. We will continue to support metallic and non-metallic clients that have credible Paris-aligned transition plans. Our analysis also improved our financed emissions data quality for mining. We will continue to gather more and better customer level emissions data prior to disclosing sector financed emissions of sufficiently good quality.\n\n## Investment portfolio\n\nWhile NAM's financed emissions for equity have increased from 2019 to 2021, our carbon footprint has seen an overall decrease. NLP's financed emissions, adjusted for the increase in data coverage, increased by 8% between 2019 and 2021, driven by portfolio growth. In the table below, the figures are coverage-adjusted. Securities for which no data is available are assumed to be at the average of the sector. This is done to avoid excluding those securities and thereby undercounting financed emissions.",

The increase in WACI for corporate bonds in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven in part by an increased exposure to utilities with higher intensity.\n\n| Weighted average carbon intensity (tCO /two.dnom e/USDm  in revenue)   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Nordea Asset Management                                                |        |        |        |\n| Listed equities 1                                                      | 114.8  | 103.0  | 132.4  |\n| Corporate bonds 2                                                      | 119.0  | 120.4  | 144.9  |\n| Nordea Life & Pension                                                  |        |        |        |\n| Listed equities 3                                                      | 87.4   | 94.4   | 120.0  |\n| Corporate bonds 4                                                      | 109.9  | 73.6   | 93.9   |\n\n## Carbon footprint\n\nIn 2021 NAM developed fund-specific carbon footprint targets in accordance with the Net Zero Investment Framework. NAM's equity carbon footprint saw a significant decrease from 2019 to 2020, driven in part by a reduction in exposure to the energy and utility sectors and a switch to less carbon-intensive companies within these sectors. The slight increase in carbon footprint from 2020 to 2021 follows a relative increase in exposure to basic materials, industrials and utilities.\n\nIn May 2021 we communicated NLP's 2025 targets, which were developed in accordance with the principles of the NetZero Asset Owner Alliance's Inaugural Target Setting Protocol. The targets include a reduction of at least 25% in the carbon footprint for listed equities, corporate bonds and directly held real estate. Indicative figures for 2021 show that NLP's carbon footprint for listed equities, corporate bonds and real estate decreased by 25.9% between 2019 and 2021. The decrease was driven in part by the introduction of NLP's new Climate Policy with stricter criteria for fossil fuels, which resulted in lower exposure to primarily the energy and utility sectors.\n\n| Carbon footprint (tCO /two.dnom e/USDm invested)     | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Nordea Asset Management                              |        |        |        |\n| Listed equities 1                                    | 41.0   | 37.2   | 49.8   |\n| Nordea Life & Pension                                |        |        |        |\n| Listed equities, corporate bonds and   real estate 2 | 34.9   | 41.2   | 47.1   |\n\n## Climate action at Nordea\n\nAlthough our greatest impact on the climate is through financing and investments, we also work to reduce the climate impact from our internal operations.\n\n## New ways of working\n\nThe travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in travelling - 92% for air travel -  in 2021 compared with 2019. Being unable to travel has resulted in new ways of working together and in natural adjustments to our travel guidelines. We can now rely much more on digital meetings, which means that we will not return to pre-pandemic travel levels. In addition to reducing travel overall, the updated travel guidelines also require us to travel more by train to further reduce our carbon footprint. In 2020 we introduced a new company car policy and from 2021 we have only allowed electric and plug-in hybrid company cars. This has been well received by our employees, with plug-in hybrids accounting for 61% of all new company cars. The trend towards low-emission mobility was strongest in Finland, where 48% of all new registrations were fully electric company cars.\n\nWe are also working towards making our workplace more sustainable. For example by o/ff.ligaering more vegetarian options and serving local and seasonal produce as much as possible. In 2021 we introduced beehives and urban gardens on the rooftops of several Nordea headquarters (HQ). We aim to inspire our employees to reduce their own carbon footprint. To this end, we hosted sustainability events for employees and facilitated discussions in branches and HQ. As well as being a way to share ongoing initiatives, these events were also forums for discussing and developing new ideas to create positive change.",

Climate action, cont.\n\n## Resource e/ffi.ligaciency\n\nUsing resources e/ffi.ligaciently is not only a matter of cost but is also key to reducing our environmental impact. In 2021 we decreased our energy consumption by 7% compared with 2020. While the reduction was primarily driven by employees working remotely, it was also a result of ongoing system improvements, such as the redesign of the ventilation system at our Finnish HQ and a general move towards LED lights and motion-activated lighting. The majority of our large HQ o/ffi.ligaces are LEED- or BREEAM-certified to ensure energy e/ffi.ligaciency. To reduce our carbon footprint associated with energy consumption, we purchase 100% renewable electricity through Guarantees of Origin equal to our electricity consumption in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Poland and Luxembourg.\n\nOne of the main drivers of our energy consumption is the data centres which make our digital services possible. To minimise energy consumption, we work to keep our servers up to date and running as e/ffi.ligaciently as possible. A side e/ff.ligaect of the high activity level in the data centres is the generation of excess heat. Since 2020 we have had a large heat pump installed. This distributes excess heat to private households in the community, limiting the need for additional cooling of the\n\nservers and helping us to significantly reduce our electricity consumption.\n\nWe have taken a structured approach, replacing physical letters with customer-friendly digital solutions through our Paperless Banking Programme. Since 2017 the programme has digitalised approximately 50% of all customer letters, enabling a reduction in carbon emissions associated with distribution.\n\nOptimising water and waste management is also important for ensuring resource e/ffi.ligaciency. In 2021 our total water consumption was down on the 2020 level at 74,353 (110,369) cubic metres, most likely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. We continuously strive to reduce the amount of waste we generate in our operations.\n\n## Internal carbon footprint\n\nEach year, we strive to make our carbon reporting more complete. In 2019 we added postal services, paper and water to our internal carbon footprint. In 2020 we included emissions from waste for the first time. Despite the wider scope of our carbon footprint, we have managed to reduce the emissions from our internal operations for two years running. Our total emissions of 11,327 (15,898) tonnes of CO2e in 2021 marked a\n\n| Internal carbon footprint                                                            | 2021      | 2020      | 2019    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Fuel and energy consumption                                                          |           |           |         |\n| - fuel consumption for diesel generators (litres) 1                                  | 25,643    | 27,480    | 25,855  |\n| - fuel consumption for leased cars (litres) 2                                        | 656,836 3 | 674,547 3 | 653,103 |\n| - electricity (MWh) 4                                                                | 57,783    | 62,356    | 67,431  |\n| - district heating (MWh)                                                             | 29,933    | 29,128    | 32,362  |\n| - district cooling (MWh)                                                             | 4,943     | 5,893     | 6,269   |\n| Energy intensity (MWh/EURm of total operating income) 5                              | 9.63      | 11.50     | 12.28   |\n| CO/two.dnome emissions from fuel and energy consumption (tonnes)                     |           |           |         |\n| - diesel generators (scope 1)                                                        | 68        | 73        | 66      |\n| - leased cars (scope 1) 2, 6                                                         | 1,378 7   | 1,382     | 1,572   |\n| - electricity (scope 1 and 2)                                                        | 0 8       | 0         | 0       |\n| - district heating (scope /two.tf)                                                   | 3,112     | 3,904     | 4,512   |\n| - district cooling (scope /two.tf)                                                   | 199       | 889       | 882     |\n| - fuel- and energy-related activities not included in scope 1 and 2 (scope 3)        | 2,060     | 3,336     | 3,872   |\n| CO/two.dnome emissions from business travel (tonnes)                                 |           |           |         |\n| - air travel (scope 3)                                                               | 1,123     | 2,553     | 20,864  |\n| - own car (scope 3)                                                                  | 646       | 909       | 2,047   |\n| - taxi (scope 3)                                                                     | 77        | 73        | 485     |\n| - hotels (scope 3)                                                                   | 179       | 357       | 1,618   |\n| Other CO/two.dnome emissions (tonnes)                                                |           |           |         |\n| - postal services (scope 3)/nine.numr                                                | 2,189     | 1,892     | 4,994   |\n| - paper (scope 3)                                                                    | 239       | 377       | 668     |\n| - water (scope 3)                                                                    | 32        | 116       | 163     |\n| - waste (scope 3) 9                                                                  | 25        | 37        | 42      |\n| Total CO 2 e emissions (tonnes)                                                      | 11,327    | 15,898    | 41,785  |\n| CO2e emission intensity (total tonnes CO2e emissions/EURm of total operating income) | 1.18      | 1.88      | 4.84    |",

We buy o/ff.ligasets corresponding to our total emissions.\n\nOur internal carbon footprint includes carbon emissions from our operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Estonia and Luxembourg because this is where we have our main operations and where we have operational control. This covers 99% of our employees.\n\nGHG accounting is performed according to the GHG Protocol, including scope 1-3 and the following sources: mobile combustion of leased cars and stationary combustion from diesel generators (scope 1); purchased electricity, heating and cooling (scope 2); and emissions from production of energy carriers, business travel, postal services, paper and water consumption (scope 3). In 2020 we added waste as well as energy use and business travel for our Luxembourg operations. Still excluded from the scope are train and ferry travel and rental cars as well as purchased goods and services, IT equipment, etc.\n\nCarbon emissions from electricity in the table on the previous page are disclosed as market-based, i.e. after buying 100% renewable electricity through Guarantees of Origin. Renewable energy equals our electricity consumption of 57,783 MWh and 1,800 litres of EcoPar of our fuel consumption. All emissions are stated in tonnes of CO2-equivalent (CO2e). The calculations cover the relevant GHGs, namely CO2, CH4 and N2O. We disclose the emissions factors that we have used as a basis for our calculations in relation to each source of emission in a separate table below. Applied Global Warming Potentials (GWP) based on IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (2007) are: CO2 - 1, CH4 - 25 and N2O - 298.\n\nThe base year for our carbon footprint is 2019 as the scope of our GHG accounting by then also included the additional sources we could retrieve data for and was as such complete. Furthermore, in 2019 we had fairly normal temperatures in the Nordics, making that year suited to serve as our base year to track progress.\n\n| Source of emission   | Emission factor used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Diesel generators    | 2021/colon.ss02 Swedish EPA, 2021. 2020/colon.ss02 Swedish EPA, 2019.  2019/colon.ss02 Swedish EPA, 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Leased cars          | 2021/colon.ss02 Swedish EPA, 2021;

Furthermore, we address human rights as a sustainability issue in all parts of our organisation and in our due diligence processes. We have identified our most critical human rights areas as being within financing, investments, transactions and sourcing. A couple of years ago we conducted an independent human rights assessment and identified a need to continue working on embedding human rights in our processes in these areas. In 2021 we initiated the work to develop a position statement on human rights in order to further embed them in our internal operations, governance, financing and investments and supply chain management.\n\n## Integrating human rights in investments and financing\n\nIn line with our 2023 target that all investee companies in funds managed by Nordea Asset Management (NAM) are assessed against the minimum safeguards in the area of human rights (in line with the EU taxonomy), NAM further strengthened the investment assessment process regarding human rights in 2021. The process of assessing investee companies against the minimum safeguards in the area of human rights through norm-based screening continued and the monitoring of principal adverse impact indicators was introduced. Based on this, NAM engaged with companies on their human rights performance and disclosures where relevant.\n\nAlso from a financing perspective, we started to investigate how we could apply minimum social safeguards, including human rights, in our environmental, social and governance analysis of credit customers, in line with the EU taxonomy.\n\n## Monitoring customer transactions for human rights breaches\n\nIndividual transaction behaviour captured through our monitoring scenarios, such as transactions involving certain highrisk jurisdictions or indications of funnel account behaviour, can be linked to many types of financial and predicate crime, including modern slavery and human tra/ffi.ligacking.\n\nHuman tra/ffi.ligacking causes tremendous harm and, as such, we treat human tra/ffi.ligacking risk as a priority in our crime detection and prevention e/ff.ligaorts. The Nordic region is primarily a destination for victims tra/ffi.ligacked from other countries. However, the recruitment, transportation and exploitation of people can also happen within the Nordic countries. Financial products and services can be abused by organised crime networks and individual perpetrators to finance crime, receive revenue from criminal activities or launder criminal proceeds.\n\nIn 2020 we undertook an extensive intelligence gathering exercise regarding human tra/ffi.ligacking typologies in the Nordics. In 2021 we conducted a pilot exercise which applied the knowledge and investigative experience gained to our data analytics capabilities. The pilot succeeded in helping us to proactively identify potential human tra/ffi.ligacking activity, which we reported to the relevant authorities. We are continuing our e/ff.ligaorts to further develop this initiative.\n\n## Suppliers screened for human rights risks\n\nWe integrate human rights risks into our supplier screening and monitoring processes. We aim to achieve an even more in-depth understanding of the human rights risks in our supply chain when we by 2023 have a human rights impact assessment of our supply chain in place.",

Social responsibility, cont.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nOur community engagement strategy is about creating positive change through our employees with focus on building financial skills and fostering entrepreneurship.\n\n## Financial skills\n\nOur long-standing partnership with Me & My City - a learning environment for sixth- and ninth-grade students in Finland o/ff.ligaering insights into society, working life and entrepreneurship - was run as a hybrid model this year, combining classroom-based and online events. In Sweden and Norway we continued to run our own financial skills training programme, Ekonomipejl and \u00d8konomipeil. In Denmark we developed a new financial skills programme '\u00d8konomiundervisning til skoleelever'. These programmes target upper-secondary and high school students and are o/ff.ligaered as both classroom-based and online sessions throughout each country. In Poland we continued to participate in the programme 'Internet does not forget', where our employees train children in banking-related cyber security.\n\nTo further foster the financial inclusion of immigrants and other marginalised groups we also support and mentor young people through several di/ff.ligaerent partnerships, including Plan International, Startup Refugees and Vamos in Finland and Integrationspakten in Sweden.\n\nIn 2021 our training of senior citizens in digital banking was somewhat limited due to the challenges of o/ff.ligaering training through digital channels to people who have yet to become digital. Nevertheless, we did run online workshops on digital safety for seniors in Finland.\n\n## Entrepreneurship\n\nWe have several partnerships across the Nordics with an entrepreneurship focus, such as with Fonden for Entrepren\u00f8rskab in Denmark, Kasvu Open and 4H in Finland, Ungt Entrepren\u00f8rskap in Norway and Norrsken Foundation and Antler in Sweden.\n\nAt Nordic level we are also a main partner of Slush, one of the biggest startup events globally. The theme for Slush 2021 was 'Entrepreneurship redefined' through diversity and inclusion, purpose-driven change and revolutionary innovation.\n\nOur own matchmaking programme, Investor Speed Dating, generated a total of 784 curated meetings for local and global investors and Nordic founders. In 2021 our campaign centred around investor speed dating and mentoring - We Grow Startups - was elected sustainability campaign of the year by the Finnish sponsorship and event marketing association, SPOT. During the year more than 400 startup founders had matchmaking meetings with our vast network of investors.\n\n## Our people\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nIn 2021 the response rate to our employee engagement survey, the People Pulse, increased to 83% from 81% in 2020. We continued to see good results in relation to both overall engagement and communication and information. The latter has been instrumental in helping us to manage the organisation during the pandemic and the reopening of our o/ffi.ligaces.\n\nAccording to the People Pulse, our people generally experienced clear and truthful leadership communication from the senior management of the respective business area or Group function (index 77). Moreover, feeling valued as an employee was overall stable in 2021 (index 76) and the likelihood of employees recommending Nordea as a workplace was high, with an employee net promoter score of 30.\n\n## Equal opportunities\n\nOur work to counter unconscious bias is ongoing and we have further strengthened our training and tools to enhance the inclusiveness of our workplaces, leadership and recruitment processes. All employees are subject to fair and unbiased remuneration decisions. We analyse potential equal pay gaps annually and, through communication and training, continue to support people leaders in mitigating the risk of discrimination regarding remuneration and other employment terms. In 2021 we implemented new guidelines o/ff.ligaering rainbow parents equal opportunities for parental leave, including in locations where legislation does not yet cover this option.\n\n## We encourage our people to speak up\n\nIn 2021 1.2% (1.3%) of People Pulse respondents stated that they had been subjected to some form of harassment or other mistreatment. 27 (10) harassment cases were reported through various channels, including our whistleblowing function and Raise Your Concern where our people are encouraged to report any suspected illegal or unethical actions.\n\nThe increase in cases compared with 2020 was expected as we continued to strengthen diversity and inclusion within Nordea, indicating that our people feel confident about reporting cases. We take mistreatment of any kind very seriously and continue our ongoing work, proactively implementing measures to ensure safe and inclusive workplaces for all employees.\n\n## Sick leave\n\nAt 3.11% (3.02%), our sick leave rate showed a slight increase but remains on an acceptable level. Our people said they felt good about the workload in their job, returning an average index score of 73. As societies reopened, influenza and other seasonal epidemics expectedly had a greater impact on the sick leave rate in 2021 than in 2020.",

Social responsibility, cont.\n\n## Learning and development\n\nOpportunities for learning and personal growth are a leading source of motivation for our employees not only to join Nordea but also to remain with us. We aspire to be an employer of choice and thus o/ff.ligaer equal opportunities for our people to learn and grow. Performance development and talent management are fundamental in this respect.\n\nOur learning framework is based on a 70-20-10 framework: 70% learning by doing; 20% learning from others; and 10% formal learning. The average number of formal learning hours in 2021 (9.4 hours) increased relative to 2020 (8.9 hours). In addition, our people spent on average 2.1 hours on other virtual training through our learning marketplace.\n\nTo prevent time-consuming remuneration processes for both employees and people leaders, we are working on simplifying reward structures and processes. Going forward, we will apply greater focus to supporting performance, development and engagement through meaningful goal setting, continuous feedback and holistic performance evaluation within our Performance and Learning Dialogues (PLDs). In 2021 91% (90%) of our people had a PLD.\n\nTalent management continues to be a focus area. The postpandemic job market is heated, and we have seen an increase in our employee turnover rate (8.8% in 2021, compared with 6.7% in 2020). Our internal job market and development opportunities are key to retaining our people and developing our workforce.\n\nThrough a systemised and digital approach we can now reach most of the organisation to identify talent and areas for development. Succession management also remains a key focus area.\n\n## Changes in the workforce\n\nAs communicated in 2020, digitalisation and automation continue to drive a need for adjustments and changes to the way we work and how we are organised. In cases where this could lead to certain jobs changing, we will play a key role in securing the right strategic approach for engaging our people, while respecting labour market conditions.

The BOSC is updated on a quarterly basis on the integration of sustainability into our business strategy. With the integration of the Sustainability Report into the Annual Report, the Board Audit Committee (BAC) now reviews and monitors our sustainability reporting as part of our annual reporting.\n\nThe Board is also assisted by the Board Risk Committee in the fulfilment of its oversight responsibilities concerning the management of risks, related frameworks, controls and processes including environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as drivers of existing risk. To ensure a high level of awareness with respect to sustainability and ESG matters, in 2021 the entire Board received training on the key sustainability factors in our business environment that impact our business model, and the BOSC and the BAC were also trained in the EU taxonomy.\n\nIn 2021 we appointed a Group Accountable Executive for ESG risks. We established a new executive-level Group-wide committee - the Sustainability and Ethics Committee (SEC) - as a sub-committee of the CEO's Group Leadership Team (GLT). The SEC consists of representatives from the business areas and Group functions, including Group Risk, Group Credit Management and Group Finance, and supports the Group CEO, the GLT, the BOSC and the Group Board in their oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability. Compared with its predecessor committee, the Business Ethics and Values Committee, the new committee has a stronger mandate to facilitate the integration of sustainability into our business strategy and support the integration of ESG factors into our risk management. It is tasked with recommending to the Group CEO a long-term plan for fully integrating sustainability into our business strategy and ensuring appropriate implementation to achieve Group-level targets. It is also responsible for influencing and following the Group's status and progress regarding ethics and culture, in line with our purpose and values. This involves advising the Group CEO to participate in or withdraw from voluntary commitments related to sustainability and providing guidance to the business areas regarding ethical business dilemmas.\n\nThe executive-level Group Risk Committee (RC) promotes interaction and coordination within the Group on risk matters. With respect to sustainability, the RC is responsible for overseeing the implementation of ESG factors as embedded drivers of existing risks and approving sector guidelines and position statements. In addition to the RC, the SEC also monitors and, when relevant, supports the business areas and Group functions in risk management activities related to the longterm plan for fully integrating sustainability into our business strategy and the associated targets.\n\nTo ensure that sustainability is integrated into all business areas and Group functions, we have established a Groupwide implementation programme with dedicated work streams and an Operational Steering Committee. The programme's progress is monitored by the SEC on a quarterly basis. Starting in 2022, we will integrate sustainability targets into our remuneration programmes to support the integration of sustainability into all internal processes.\n\n## Responsible taxpayer\n\nOur tax policy is constituted by the Group CEO Instructions on Tax, which are aimed at ensuring that we manage tax in an e/ffi.ligacient and compliant way. The CEO Instructions on Tax defines our overall tax governance, including roles and responsibilities in connection with tax charges and related reporting to the tax authorities. The Tax Policy on Customer Advice states that we do not accept being used as a platform for tax evasion or facilitate aggressive tax planning. It also states that we comply with international standards such as the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), the OECD Common Reporting Standard and the EU DAC6 Directive as implemented in national laws, as well as national requirements for customer tax reporting.\n\nWe are a substantial corporate income taxpayer in our main countries of operation - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden - and pay corporate income tax, social security contributions and bank levies, i.e. contributions to deposit guarantee schemes and resolution funds, in all our countries of operation as required by law. Statutory tax rates, contributions and levies vary in our countries of operation, as does the size of our business operations. In any given year the total amount of tax paid in each country is determined by a combination of these variables. We are also a net payer of valueadded tax (VAT), since VAT is generally not recoverable for banks.",

In addition, we also report tax on a country-by-country basis in an appendix, which is available at nordea.com.\n\n## Data privacy\n\nKeeping our personal data safe is part of our commitment to being a safe and trusted bank. Data privacy is therefore an integral part of our business and operations and an important element of our digital strategy. In 2021 we continued to enhance our ability to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws in the jurisdictions where we operate. We streamlined relevant process elements, improved the governance structure and assigned more employees to data privacy operations. Our privacy units continued their important work on topics related to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This included providing training, advice and support and carrying out assurance activities on privacy-related issues. All employees are obliged to complete training courses on the GDPR. During the year we updated these courses to incorporate the latest developments in the area of data privacy.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nIntroducing new technologies, exploring new ways of doing business and connecting with customers widen banks' attack surface. At the same time, entities that pose cyber threats are becoming more organised, resourceful and experienced. Banks must also deal with the asymmetry of having to protect all assets, while entities engaged in cyber threats merely need to find one weak spot. Combined, these factors pose an unprecedented risk to the banking industry.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we focus not only on maintaining e/ff.ligaective basic information security controls but also on enhancing our cyber defence with new tools and functions for security, detection and response. We develop innovative security practices to meet new business demands, such as robust mobile banking applications and proactive customer support for fraud detection and prevention. We develop our information security practice based on recognised industry best practices such as the ISO 27000 series standards and the frameworks provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US. Furthermore, Nordea needs to comply with financial industry legislation, for example European Banking Authority guidelines and other European legislation introducing specific information security requirements.\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic many employees worked remotely from their homes. We addressed the potentially increased cyber risk resulting from this situation with mitigating measures at technical and organisational levels. We did not see an unusually high impact on Nordea from cyber events in this period. Going forward, we expect that part of our business will continue to be carried out remotely, even when COVID-19-related restrictions are completely lifted. Drawing on what we have learnt during the pandemic, we will continue to enhance our cyber capabilities to address the 'new normal'.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nIn 2021 we fully integrated sustainability screenings and engagements into the daily practices of our sourcing managers, and all suppliers (old and new) in our central database with whom we have an active agreement are now subject to screening and continuous monitoring. Any alerts regarding social issues, such as human rights or labour rights, environmental issues or anti-corruption issues, result in a more indepth due diligence process before initiating engagement.\n\nDuring the year we further enhanced our ongoing monitoring process for existing suppliers and have anchored the continuous oversight of suppliers with our contract management team. If risks are identified, we will continue to engage in dialogues with the suppliers in question in order to determine the appropriate course of action. We believe that engaging in a partner-to-partner spirit will lead to the best outcome and consider terminating agreements only as a last resort.\n\nIn 2021 we continued to build on the supplier reviews conducted in 2020. The revision of our marketing guideline in 2020 has led to 70% of gifts and giveaways now fulfilling a set of predefined sustainability criteria regarding certifications and circularity. This means that we are well on course to reach our 2022 target for 100% of these products to meet the criteria.\n\nOur follow-up dialogues on previously conducted reviews show that suppliers are progressing satisfactorily with the implementation of recommended actions. This includes setting specific sustainability targets and publicly disclosing progress towards these, developing and implementing an anti-corruption policy and aligning product o/ff.ligaerings with agreed sustainability principles.\n\nIn 2021 we reviewed one supplier of IT consultants, one IT hardware supplier and one supplier of financial services. While no severe findings were identified in connection with the individual companies, the reviews identified country- and sector-specific structural issues on working hours, a low maturity of integrating human rights due diligence into the business and an absence of sustainability processes and policies based on internationally recognised standards.\n\nIT continues to be our biggest spend area, representing 27% (31%) of the total spend. We have therefore maintained our seat on the Atea Sustainability Focus (ASF) Advisory Board, through which we cooperate with other large IT buyers to steer the IT sector in a more sustainable direction. Each year the ASF Advisory Board provides several concrete recommendations made by Nordic IT buyers directly to the management of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). With 140 members, six million employees and thousands of subsuppliers, the RBA is the world's leading coalition for sustainability in the IT industry.",

Materiality and impact analysis\n\nAs a member of the core group of founding banks and a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), we are committed to the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. In 2020 we ramped up our e/ff.ligaorts and conducted a combined materiality and impact analysis of our activities, fulfilling the requirements set out in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and in the PRB. The purpose of the analysis was to identify our most significant sustainability impacts to use as input for our long-term plan for how to integrate sustainability into our business strategy that was adopted in 2021. The combined analysis was undertaken at two levels in parallel:\n\n- \u00b7 A strategic level looking at the SDGs, the Paris Agreement as well as international, regional and national regulations and frameworks to identify material sustainability topics.\n- \u00b7 An impact level using the UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks to identify specific targets to drive alignment with and contribution to the sustainability areas identified as significant at the strategic level.\n\nThe materiality and impact analysis was revisited in 2021 and deemed still to be valid without any adjustments and work with our areas of most impact continued, for example through deep dives in a couple of our most climate-vulnerable sectors: oil, gas and o/ff.ligashore; shipping; mining and supporting activities. See Note S2 'Climate action' for details about the deep dives.\n\nBelow is a detailed description of the steps in the materiality and impact analysis conducted in 2020.\n\n## Materiality analysis at a strategic level\n\nAt the strategic level, we used the SDGs as a basis for identifying potentially relevant material sustainability topics since the Paris Agreement and most of the other relevant regulations and frameworks relate to topics that are accommodated in the SDGs.\n\nThe whole of Nordea was considered in the analysis, which means all business areas, all products and services as well as internal operations. In order to identify the SDGs most material to us, we assessed which topics could have an impact on us as well as the topics that we can impact. This resulted in the identification of topics relating to eight SDGs that are of significance to us from either a direct or an indirect impact perspective: quality education; gender equality; a/ff.ligaordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; responsible consumption and production; and climate action.\n\n## Impact analysis\n\nThe impact analysis conducted in parallel with the strategic analysis focused on lending and our balance sheet and took specific country needs and scale of exposure into consideration. It covered three of our four business areas: Personal Banking, Business Banking and Large Corporates & Institutions. Our fourth business area, Asset & Wealth Management, was excluded from the analysis in 2020 as the impact analysis methodology did not then cover investments/asset management. A tool covering investments - the Investment Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool - was launched in 2021, and we have consequently initiated work to conduct an impact analysis of our investments that we expect to finalise in 2022.\n\nSince we are a Nordic bank with most of our lending in four of the Nordic countries, the impact analysis covered Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We populated the UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool with exposure at default (EAD) in the second quarter of 2020. For consumer banking\n\n(Personal Banking) the data covered mortgages. For corporate banking (Large Corporates & Institutions) and business banking (Business Banking) the data covered our top ten sectors (according to the tool guidance).\n\nAt an overall level, in 2020 we had our largest lending to households (55%) followed by corporates (43%) and the public sector (2%). Within corporate lending, our largest exposure was to Real estate (34%), Industrials (25%) and Financial institutions (12%). In addition, we had some country-specific lending to Agriculture in Denmark (16%), to Utilities and public service in Finland (10%), to Maritime in Norway (15%) and to Consumer discretionary and services in Sweden (7%). The figures are more or less the same for 2021. For a full list of the exact exposure per sector and country for 2021, see Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nWhen populating the impact tool with our data, we could conclude that the same SDGs we had identified at a strategic level were also relevant from a portfolio perspective. In addition, the tool helped us determine that our financing also has an impact on biodiversity and resource e/ffi.ligaciency. As a result, we identified two more SDGs of significance to us - life below water and life on land.\n\n## Feeding analysis results into the strategy\n\nAll in all, the combined materiality and impact analysis identified ten SDGs that are of significance to Nordea from an impact perspective - either negative or positive. The ten SDGs were grouped into three strategic pillars: financial strength, climate action and social responsibility. We also work with upholding peace, justice and strong institutions as part of a strong foundation and we work in partnerships to achieve the goals. These make up our fourth strategic pillar: governance and culture. In the table on the next page we describe the rationale and impact of each significant SDG and map them towards a strategic pillar.\n\nAll four pillars are connected to medium-term targets some, such as for shipping, are sector specific as a result of the materiality and impact analysis among other things - and climate action also to long-term objectives as presented in the relevant sections of the report: in the Sustainable banking chapter on pages 28-40 and on pages 315-328 in Note S1 \"Financial strength\", Note S2 \"Climate action\", Note S3 \"Social responsibility\" and Note S4 \"Governance and culture\".\n\n## Stakeholder interaction\n\nWhen conducting the materiality and impact analysis in 2020, we worked closely with internal stakeholders from all levels and parts of the organisation and we also had a dedicated group of Board members as an advisory board who were consulted on several occasions. In addition, we sought input from external stakeholders such as academia, NGOs, investors and customers. The purpose was to obtain their input and to put our suggested strategy into a holistic context to challenge it and put us to the test, ensuring that we had taken all relevant impacts into consideration.\n\n## UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks in brief\n\nThe impact analysis was performed using the UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks which covers the four requirements for undertaking impact analysis: scope, scale of exposure, context and relevance and scale and intensity/ salience. They are described in the PRB Reporting and SelfAssessment Template included in a separate indices document available at nordea.com/sustainability.",

About the sustainability disclosures\n\nNordea has reported on environmental and sustainability performance on an annual basis since 2002. In 2021, for the first time, the sustainability reporting was integrated into Nordea's Annual Report and therefore a separate Sustainability Report is no longer being published. Nordea's sustainability reporting for 2021 constitutes sustainability disclosures found (i) throughout the front section, but mainly in the Sustainable banking chapter on pages 28-40, (ii) in the Non-financial statement (incl. our EU taxonomy reporting) on pages 89-92, (iii) in the Corporate Governance Statement 2021 on page 67, (iv) on pages 160-162 in Note G2 'Risk and liquidity management' and (v) in the Sustainability notes on pages 313-337 which provide supplementary and more in-depth information and data related to the disclosures presented elsewhere in the Annual Report. We also present information about our materiality and impact analysis in the Sustainability notes. In addition, indices referring to our reporting in relation to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) are published as a separate appendix available at nordea.com/sustainability.\n\nAs all other disclosures in the Annual Report, the sustainability disclosures refer to the period 1 January to 31 December 2021, i.e. Nordea's financial year. The previous report was a stand-alone sustainability report covering our 2020 financial year and published in March 2020.\n\nThe sustainability disclosures have been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. Our GRI Content Index, including omission statements, is published at nordea. com/sustainability. For disclosures of financed emissions, we also use the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry provided by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).\n\nAn independent third party, PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy, has provided assurance on the sustainability information provided in this report. The scope of the assured information is indicated in the Independent practitioner's limited assurance report on page 337.\n\nThe Annual Report is available for downloading at nordea. com. If you have any questions about the sustainability disclosures, you are welcome to address them to sustainability@ nordea.com. Additional information on sustainability and also an SASB index are available at nordea.com/sustainability.\n\n## Scope of the sustainability disclosures\n\nSimilar to the financial statements, the sustainability disclosures in this Annual Report cover the parent company, Nordea Bank Abp, and its subsidiaries, i.e. the Nordea Group.  Data in the report has been gathered from all business areas and Group functions in our four Nordic countries, Poland, Estonia and Luxembourg, unless otherwise stated. This is indicated in conjunction with the presented data where we also present restatements.\n\n## Disclosure in relation to commitments and initiatives\n\nThe Annual Report is our disclosure in relation to several of the commitments and initiatives we participate in:\n\n- \u00b7 Together with the PRB Reporting and Self-Assessment Template at nordea.com, this is where we report on the implementation of the PRB.\n- \u00b7 We report climate-related information in line with the TCFD recommendations. See the TCFD Index at nordea.com/sustainability for references.\n- \u00b7 It is our Communication on Progress submission to the UN Global Compact (UNGC). See references to the UNGC Principles in the GRI Content Index at nordea.com/ sustainability.\n- \u00b7 The report serves as a description of our actions to mitigate climate change in accordance with the commitment made by Finance Finland to promoting actions aimed at limiting global warming to below 2\u00baC in our work. For a list of our association memberships, see nordea.com/sustainability.\n- \u00b7 The Annual Report considers Finance Denmark's best practice in disclosures relating to the AML area.\n- \u00b7 The sustainability information in the report partly fulfils the reporting requirements of the Equator Principles (EP). For full EP reporting, see Nordea Equator Principles Reporting at nordea.com/sustainability.\n- \u00b7 The sustainability information in the report partly fulfils the reporting requirements set out in the Responsible Ship Recycling Standards (RSRS). In addition, we publish a separate RSRS report at nordea.com/sustainability.\n- \u00b7 The sustainability information in the report partly fulfils the reporting requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act. In addition, we publish a separate modern slavery and human tra/ffi.ligacking statement at nordea.com/sustainability.",

This Standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Sustainability information is free from material misstatement.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance\n\nHelsinki, 28 February 2022\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy\n\nAuthorised Public Accountants\n\nTiina Puukkoniemi Partner, Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Sustainability Assurance and Reporting Lead\n\nJukka Paunonen Partner, Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Lead Financial Audit Partner\n\nengagement. An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other Sustainability information. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Sustainability information.\n\nOur work consisted of, amongst others, the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Interviewing a representative of senior management of the Company.\n- \u00b7 Interviewing employees responsible for collecting and reporting Sustainability information at the Group level.\n- \u00b7 Assessing how Group employees apply the reporting instructions and procedures of the Company.\n- \u00b7 Testing the accuracy and completeness of the information from original documents and systems on a sample basis.\n- \u00b7 Testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis.\n- \u00b7 Considering the disclosure and presentation of the Sustainability information.\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that Nordea Bank Abp's Sustainability information for the reporting period ended 31 December 2021 is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria.\n\nWhen reading our limited assurance report, the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of Sustainability information should be taken into consideration.\n\nOur assurance report has been prepared in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to Nordea Bank Abp for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions that we have reached.",
