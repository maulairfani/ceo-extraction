        "page_content": "## ABOUT THIS REPORT (PART OF THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT)\n\n## REPORTING CONCEPT\n\n## Integrated reporting and corporate strategy\n\nIn the BMW Group's view, a key prerequisite for a company's profitability is that its activities are compatible with external economic, ecological and social interests. Conversely, profit\u00ad ability is the prerequisite for a company's ability to develop sustainable and innovative technologies, ensure job secu rity, and cooperate with all its business partners along a value chain that is striving to become increasingly sustainable.\n\nFor this reason, since the financial year 2020, the BMW Group has kept stakeholders informed of its business performance by  reporting  on  an  integrated  basis.  With  the  Integrated Group Report 2021, we aim to provide a clear and compre\u00ad hensive insight into the BMW Group and explain our activities in a transparent, comprehensible and measurable manner. We are well aware that integrated reporting is among the subjects of an ongoing discussion currently taking place be\u00ad tween stakeholders, regulators and reporting entities. The status achieved to date is therefore still subject to constant review and continuous improvement.\n\nThe BMW Group is keen to demonstrate to its shareholders how  economic,  ecological  and  social  issues  complement one another and are often mutually dependent, and which general external conditions influence the company and de\u00ad fine our potential to boost sustainability. For these reasons, we explain the BMW Group's \u2197 corporate strategy as well as the latest developments and the way in which the business is managed on the basis of key financial and non\u00adfinancial tar\u00ad gets. \u2197 KPI Dashboard\n\nOn  8  March  2022,  the  Financial  Statements  of  BMW AG were authorised for issue by the Board of Management and the Group Financial Statements approved for publication. The BMW Group Report combines the management reports of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG) and the BMW Group in a Combined Management Report.",

        "page_content": "## Changes in reporting and outlook for reporting requirements\n\nIn light of recent and prospective changes in non\u00adfinancial disclosure requirements, including the revision of the Non\u00adFi\u00ad nancial Reporting Directive at EU level (Corporate Sustain\u00ad ability Reporting Directive), the related development of EU reporting  standards  and  the  establishment  of  the  Inter\u00ad national Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the umbrella of the \u2197 IFRS Foundation , the pace of change within the reporting environment will continue to gather momentum and increase the extent to which non\u00adfinancial and financial disclosures need to be presented on an integrated basis. The BMW Group is preparing itself for these new trends by developing its internal control system to ensure that non\u00adfi\u00ad nancial performance indicators are monitored to the same degree as financial performance indicators. In the year under report, we also complied with the disclosure requirements of the ( \u2197 EU Taxonomy ) Regulation and expanded our reporting in line with the requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex \u2197 GRI 102\u00ad48, 102\u00ad49\n\n## FRAMEWORKS APPLIED\n\nThe BMW Group Report 2021 is based on the following re\u00ad porting and accounting standards:\n\n## Combined Management Report\n\nThe Combined Management Report is based on the follow\u00ad ing legal frameworks:\n\n- - German Commercial Code (HGB) (among other relevant legislation)\n- -  Combined Non\u00adFinancial Statement (NFS) at Group and Company level in accordance with \u00a7 289 b and \u00a7 315 b HGB. \u2197 NFS\u00adIndex\n\n- -  German Accounting Standards (GASs) underpinning HGB requirements\n- - German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n- - Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020 / 852 of the European Council and of the European Parliament on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate Sustainable Investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019 / 2088)\n\nThe Combined Management Report is also based on:\n\n- - Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)\n- - German Corporate Governance Code\n\nFurthermore, the following reporting standards and trans\u00ad parency requirements have, for the most part, been integrat\u00ad ed in the Combined Management Report:\n\n- - Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) ( \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex ), option 'comprehensive'\n- - Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) ( \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex )\n- - Task  Force  on  Climate\u00adrelated  Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) ( \u2197 TCFD\u00adIndex )\n- - UN Global Compact Progress Report: see references in GRI Content Index ( \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex )\n\n## Group Financial Statements\n\nThe  Group  Financial  Statements  of  Bayerische  Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the year ended 31 December 2021 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and the supplementary requirements of \u00a7 315 e HGB.\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE REPORT\n\n## Publication and scope\n\nThe BMW Group Report is published annually to coincide with the BMW Group Annual Conference - most recently held on 17 March 2021 - and is subsequently available in both German and English on the BMW Group website. The \u2197 GRI Content Index is also available on the website as a sepa\u00ad rate document. The reporting period covers the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2021. The statements made in the report relate to the BMW Group reporting entity. Any deviations are marked accordingly. Nothing significant has changed in the reporting period with regard to the or\u00ad ganisational structure of the BMW Group. The BMW Group Report 2022 will be published on 15 March 2023.\n\n\u2197 GRI 102\u00ad45, 102\u00ad48, GRI\u00adIndex 102\u00ad52\n\n## External audit\n\nThe  entire  report  of  BMW AG,  comprising  the  Combined Management Report, the Group Financial Statements, the disclosures on corporate governance and the additional GRI information, has been subject to an annual independent au\u00ad dit by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs\u00ad gesellschaft ('PwC' or 'Auditor'). The external audit serves to underpin the reliability and trustworthiness of the infor\u00ad mation contained therein for external users. The external au\u00ad dit supports the Supervisory Board of BMW AG in fulfilling its auditing duties. Any links and / or disclosures that refer to additional information outside the BMW Group Report and the GRI Content Index are not part of the audit. The \u2197 Remuner\u00ad ation Report 2021 was prepared in accordance with the require\u00ad ments of \u00a7 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and its content audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft.",

        "page_content": "PwC has audited the Group Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report for the year ended 31 De\u00ad cember 2021 and issued an unqualified audit opinion there\u00ad upon. Further information is provided in the \u2197 Independent Audi\u00ad tor's Report and the \u2197 Independent Practitioner's Report on Non\u00adfinancial Disclosures.\n\nThe contents of the NFS, in accordance with \u00a7 289 b and \u00a7 315 b HGB, were subjected to an audit to obtain limited assurance and is denoted with the symbol \u2026 . The chapter \u2197 Dialogue with stakeholders and the additional information pro\u00ad vided in the section \u2197 Additional GRI Information were also sub\u00ad jected to a limited assurance engagement. Certain individual parts of the NFS as well as the remainder of the Combined Management Report were subjected to a reasonable assur\u00ad ance engagement. Information provided in the \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex is subjected to a limited assurance review on a voluntary basis. The \u2197 TCFD\u00adIndex refers to the corresponding chapter, in which the respective test levels are denoted.\n\n## Material topics addressed in the NFS\n\nThe material topics addressed in the NFS to ensure compli\u00ad ance with \u00a7 289 c and \u00a7 315 c HGB were determined partly on the basis of the results of the materiality analysis updated in 2018, in line with the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and partly on the basis of the BMW Group's own long\u00adterm targets. For these purposes, consideration\n\nwas given to the BMW Group's own business operations, products and services on the one hand and its business re\u00ad lationships (for example in the supply chain) on the other. In accordance  with  statutory  materiality  requirements,  infor\u00ad mation has been aggregated in each case with a view to pro\u00ad viding an understanding of the BMW Group's course of busi\u00ad ness, results of operations and financial position, while also showing the impact of its activities on the non\u00adfinancial as\u00ad pects specified in the legislation. A stakeholder survey con\u00ad ducted during the period under report with selected repre\u00ad sentatives from capital markets and academia confirmed our selection of \u2197 material topics .\n\n\u2197 GRI 102\u00ad46, 102\u00ad49\n\n## Connection to figures in the Group Financial Statements\n\nFor each topic, an assessment was carried out to identify figures reported in the financial statements that enable a better understanding of the NFS, and which therefore need to be disclosed and explained.\n\n## Forward\u00adlooking statements\n\nThe BMW Group Report 2021 contains various forward\u00adlook\u00ad ing  statements  concerning  future  developments  that  are based on the current status of the BMW Group's assumptions and forecasts. These statements are therefore subject to a va\u00ad riety of predictable and unpredictable risks, uncertainties and other factors, which means that the actual outcome, including\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat of the BMW Group's net assets, financial position and re\u00ad sults of operations, its development or performance, could differ considerably to those statements.\n\n## Editorial comments\n\nThe key figures presented in this report have been rounded in accordance with standard commercial practise. In certain cases, this may mean that figures do not add up exactly to the stated total and that percentages cannot be derived from the figures shown.\n\nThe BMW Group Report uses also the simplified term 'car\u00ad bon' or the abbreviation CO 2 instead of CO2e. Since not only carbon dioxide, but also other gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) contribute to climate warming to a varying extent, the impact is converted into so\u00adcalled CO 2 equivalents (CO2e).\n\nSummarised  disclosures  of  fuel  consumption,  carbon  emis\u00ad sions and electricity consumption are provided in the section \u2197 Consumption and carbon emissions data .",

The figure for 2019 was restated accordingly for comparison purposes (2019 before adjustment: 133,778 employees). For the period 2018 and earlier, the percentage of employees no longer covered by the new definition is between 7.5 and 8.0 %.\n- 3 The new definition of the term ' employee ' (see footnote 1) also has an impact on disclosures relating to the percentage of female employees. The 2019 figure was adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes (2019 before adjustment: 17.5 %).\n- 4 Deliveries including the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang (2017: 385,705 units, 2018: 455,581 units, 2019: 538,612 units, 2020: 602,247 units, 2021: 651,236 units).\n- 5 Retail vehicle delivery data for 2020 and 2021 are not directly comparable to the data presented for previous years. See Retail vehicle delivery data in the section \u2197 Comparison of Forecasts with Actual Outcomes for further information.\n- 6 EU\u00ad27 countries including Norway and Iceland; with effect from 2021, values are calculated on a converted basis in line with WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure). Values from 2017 to 2020 according to New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).\n- 7 This is a preliminary internal calculation with a potential variation of +/- 0.5 g CO2 / km, as official registration figures from the authorities are not available from all EU states. The EU Commission is not expected to publish official figures until November the following year.\n- 8 To improve year\u00adon\u00ad year comparability, the 2020 NEDC figures were converted to WLTP after adjusting for permissible flexibilities - specifically from 99 g CO2 / km according to NEDC (including 5 g CO2 / km phase\u00adin, 7.5 g CO2 / km supercredits and 2.4 g CO2 / km eco\u00adinnovations) to 135 g CO2 / km according to WLTP (excluding flexibilities). In 2020, a phase\u00adin regulation was accepted, as was the recognition of supercredits. As of 2021, these two simplifications no longer apply for the BMW Group.\n- 9 Flexibilities as defined in the regulatory requirements for 2021 are as follows: eco\u00adinnovation with 1.7 g CO2 / km (WLTP).\n- 10 Efficiency ratio calculated on the basis of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions (i.e. a market\u00adbased method according to GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance; mainly the use of the VDA emissions factors as well as isolated use of local emissions factors; but excluding climate\u00adchanging gases other than carbon dioxide) from vehicle pro\u00ad duction (BMW Group manufacturing sites incl. joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. and motorcycles, excluding contract manufacturers), as well as BMW Group non\u00admanufacturing sites (e.g. research centre, sales centre, offices) divided by the number of vehicles (excluding motorcycles) produced (BMW Group  manufacturing sites incl. joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., excluding contract manufacturers).\n- 11 From 2021, this indicator will include the carbon emissions of all other BMW Group locations in addition to the carbon emissions generated by production. The figures for 2019 (base year) and 2020 have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes (2019 before adjustment: 0.30 tons, 2020 before adjustment: 0.23 tons).\n- 12 Figures from 2017 and 2018 are audited with limited assurance.",

However, the prudent leadership of the Board of Management and the tremendous hard work of our employees helped make 2021 a highly successful financial year for the BMW Group. With a new record of over 2.5 million BMW brand vehicles delivered, we are now the leading manufacturer in the premium segment worldwide. With great resolve, the Board of Management continued to develop the key strategies that will shape the future of the BMW Group and create the ideal conditions for an attractive product portfolio precisely tailored to meet the needs of our customers as we move forward. The fact that we are on the right track with our  strategy was amply borne out by the enthusiastic media response to the BMW i Vision Circular at the IAA Mobility in Munich and the presentation of the BMW iX and BMW i4 models. Even in these uncertain times we therefore look to 2022 with confi\u00ad dence and will remain firmly focused on our mission of moving people with products that evoke emotions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorbert Reithofer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board",

We focused in particular on the technological trans\u00ad formation of the BMW Group's drive system technology. At each of its five meetings (including two two\u00adday meetings), the Supervisory Board held detailed discussions with the Board of Management on the BMW Group's current position. The Board of Management also kept the Supervisory Board informed of any matters of significance outside the framework of formal meetings whenever necessary. I also discussed key current matters personally with the Chairman of the Board of Management between meetings on an ongoing basis, as did the Chairman of the Audit Committee with the Board of Management member responsible for Finance.\n\nWithin the Supervisory Board and its committees, dialogues were always conduct\u00ad ed in an open and constructive spirit, both internally and together with members of the Board of Management. Members of the Supervisory Board and its committees had adequate opportunity to prepare in advance for the topics to be discussed at meetings with the aid of well\u00addocumented information provided to them. Moreover, shareholder representatives and employee representatives generally prepared for meetings in separate preliminary discussions.\n\nIn its regular reports on the BMW Group's position, the Board of Management kept us well informed regarding current developments and performance, including an in\u00addepth presentation of current sales trends based on figures analysed by market, model and drive system for both the BMW Group and its competitors, with a sharp fo\u00ad cus on electrified models and developments on the Chinese market. The reports also contained regular updates on the performance and risk profile of the Financial Ser\u00ad vices segment as well as the development of key performance indicators and liquidity for the BMW Group as a whole, highlighting deviations from the original forecast and presenting a range of scenarios for future potential developments. Updates on the current status of semiconductor supply issues were also provided at every meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe monitoring of corporate strategy remained high on the Supervisory Board's agenda. The Board of Management provided a comprehensive account of its strategy with a particular focus on sustainability, including detailed key objectives, regionally differentiated approaches and specific strategies for each of the Group's divisions. It also briefed us on the state of progress in terms of electrification, digital\u00ad isation, sustainability and circularity and explained the customer\u00adcentric, future\u00adori\u00ad ented strategy adopted for the BMW brand. Against the backdrop of stricter carbon emissions regulations across all major markets, the Board of Management provided us with details of the BMW Group's ambitious decarbonisation targets up to the year 2030. The latest aspects of vehicle digitalisation, ranging from digital operating systems and driver assistance technologies to personalised digital experiences, were also thoroughly explained to us in a presentation, which also focused on differing customer expectations in various markets as well as the importance of digital fea\u00ad tures as a key purchasing criterion, particularly in the strategically important market of China. We also held a detailed discussion on the technological challenges posed for vehicle, environment and drivers when developing automated driving beyond Lev\u00ad el 3. A Supervisory Board member with in\u00addepth expertise in this field provided us with additional insight into the future of automated driving as well as the importance of agile software integration in BMW Group vehicles. At each meeting, the Board of Management reported on its strategy\u00adrelated work as well as on the current status of implementation.\n\nIt also kept us well informed about current topics of significance, including the establishing of QUATAC, a consortium promoting the use of quantum computing in industrial settings, the successful presentation of the BMW Group at the IAA Mobility in Munich, the highly encouraging results of the employee survey, the BMW Group's participation in the start\u00adup company Solid Power, which specialises in solid\u00adstate battery cells, and the expansion of the IONITY network for premium charging sta\u00ad tions using 100 % green power.\n\nOn the basis of a thorough examination, we considered the impact of changes in legislation and regulations on the BMW Group, in particular the Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains, the Act on Strengthening Financial Market Integrity (FISG) and the new European exhaust emissions standard (Euro 7).",

        "page_content": "Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nWe also spent considerable time deliberating on the antitrust proceedings instigated by the EU Commission in connection with the former working groups of several Ger\u00ad man automobile manufacturers. In this context, we consulted with external attorneys and an antitrust advisor engaged directly by the Supervisory Board. We were kept well informed about the latest status of the proceedings at all times. In May 2021, af\u00ad ter the EU Commission significantly scaled down its charges in terms of content and timing, the BMW Group was able to reverse approximately \u20ac 1 billion of the \u20ac 1.4 bil\u00ad lion provision recognised in 2019. After the proceedings were concluded in July 2021 with the payment of a fine amounting to around \u20ac 373 million, the Supervisory Board carefully considered the question of potential personal responsibility on the part of former Board of Management members and any duty of the Supervisory Board to act. The Supervisory Board also obtained advice on this issue from an attorney, whose written findings were also explained to us personally at the relevant meeting. Based on this report and taking into account the supplementary explanations pro\u00ad vided by the antitrust advisor, also regarding the legal particularities of the antitrust proceedings, the Supervisory Board decided - after thorough discussion and on the recommendation of the Audit Committee - not to assert any claims against former members of the Board of Management of BMW AG in this context.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also deliberated at length on key issues arising within the Board of Management's various key areas of responsibility. We were given an insight into working methods and working environments at the BMW Group currently being developed in conjunction with the 'Connected Works' project.\n\nThe Board of Management familiarised us with the NEUE KLASSE, which will herald the third phase of the BMW Group's transformation to electric mobility from 2025 onwards and set new standards in terms of digitalisation, electrification and sus\u00ad tainability in vehicles. We took a detailed look at the key features of the New Cluster Vehicle Architecture (NCVA), which is specifically geared towards all\u00adelectric vehicles. Furthermore, the Board of Management elucidated potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in production planning processes. The Financial Services segment was also included in our deliberations, particularly in light of positive developments in terms of its risk profile and the pre\u00adowned vehicle market. Key topics relating to the Group's corporate finance system were also discussed. Regarding sales markets we focused in particular on Asia as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board of Management reported on the current status of the diversity concepts developed by the Group and the extent to which targets have been achieved regard\u00ad ing the proportion of women employed at various levels.\n\nWe also addressed the topic of compliance within the BMW Group in depth, including the current status and ongoing developments. The Chief Compliance Officer pre\u00ad sented the annual report on compliance, including compliance targets and a number of other selected topics, focusing in particular on measures and processes aimed at improving the Group's compliance management system on a continuous basis.\n\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic and the accompanying restrictions on events involving large numbers of people, in March 2021 we agreed on a plan to hold the Annual General Meeting 2021 on a virtual basis. For the same reason, in December 2021, we approved the plan to hold the Annual General Meeting 2022 again in a virtual format.\n\nStrategic cooperations were again a key topic at Supervisory Board meetings in 2021, including in particular the positioning of the BMW Group in the vital Chinese market going forward and the future structure of the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint ven\u00ad ture. We also deliberated on the intended acquisition of shares in Brilliance Automo\u00ad tive Manufacturing. The Board of Management updated us regularly on the strategic positioning and status at the various YOUR NOW companies.\n\nThe new remuneration system resolved by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Board of Management during the previous financial year came into effect on 1 January 2021 and was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 2021 with a majority of 91.6 % of valid votes. The Supervisory Board reviewed both the targeted and the expected level of Board of Management remuneration for the financial year 2021 in light of the BMW Group's business performance and also the multi\u00adyear remuneration trend of its senior executives and employees in Germany. Based on a comparative study conducted by an external remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that the remuneration of Board of Man\u00ad agement members is appropriate. In December 2021, following thorough preparation by the Personnel Committee, we adopted the variable remuneration component tar\u00ad gets applicable to Board of Management members for the financial year 2022, taking into account the budget for the financial year 2022, the long\u00adterm business plan and",

Detailed information on Board of Management remuneration is provided in the \u2197 Remuneration Report .\n\nThe new remuneration system, which gives the Supervisory Board greater influence on corporate strategy implementation was also the focus of one\u00adon\u00adone discussions with investor representatives ahead of the Annual General Meeting 2021. Other topics discussed on these occasions included corporate\u00adgovernance\u00adrelated issues, such as succession planning for future appointments to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board exhaustively examined the long\u00adterm business plan for the period up to 2027, the framework for which and the ambitious long\u00adterm targets con\u00ad tained therein were presented by the Board of Management. Despite the prevailing volatile and uncertain conditions, the Board of Management reaffirmed the key target of achieving continuous growth, with a clear focus on the Group's planned sales of all\u00adelectric models. The long\u00adterm business plan also included financial planning and various potential scenarios, each involving their own opportunities and risks. Following this thorough examination, the Supervisory Board approved the long\u00adterm business plan for the BMW Group.\n\nIn December, the Board of Management presented the budget for the financial year 2022, including HR planning. After detailed deliberations with the Board of Manage\u00ad ment on this subject, the Supervisory Board also gave its approval to this document.\n\nWe reviewed our contribution to ensuring good corporate governance within the BMW Group and implemented changes concerning individual aspects. For example, in order to ensure compliance with the Act on Strengthening Financial Market Integ\u00ad ri ty, a number of changes were made to the Supervisory Board's rules of procedure, a copy of which is published on the BMW website. Based on a self\u00adassessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board at 31 December 2021 was in line with the targets stipulated in the diversity concept, the competency profile and other composition targets. An overview showing each individual Supervisory Board member's areas of expertise is provided in the Statement of Corporate Governance on the BMW Group website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn December, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board issued their Dec\u00ad laration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code. We will comply with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 16 December 2019, again without exception.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board jointly attended various training events in 2021. In July, for instance, we took the opportunity to familiarise ourselves thoroughly with battery cell technology. After an introductory presentation by the Board of Man\u00ad agement covering various related topics, we visited the BMW Group Battery Cell Com\u00ad petence Centre in Munich, where we had the opportunity to listen to an internationally renowned researcher giving a talk on lithium\u00adion batteries, followed by a discussion of the future of battery cell technology. In the newly constructed part of the Research and Innovation Centre in Munich, we were given a guided tour to gain an insight into the various new working environments. Partly with the Wirecard case in mind, coopera\u00ad tion between supervisory boards, audit committees and auditors was the subject of a workshop conducted by representatives of the BMW Group's auditors PwC.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board also visited the BMW and MINI Driving Academy in Maisach together, in order to take an in\u00addepth look at how the Group's product portfolio can be best aligned to meet differing customer needs. The members of the Supervisory Board were given the opportunity to test\u00addrive the full range of vehicle types, comprising all\u00adelectric, plug\u00adin hybrid and conventionally powered vehicles as well as the BMW iX5 Hydrogen, which is powered by hydrogen fuel cell technology. A particular highlight was the unveiling of the new BMW 7 Series, the only model in its segment to offer customers a choice between an internal com\u00ad bustion engine and an all\u00adelectric drive system in the form of the BMW i7. Apart from BMW, MINI and Rolls\u00adRoyce brand vehicles and a joint venture product, we also took test drives in various competitor vehicles. Design presentations covering the BMW, MINI, Rolls\u00adRoyce and BMW Motorrad brands as well as the BMW i Vision Circular allowed us to take a fascinating look into the future.\n\nNew members of the Supervisory Board were given the opportunity to participate in an onboarding programme comprising several modules, during which senior execu\u00ad tives provided useful insights into key business areas and planning processes used at the BMW Group as well as on key topics currently relevant for Supervisory Board work.",

        "page_content": "Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nThroughout the entire year, personal conversations with members of the Supervisory Board enabled me to gather feedback concerning the work of the Supervisory Board. At the end of 2021, we also assessed the effectiveness of our work at both Supervis\u00ad ory Board and committee level by means of a questionnaire and concluded that there was a high level of satisfaction with the work of the Supervisory Board. The feedback we received on the organisation of our meetings as well as the topics covered in meetings, training sessions and onboarding events was unanimously favourable. The constructive and trusting cooperation prevailing both within the Supervisory Board itself and in its work with the Board of Management was also commended. Proposals put forward for improving individual aspects of Supervisory Board work and dealing with certain topics in greater depth will be followed up in the coming financial year.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is careful to avoid potential conflicts of interest in its delib\u00ad erations and decisions. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, I did not take part in the Supervisory Board's deliberations and resolution and the preparation of the Audit Committee's recommendation to the Supervisory Board on whether claims should be asserted against former members of the Board of Management in connection with the EU Commission's antitrust proceedings against German automakers. I left the room whenever these matters came up for discussion. No other potential conflicts of interest were identified or reported.\n\n## Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work\n\nThe Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. In our capacity as chairmen, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr. Bock, and myself reported in detail on the work of the Presiding Committee and the committees at each of the subsequent Supervisory Board meetings. You can read more about the duties, the composition and the working methods of the Presiding Board and various other Supervisory Board committees in the Statement of Corporate Governance on the BMW website.\n\nThe Presiding Board held four meetings during the financial year 2021. Together with the Board of Management and senior heads of department, we prepared the detailed agenda of Supervisory Board meetings (unless a committee was responsible for doing so) and made suggestions for topics to be reported on at Supervisory Board meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Audit Committee held five meetings and three conference calls during the year under report.\n\nThe meetings held in February and March 2021 focused on preparing the Superviso\u00ad ry Board meeting at which the financial statements for the financial year 2020 were discussed and examined. After obtaining the auditor's Declaration of Independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board that Pricewaterhouse\u00ad Coopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft ('PwC') be proposed for election as auditor at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. There were no indications of conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor.\n\nAfter thorough deliberation, the Audit Committee concluded that PwC's fee proposal for the audit of the Company and Group Financial Statements and the integrated BMW Group Report 2021 as well as for the review of the Half\u00adYear Report 2021 was appropriate in light of the growing scope of tasks and issued the corresponding contracts to PwC following their election at the Annual General Meeting in May 2021. The Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas and approved the scope of non\u00adaudit services to be provided by PwC and subsequently received regular reports on the relevant matters. The Audit Committee discussed the quality of the audit in detail on several occasions at its meetings. In particular, it requested the relevant department to report on the Group's perception of the audits of the financial statements for the financial year 2020 as well as on the results of the survey con\u00ad ducted within the Group in this context. Based on this report, the auditor's description of the quality assurance measures undertaken and the Audit Committee's own expe\u00ad rience with the auditor, the audit was found to be of good quality.\n\nThe Board of Management presented the combined Non\u00adfinancial Statement of BMW AG and the BMW Group for the financial year 2020 to us. Subsequently, the representatives of PwC reported to us orally on the results of their 'limited assur\u00ad ance' audit. We have engaged PwC again to conduct a 'limited assurance' audit of the Non\u00adfinancial (Group) Statement for the financial year 2021, to the extent that it relates to parts of the management report that are not subject to a 'reasonable assurance' audit. Going beyond the formal review required by law, the Audit Commit\u00ad tee also engaged PwC to perform additional review procedures on the content of the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2021.",

        "page_content": "Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Quarterly Statements were presented by the Board of Management and dis\u00ad cussed with the Audit Committee prior to their publication. Representatives of the external auditors were present when the Half\u00adYear Financial Report was discussed at the beginning of August 2021. In conjunction with the implementation of the requirements of the Act on Strengthening Financial Market Integrity, an executive session was also held with the external auditor without the members of the Board of Manage ment being present.\n\nThe Audit Committee again dealt extensively with the topic of compliance within the BMW Group during the year under report. The Chief Compliance Officer of the BMW Group presented the annual report on compliance, including compliance targets and a number of other selected topics, focusing in particular on measures and pro\u00ad cesses aimed at improving the Group's compliance management system on a contin\u00ad uous basis. The Head of Corporate Quality also reported on the subject of technical compliance. We also received a report on the status of tax and customs compliance management from the relevant head of department.\n\nThe Audit Committee was kept informed of major legal disputes and proceedings. During the first two quarters of 2021, the Committee spent considerable time dealing with the antitrust proceedings instigated by the EU Commission in connection with the former working groups of several German automobile manufacturers, carefully monitoring the progress of proceedings based on various inputs, including direct reports drawn up by a lawyer appointed to represent the BMW Group. After the pro\u00ad ceedings were concluded, with the assistance of the consultant attorney and based on his detailed report, the Audit Committee drew up a recommendation to the Super\u00ad visory Board on the question of whether to assert claims against former members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Audit Committee also received reports on the further development of the internal control system and the main findings of the internal audits performed by Corporate Audit, as well as details of advance audit planning. The BMW Group's risk profile and risk management system were discussed on a number of occasions.\n\nIn its report on the audit of over\u00adthe\u00adcounter derivatives entered into by BMW AG during the financial year 2020, the external auditor confirmed to the Audit Committee the effectiveness of the system in place at BMW AG in complying with the regulatory requirements of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Audit Committee concurred with the decision of the Board of Management to raise the Company's share capital in accordance with Article 4 (5) of the Articles of Incorporation (Authorised Capital 2019) by \u20ac 1,715,000 and issue a corresponding number of new non\u00advoting bearer shares of preferred stock in conjunction with the Employee Share Programme.\n\nAt its four meetings, the Personnel Committee focused primarily on succession planning for the Board of Management, preparing personnel\u00adrelated decisions and dealing with Board of Management remuneration issues. The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of Board of Management remuneration for the financial years 2020 and 2021 and considered all relevant developments during that period, includ\u00ad ing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, when determining the corporate earn\u00ad ings and performance factors applicable for Board of Management remuneration in 2020 and 2021. In addition, the Committee deliberated on targets for the financial year 2022. The Personnel Committee also prepared reappointments, performed the groundwork for the Supervisory Board to appoint a Board of Management member responsible for the Purchasing and Supplier Network, and granted approval for one member of the Board of Management to assume a mandate outside the Group. A resolution to approve loans granted by and transactions concluded by BMW Bank GmbH with members of the representative bodies of BMW AG was renewed, and updated contracts of Board of Management members were prepared.\n\nThe Nomination Committee convened twice during the financial year 2021. Taking into account the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and the composition requirements adopted by the Supervisory Board, the Nomination Committee ad\u00ad dressed the issue of the composition of the Supervisory Board regarding shareholder representatives.\n\nThe Mediation Committee , which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the financial year 2021.\n\n## Composition of the Board of Management\n\nDr.\u00adIng. Andreas Wendt, Board of Management member for the Purchasing and Supplier Network, retired on 31 December 2021. We would like to thank Dr. Wendt for his many years of loyal and dedicated work for BMW AG, most recently for guiding the BMW Group successfully through the ongoing semiconductor shortage.",

The auditor's long\u00adform audit reports were also made available to the Supervisory Board in a prompt manner.\n\nAt its meeting on 9 March 2022, the Audit Committee diligently examined and de\u00ad liberated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of the Supervisory Board on 10 March 2022.\n\nAt the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided the Audit Com\u00ad mittee and the Supervisory Board with detailed explanations of the financial reports presented. The representatives of the external auditor present at the meetings reported on the main findings of their audit and answered additional questions put by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. The focus of these meetings was on key audit matters as well as the related audit procedures, which were discussed at length by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe representatives of the external auditor confirmed that the risk management system established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying at an early stage any developments that might threaten the Company's going\u00adconcern status. They also confirmed that that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system were identified with regard to the financial reporting process. Similarly, in the course of their audit work they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the contents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.",

In accordance with the final result of this examination, no objections were raised. The Group and Com\u00ad pany Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the financial year 2021 drawn by the Board of Management were subsequently approved at our meeting held on 10 March 2022. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 have therefore been adopted.\n\nWe also examined the proposal of the Board of Management to use the unappro\u00ad priated profit to pay a dividend of \u20ac 5.80 per share of common stock and \u20ac 5.82 per share of non\u00advoting preferred stock, in each case on shares entitled to receive a divi\u00ad dend. We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore given it our approval.\n\nFor the financial year 2021, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management have prepared the Remuneration Report for the first time in accordance with \u00a7 162 AktG (ARUG II / Act Implementing the Second EU Shareholder Rights Directive). At the request of the Audit Committee, PwC reviewed the content of the Remuneration Report, reported to both the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board on the results of the review, and confirmed that the Remuneration Report complies in all material respects with the financial reporting provisions contained in \u00a7 162 AktG.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also considered at length the com\u00ad bined Non\u00adfinancial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2021, which was drawn up by the Board of Management as part of the integrated BMW Group Report. Following an in\u00addepth explanation of the statement by the Board of Man\u00ad agement, representatives of the external auditor presented key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the members of the Supervisory Board. Based on the 'limited assurance' audit performed by PwC on those parts of the Management Report that were not subject to a reasonable assurance engagement, PWC issued an unqualified opinion, signed for the sixth time by Andreas Fell and for the second time by Nicolette Behncke. The Supervisory Board acknowledged and approved the combined Non\u00adfinancial (Group) Statement drawn up by the Board of Management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board\n\nWe would like to express our thanks and appreciation to the members of the Board of Management and all employees of the BMW Group worldwide for their outstand\u00ad ing performance in the financial year 2021. With their unbending commitment, even under adverse conditions, and a fine collective performance, they have taken the BMW Group to the top of the global premium segment over the past 12\u00admonth period and additionally enhanced the Group's profile as a guarantor of first\u00adclass individual and sustainable mobility.\n\nWe are confident that the Board of Management and the Group's entire workforce, with their courage and confidence, will write the next chapter of the BMW Group's unique success story in 2022.\n\nMunich, March 2022\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Norbert Reithofer\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board",

This applies in particular, and in its own unique way, to the current transformation.\n\nYour Company has held its own in the marketplace for over 100 years. Yet, far more important than that is staying resolutely focused on the future - with the support and backing of a motivated team, shareholders and stakeholders. All of you want to know why the BMW Group should continue to exist 100 years from now.\n\nWe want to make a difference. To create the values our customers ask for. To gener\u00ad ate meaningful added value. That is part of our responsibility - because our society depends on people's mobility and benefits from it.\n\n## The BMW Group exists because we move body, heart and mind.\n\nThat is our internal compass. It guides us - even now, through the many changes we must navigate as a BMW Group team - with focus and self\u00adassurance. Transform\u00ad ation is part of our DNA - and we all aspire to lead the way. We presented our most recent example of this last year at the IAA Mobility in Munich: the BMW i Vision Cir\u00ad cular, a car that moves body, heart and mind. With this extraordinary Vision Vehicle, BMW has clearly defined the next big future topic of 'circularity' for itself. Imagine what we could achieve if we begin thinking consequently about circularity at both business and macroeconomic levels - and across industries.\n\n## Your Company presents its second Integrated Report.\n\nWe lead the way in the German automotive industry with our integrated reporting of the Company's financial and non\u00adfinancial performance.\n\nThis is a new step for us - consistent and irreversible. Integrated reporting is a pro\u00ad cess that involves and challenges the whole Company. It requires integrated thinking: what is the impact of a decision as a whole - from both a business and an environmental perspective, in the short term, mid\u00adterm and in the long term?\n\n'BMW has clearly defined the next big future topic of circularity for itself with the BMW i Vision  Circular.'",

        "page_content": "Statement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\n\nThis is a complex task, and we will continue to learn. Our second Integrated Report for the financial year 2021 reflects this learning process. The 'Integrated Strategy of the BMW Group' section provides a qualified insight into how strategy and our man\u00ad agement of the Company are intertwined.\n\n## Holistic sustainability based on concrete targets.\n\nWe have announced clearly defined targets for 2030 that show how we will continue to lower CO 2 emissions. As our shareholders, you know that your Company always takes a holistic approach. We are therefore substantially reducing our environmen\u00ad tal footprint in a measurable way throughout the entire value chain - during the use phase, in production and in the upstream supply chain. Here, we are adopting a ten\u00ad year perspective - because this is a manageable time frame, in which we can take responsibility for measures ourselves. We do not believe in empty promises. We are able to report at any given time on how we are performing in all three sustainability scopes.\n\nWe are the first German automotive manufacturer to join the 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0 C' campaign launched by the Science\u00adBased Targets initiative (SBTi). This means our road to climate neutrality follows a scientifically validated and trans\u00ad parent path.\n\nSince most of our CO 2 emissions today are produced during the use phase, we have raised the bar in this area: By 2030, we will reduce CO 2 emissions by more than 50 % from 2019 levels. Our targets apply worldwide, including the extra 10 % from the SBTi framework added to fuel consumption figures and including CO 2 emissions from fuel production and electricity generation. This will in turn also reduce our life cycle carbon footprint - from the ore mine to kilometres driven on the road - by more than 40 %.\n\n## Building credibility by keeping promises.\n\nWe deliver on our promises - and can back them up. In 2021, your Company once again met the European Union's CO 2 targets - even clearly outperforming the legal requirements by approximately 10 g / km. You can rest assured that we will also meet our CO 2 requirements for 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn production, well\u00addesigned individual steps ultimately contribute to overall sustain\u00ad ability as well: as promised, production at all our locations has been carbon neutral on balance since 2021. Our electric motors no longer require rare earths. We use only green power to produce batteries for our electrified vehicles - as do our battery cell suppliers. Our batteries are also almost fully recyclable. All of this is relevant for ramping up electromobility. After all, this year, every one of our plants in Germany will already be producing electric vehicles.\n\n## Change makes us resilient.\n\nWe never stand still - because we are constantly refining our business model. This strengthens our resilience, building on a solid foundation created by profitability and sustainable action. We believe the two go hand in hand and are mutually dependent.\n\n## Confident even in uncertain times.\n\nLooking forward confidently even in uncertain times. This characterises your Com\u00ad pany. Our products are in high demand: More than 2.52 million customers took delivery of a BMW Group vehicle in 2021 - 8.4 % more than the previous year. This number includes almost 330,000 electrified vehicles - an increase of 70 %.\n\nThe BMW brand is back on top of the global premium segment - and we intend to keep it that way. BMW and Rolls\u00adRoyce achieved new all\u00adtime highs, as well as BMW Motorrad. Global market share is also an important currency in our industry. As a premium manufacturer, we increased our share of the global market to 3.4 % during the coronavirus pandemic - and with a further increase in profitability. Sales in key individual markets and regions - China, Europe and the US - grew significantly in some cases. Our Financial Services Segment also made a major contribution to our success.\n\n## Staying flexible and pivoting quickly.\n\nYour Company operates at the intersection of conflicting forces, where conditions are not only demanding, but also highly complex. The situation is becoming more and more differentiated from one region of the world to another, with a highly dynamic rate of change. In this context, it is more important than ever to anticipate require\u00ad ments in the early stages, plan for various scenarios and manage risks effectively.",

In typical BMW tradition, and in the spirit of Herbert Quandt, the Company and its employee representatives once again found flexible solutions. The vaccination cam\u00ad paign we launched together is a good example of this. For our locations in Germany, we have made the BMW pension scheme even more attractive and increased the level of benefits. At the plant in Leipzig, work hours have been brought into line with our Bavarian locations. This shows our sense of community at BMW in difficult times.\n\nWe also responded extremely flexibly to semiconductor supply bottlenecks. This is a stress test we have withstood together. All business units are working hand in hand to minimise the impact and adjust production to the situation. Our stable and trust\u00ad based relationships with suppliers have proved especially valuable in this respect. We can expect, and are preparing for, the global supply situation for vehicle components to remain difficult in 2022.\n\n## Transformation takes place not just on greenfield sites or around the confe\u00ad rence table - but on the ground at our plants.\n\nWe are expanding our production network globally and in a targeted manner. For instance in China: in Shenyang, we will be opening a new plant in Tiexi this year and expanding the plant in Dadong.\n\nWe have mastered both competence development from the ground up and how to transform existing plants into cutting\u00adedge locations for electromobility. Examples of this are our two 'bookends': our oldest plant, Munich, and our future plant in Hungary.\n\nOur main plant in Munich will be 100 years old this year. To mark the centenary, we are smoothly transitioning to 100 % electric during ongoing production. With its new vehicle assembly, the plant will be capable of producing only fully electric models from 2026 onwards in line with demand. In parallel, we are also working on emis\u00ad sions\u00adfree transport logistics. That is what transformation looks like on the ground.\n\nIn 2022, as a sort of counterpart to our main plant in Munich, we will also be laying the foundation stone for our newest plant in Hungary. The first vehicles for the NEUE KLASSE will come off the production line in Debrecen in 2025.",

It will be built on our New Cluster Architecture (NCAR), with the three core forward\u00adlooking elements: 'electric', 'digital' and 'circular'. This will be the next milestone in BMW history for future products, technologies and new ways of working. The NEUE KLASSE makes a significant contribution to sustainability, by relying on the concept of circularity.\n\n## Your Company is leveraging the opportunities and potential of global auto\u00ad motive markets.\n\nOur intelligent vehicle architectures enable us to offer different drivetrain variants efficiently. This benefits customers and the climate alike. We serve markets according to their individual circumstances and pace of change. In the mid\u00adterm, this will also include hydrogen fuel cell technology - because hydrogen makes it possible to store sustainably produced energy and release it just as quickly as conventional fuels.\n\n## New BMW 7 Series: the only luxury sedan to offer drivetrain variety.\n\nAll of us at BMW are looking forward to the market launch of the new BMW 7 Series this year: progressive, digital and innovative, it is also the only luxury sedan to offer customers a choice of drivetrain variants. By the way, the most powerful variant - the BMW i7 - is fully electric. In April, we will present it in New York, Munich and Beijing, representing the major regions of the world.\n\n## E\u00admobility shifts into sport mode.\n\nOur new BMW iX and BMW i4 models are already winning over customers with their innovations and an electric range of up to 600 kilometres. With the BMW iX, we are also the first premium manufacturer to introduce the 5G mobile telecommunications standard in a production vehicle that is available worldwide. Both models are among the eight fully electric vehicle models we will have on the roads this year; by 2023, there will be a dozen.\n\nWe already aim to at least double our sales of battery\u00adelectric vehicles this year com\u00ad pared to 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy 2025 - the end of Phase II of our transformation - we aim to increase the total share of our electrified vehicles, that means battery\u00adelectric and plug\u00adin hybrids, to more than 30 %. By 2030 - the end of Phase III - more than 50 % of our global deliveries to customers should be fully electric. We are gearing up the Company and our supply chains for this exponential growth in electromobility.\n\nMINI and Rolls\u00adRoyce will be exclusively all\u00adelectric from the early 2030s onwards, while all BMW Motorrad's urban models will be released with e\u00addrives only from 2030. BMW M GmbH has also unveiled its first fully electric model, the BMW iX M60.\n\n## Merging the digital and the physical experience.\n\nThe modern car is not only one of the most complex items we use as consumers; it is also becoming a true digital device. It should therefore come as no surprise that digi\u00ad tal business models will account for a growing share of value creation. This applies, in particular, to the Chinese market, with its many young, technophile customers.\n\n## Over\u00adthe\u00adair updates: BMW has the largest fleet.\n\nYour Company has around 10,000 IT and software specialists working on research and development for vehicle digitalisation at ten locations in Europe, Asia and the Americas. We are collaborating in the regions with major tech players, who are also our competitors.\n\nAt the CES tech show in Las Vegas in January 2022, our BMW iX Flow, featuring E Ink, received rave reviews from the media and on social media. This unique technol\u00ad ogy allows the exterior to change colour.\n\n## Focused on the customer and their mobility experience.\n\nBy 2025, a quarter of our sales will probably be conducted online. That is why our Sales and Marketing is seamlessly integrating all customer touchpoints, online and offline. We are implementing future\u00adoriented sales structures in conjunction with our retailers. That is our culture at BMW.",

Its business activities have a major impact on the environment in which it operates and can have both a direct and an indirect bearing on the interests of a wide var\u00ad iety of stakeholders. Conversely, societal trends and devel\u00ad opments can influence many aspects of the Group's busi\u00ad ness  activities.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  BMW Group maintains a continuous dialogue with its stakeholders world\u00ad wide.\n\nOur commitment to stakeholder engagement is set out in the \u2197 BMW Group Stakeholder Engagement Policy , which outlines both the dialogue objectives and the criteria for identifying and priori\u00ad tising stakeholders. A variety of suitable dialogue formats and forms of communication are described in internal guide\u00ad lines. Key topics and formats are summarised below \u2197 GRI 102\u00ad42, 102\u00ad43, 102\u00ad46 .\n\n## Material topics in 2021\n\nThe BMW Group's interaction with stakeholders includes top\u00ad ics brought to its attention by stakeholders as well as those in which it proactively engages in dialogue. This combination gives rise to a comprehensive range of interlinked topics: \u2197 GRI 102\u00ad44\n\n- - The Paris Climate Agreement and climate neutrality of the BMW Group by 2050\n- - Circularity and circular design, the use of secondary ma\u00ad terials, particularly in relation to battery recycling\n- - Social responsibility for employees\n- - Environmental and social standards and respect for human rights in the supply chain, particularly regarding the pro\u00ad curement of raw materials for electric mobility applications\n- - Sustainable financing and the EU taxonomy\n- - Responsible leadership\n- - Emissions limits without excluding individual drive tech\u00ad nologies and vehicle concepts\n- - Continued development of the regulatory framework for automated driving and digital networks\n- - Support for new efficiency\u00adenhancing technologies\n- - Realistic  relationship  between  emissions  targets  and emissions measurement methods\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Consistency between supply\u00adside and demand\u00adside de\u00ad carbonisation policies\n- - Ensuring a sufficient supply of critical raw materials\n\n## BMW Group Xchange\n\nThe BMW Group Xchange encompasses all the well\u00adestab\u00ad lished forms of events organised by the Group, such as the BMW Group  Dialogues,  the  rad\u00b0hub  and  the  FUTURE FORUM, providing the appropriate platforms to encourage an intensive dialogue with a variety of target groups.\n\n\u2197 BMW Group Dialogues are one of the main formats for interact\u00ad ing with stakeholders and have been held regularly since 2011.  Major  topics  covered  in  recent  years  have  included electric mobility, corporate citizenship, urban mobility, envir\u00ad onmental and social standards within the supply chain, and circularity, i. e. the transformation from a linear to a circular economy with increasingly closed material cycles \u2197 Resource efficiency, circular economy and renewable energy .\n\nBMW Group Dialogues are usually held in the BMW Group's key sales regions of North America, Europe and Asia on an annual basis. The results of these stakeholder dialogues are documented  and  incorporated  in  the  Group's  strategic considerations \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 102\u00ad21 .",

        "page_content": "Dialogue with Stakeholders\n\n## Participation in public policy development and work in associations\n\nThe BMW Group maintains an active, open and transparent dialogue with representatives of politics, trade unions, asso\u00ad ciations and non\u00adgovernmental organisations (NGOs). The aim is to play a constructive and transparent role in helping shape the general political framework regarding the Group's business activities.\n\nApart from its own activities in the area of public policy de\u00ad velopment, the BMW Group is a member of numerous asso\u00ad ciations in various countries. Membership is voluntary in the majority  of  cases,  although  there  are  some  situations  in which it is necessary to join associations in order to comply with legal requirements.\n\n\u2197 BMW Group Lobbying Policy\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2021,  the  BMW Group  assumed  the presi dency of ACEA, the Association of European Automo\u00ad bile  Manufacturers  (Association  des  Constructeurs  Eu\u00ad rop\u00e9ens d'Automobiles). In December 2021, it was confirmed that the BMW Group will continue to chair the association for a further year (2022).\n\nIn the interest of transparency, the BMW Group always dis\u00ad closes the most important association memberships on its website \u2197 BMW Group List of Memberships .\n\n## Financial market presence with sustainability credentials\n\nRegular,  in\u00addepth  communication  with  the  capital  market has always been given a high priority within the BMW Group. In the meantime, sustainability has become a decisive cri\u00ad terion on financial markets. Furthermore, investors and fi\u00ad nancial analysts alike are increasingly considering environ\u00ad mental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  aspects  in  their investment  recommendations  and  decision\u00admaking  pro\u00ad cesses.\n\nAgainst the background of the Paris Climate Agreement, pol\u00ad icymakers in Europe are also increasingly addressing the is\u00ad sues of climate protection and sustainability. For example, the EU Action Plan for Sustainable Finance aims to direct capital flows towards sustainable economic activities. A key element of the EU Action Plan is the introduction of a stand\u00ad ardised system to classify what is sustainable and what is not. \u2197 EU Taxonomy\n\nSince 2019, sustainability criteria have also been a major factor for the BMW Group's pension fund investment strate\u00ad gy. The current focus is on measuring the carbon footprint of significant parts of these assets on the one hand and the risks attached to their future performance on the other. The BMW Group aims to achieve carbon neutrality with respect to its pension plan assets by 2050 at the latest.\n\nWe currently record carbon emissions associated with all our equity  investments  and  a  significant  proportion  of  our fixed\u00adincome assets. The relevant emissions data are includ\u00ad ed in the TCFD Report relating to our UK pension plan, which is required to be prepared annually in line with legislation that came into force in 2021 for larger\u00adscale UK pension schemes.\n\nIn addition, standard benchmarks for measuring the invest\u00ad ment  performance  of  liquid  assets  were  revised  again  in 2021 with the aid of ESG\u00adoriented indices.\n\nThe volume of non\u00adliquid pension plan assets invested in our various impact funds continues to grow according to sched\u00ad ule. The investments made to date in this area relate not only to climate protection, but also to other Sustainable De\u00ad velopment Goals (SDGs) set by the UN. In 2021, the focus of investment was on making cities more sustainable and ad\u00ad dressing the consequences of climate change.",

Apart from direct dialogue, the BMW Group's participation in (virtual) SRI / ESG roadshows and conferences is again planned.\n\nMoreover, plans are in place for the coming year to expand the scope of recording the carbon emissions associated with our investments, with the primary aim of reliably assessing and transparently documenting the compatibility of our in\u00ad vestments  with  the  climate  goals  enshrined  in  the  Paris Agreement. To the extent possible, our aim is to take account of non\u00adliquid investments in the Group's reporting on sus\u00ad tainability, or at least for all such investments to be reviewed from a sustainability perspective.\n\nThe BMW Group will continue developing its own dialogue options on an ongoing basis. We also intend to broaden the scope of internal dialogue with employees in 2022 ( \u2197 Employ\u00ad ees and society ). In addition, we plan to participate in a variety of public discussion formats going forward.\n\n## STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND FORMS OF DIALOGUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Surveys (including a corporate reputation study), social media, trade fairs, mass media                                                                          | Customers                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dialogue with employees and managers, employee surveys, idea management, internal media Employees                                                                |                                                                            |\n| Capital market                                                                                                                                                   | Dialogue, conferences and technology workshops with investors and analysts |\n| Dialogue in the context of industry initiatives, joint events, training courses, presentations, supplier risk assessments                                        | Suppliers                                                                  |\n| Business partners                                                                                                                                                | Dialogue with sales organisations and coordinating units of importers      |\n| Participation of Company experts in committees and working groups, memberships of initiatives and associations                                                   | Networks and associations                                                  |\n| Available to answer questions from policymakers and provide information to political decision makers on relevant topics from the company's perspective Political | decision makers                                                            |\n| Visiting universities and colleges, talks, discussions, dialogue events with students                                                                            | Academia                                                                   |\n| Dialogue within the context of press trips, press releases, information events on new products, test drives, trade fairs Media                                   |                                                                            |\n| Local stakeholders                                                                                                                                               | Discussions with local residents, plant tours, press engagements           |\n| Civil society and NGOs                                                                                                                                           | Face\u00adto\u00adface meetings / dialogue, responding to enquiries                    |\n\n\u2197 GRI 102\u00ad40, 102\u00ad43\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, in light of the generally improved situation, upward adjustments were made over the course of 2021.\n\nIn this context, Moody's raised its outlook for BMW AG from 'negative' to 'stable' on 26 March 2021. At the same time, the long\u00adterm rating of A2 and the short\u00adterm rating of P\u00ad1 were both confirmed. On 5 August 2021, Standard & Poor's (S&P) adjusted its outlook for BMW AG from 'negative' to 'stable' and confirmed its long\u00adterm and short\u00adterm ratings of A and A\u00ad1 respectively.\n\nIn addition to the general recovery in the automotive indus\u00ad try, the upgraded outlook reflects the rating agencies' expec\u00ad tations that the BMW Group will continue performing well, despite the challenging economic environment. Moreover, both agencies explicitly highlight the fact that BMW AG con\u00ad tinues to implement its policy of decarbonisation, thereby enabling it to undercut the targets set by the EU for 2020.\n\nWith its above\u00adaverage ratings, the BMW Group enjoys good access to international capital markets and is thus able to benefit from highly attractive refinancing conditions.\n\n| Company rating   | Moody's   | Standard   and Poor's   |\n|------------------|-----------|-------------------------|\n| Long\u00adterm debt    | A2        | A                       |\n| Short\u00adterm debt   | P\u00ad1        | A\u00ad1                      |\n| Outlook          | stable    | stable                  |\n\n## GOOD PLACEMENT IN SUSTAINABILITY RATINGS\n\nThe BMW Group has maintained a good ranking in presti\u00ad gious  sustainability  ratings  in  2021.  For  instance,  the BMW Group is represented in the MSCI ESG, Sustainalytics and ISS ESG indexes and is well positioned in its sector in all three. Due to its transparent reporting of carbon emissions, the BMW Group is again in the top grouping (A List) of the CDP rating list.",

This includes:\n\n- - Global competition\n- - Megatrends such as electrification and connectivity\n- - A capital market focused on profitability and growth\n- - Sustainability\n- - Diverging social expectations in the face of climate change\n\nWe constantly refine our corporate strategy and align our strategic targets with these external factors and their dy\u00ad namic rate of change as important input parameters.\n\nThe BMW Group's integrated strategy is based on funda\u00ad mental elements, like the integrity of our actions.\n\n- \u2197 Compliance and Human rights .\n\nThe BMW Group strategy is developed from an analysis of the global megatrends that are crucial to the transformation of the automotive industry and essentially comprises the in\u00ad tegrated and continuous strategy process, the target system and \u2197 Corporate management .\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL   ANALYSIS AND MEGATRENDS\n\nA company's success depends to a large extent on its ability to recognise changes in its environment early on, plan for different scenarios, effectively manage risks and take advan\u00ad tage  of  opportunities  that  may  arise  from  such  changes ( \u2197 Risks and opportunities .) To this end, we continuously monitor the business environment in our key regions, using available data to analyse in detail the trends and developments that could affect our business in the future. Regular \u2197 Dialogue with stakeholders within the framework of the BMW Group Xchange formats rounds out the picture from the analysis of external and environmental factors.\n\nThe most important megatrends with long\u00adterm implications for the BMW Group's business model are currently climate change and the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, electromobility,  digitalisation  and  connectivity  -  including automated and autonomous driving, as well as mobility pat\u00ad terns within society. \u2197 GRI 102\u00ad46\n\n## Mobility patterns\n\nIndividual mobility appears likely to remain a fundamental human  need  for  the  foreseeable  future,  although  vehicle ownership depends to a large extent on income, household size and location (urban/suburban). Mobility services, so\u00ad called  on\u00addemand  mobility  (ODM),  will  remain  relevant,\n\n<!-- image -->",

The assumptions underpinning our strategies are regularly reviewed, based on the findings from our analysis of environmental and external factors. The Board of Manage\u00ad ment sets the strategic direction for this process, regularly addressing strategic issues for the BMW Group and assess\u00ad ing the impact of external factors. The BMW Group's corpo\u00ad rate strategy is the starting point for business departments to systematically align their own strategy with the Company's strategic goals and define the concrete measures that must be implemented in order to achieve them. This process takes place via a planning and management system with a built\u00adin feedback loop.\n\nBMW Group Integrated Strategy\n\nespecially in urban areas, but will mainly be used as a sup\u00ad plementary option \u2197 Mobility concepts and services .\n\nAround the world, the conditions for individual mobility in cities and their surrounding suburban areas are developing very differently in some cases and depend above all on the location of these conurbations, their population density and the focus of emissions policy in the respective urban regions. \u2197 Mobility concepts and services .\n\n## Climate change and CO2 reduction\n\nWe see the consequences of climate change as a major challenge for the future. As governments around the world work to translate the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement into  national  laws,  investors  are  increasingly  evaluating companies and their business models according to ESG cri\u00ad teria \u2197 BMW Group and capital market .\n\nThe European Union (EU) sees itself as a global leader in achieving these climate goals. Within the EU, the Sustain\u00ad able Finance Framework aims to classify a company's busi\u00ad ness activities according to sustainability criteria.\n\nThe US government has also proposed more ambitious cli\u00ad mate\u00adprotection  goals  that  aim  to  halve  greenhouse  gas emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels. China is relying on fleet limits and a growing percentage of zero\u00ademissions vehicles.\n\n## Electromobility and drive technologies\n\nIn the transport sector, a swift transition to electromobility is an important prerequisite on the road to climate neutrality. By 2030, the BMW Group will be capable of offering a com\u00ad plete array of electric vehicles in terms of both product diver\u00ad sity and range.  Growing demand is additionally strength\u00ad ened by the benefits of lower running costs and framework conditions such as government subsidies \u2197 Electromobility .\n\n## Digitalisation and connectivity\n\nIn addition to the topics already referred to, the combination of digitalisation and connectivity is another important mega\u00ad trend for the BMW Group. The modern vehicle is already one of the most complex and software\u00adintensive items owned by consumers. Vehicles are increasingly viewed as digital ob\u00ad jects, with corresponding functions expected. Customers de\u00ad mand products that are seamlessly and perfectly integrated into their familiar living environment. It is therefore safe to assume that digital business models will generate a growing percentage of added value in the future. China, in particular, is setting new standards for digitalisation. Customer desires are increasingly influenced by the world of consumer elec\u00ad tronics and are an important factor in purchasing decisions \u2197 Innovation and customer orientation .\n\nIn addition to the new possibilities digitalisation can offer customers, further potential lies in networking mobile value creation. To create a virtual platform and meet future chal\u00ad lenges, the BMW Group founded the Catena\u00adX Automotive Network, together with other manufacturers, system suppli\u00ad ers and technology partners \u2197 Production, purchasing and supplier network .\n\n## Automated / autonomous driving\n\nAlongside digitalisation, development of automated/autono\u00ad mous driving remains a key expectation for the future of mo\u00ad bility. Due to the importance of this topic for the automotive industry and the complexity of the technologies and exper\u00ad tise involved, extensive funding is being channelled into de\u00ad velopment in this area worldwide.\n\nConcrete requirements and regulations for autonomous driv\u00ad ing are likely to be in place in individual countries and re\u00ad gions by 2025. The aim of all regulators is assumably to au\u00ad thorise autonomous driving systems in the medium term \u2197 Products and mobility solutions .",

Plug\u00adin hybrid (PHEV) concepts also provide a good alternative in these circumstances. \u2197 Products and mobility solutions .\n\nSustainability  is  built  into  individual  market  strategies across our global sales organisation. Centralised measures are combined with local activities in the markets to imple\u00ad ment a holistic programme. Best practices in the fields of environmental  protection,  social  sustainability,  corporate citizenship and governance are also shared within an es\u00ad tablished international sustainability network.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Direction What drives the BMW Group?\n\nDirection is the second strategic element, after position. The BMW Group offers exciting products for current and future generations and secures its independence as a company by maintaining a high level of profitability. The BMW Group is shaping the future of sustainable mobility with its passion and strong capacity for innovation. Thanks to its exciting products, the Company is able to achieve maximum custom\u00ad er satisfaction and brand strength, and thus grow its market share.\n\nBMW Group Integrated Strategy\n\nThe strategy is integrated into annual longer\u00adrange corpor\u00ad ate  planning,  with  implementation  monitored  by  a  target system that is comprised of aspects finance, customers, pro\u00ad cesses, learning and development. \u2197 Performance indicators .\n\n## Corporate strategy\n\nThe  BMW Group's  corporate  strategy,  referred  to  as  the 'BMW Group strategy', forms the core of our integrated ap\u00ad proach. It defines the framework for decision\u00admaking and lays the foundation for the Company to maintain a consistent focus on profitability, growth and sustainability, even in an increas\u00ad ingly dynamic environment.\n\nThe BMW Group strategy comprises four elements: position, di\u00ad rection, strategic approach and collaboration. These formulate the various aspects of our aspirations and are combined in a 'strategy arrow' that serves as a symbol for our forward\u00adlooking approach. This strategic framework provides a fixed point of ref\u00ad erence for all decisions of Company\u00adwide significance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Position What does the BMW Group stand for?\n\nThe BMW Group is committed to first\u00adclass individual mobil\u00ad ity and contributes to sustainable development. It aims to find the right balance between business, the environment and society. The BMW Group combines driving pleasure and responsibility  without  compromise  and,  together  with  its partners, leads the industry in environmental, social and in\u00ad tegrity standards. The Company is committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and providing a verifiable track record of continuous improvement. To achieve this and reduce the im\u00ad pact on the environment as a whole, the BMW Group is pro\u00ad moting as well the reduction of CO 2 emissions throughout the whole product life cycle as the principles of the circular economy - from the supply chain, to production, the use phase  and  the  recycling  of  its  products.  For  this  reason, BMW has also laid out ambitious targets to reduce CO 2 emis\u00ad sions by 2030 (reference year 2019), understood as follows:\n\n- 1.   In the use phase of the vehicle, an average reduction of more than 50 % for every kilometre driven\n- 2.  In production, a reduction of 80 % for every vehicle produced\n- 3.  In the supply chain, a reduction of more than 20 %\n\nMeasurable science\u00adbased targets, initially up until 2030, have been firmly established across the Company, laying the foundation for the reduction of our CO 2 emissions. We have joined the Science\u00adBased Targets Initiative (SBTi) for this purpose. This will enable us to guarantee transparency and comparability in the validation and measurement of our tar\u00ad gets and, at the same time, ensure they are in line with the latest scientific findings \u2197 CO2 and emissions .\n\nControl parameters such as life cycle CO 2 emissions and sec\u00ad ondary  raw  material  quotas  are  already  important  perfor\u00ad mance indicators during the development phase of our vehi\u00ad cle projects \u2197 Performance indicators .\n\nTo leverage the potential for lowering CO 2 emissions during the  use  phase,  in  particular,  the  BMW  Group  is  actively working on numerous projects and initiatives to improve the framework  conditions  for  electromobility.  However,  while the ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement are de\u00ad signed to tackle climate change in the transport sector, they can only be achieved through a combination of all modern drive  technologies  in  addition  to  electromobility  that  are closely aligned with customer needs and different mobility requirements  around  the  world.  Modern  combustion\u00aden\u00ad gine technology continues to make a meaningful contribu\u00ad tion to the effective reduction of CO 2 emissions worldwide. For this reason, the BMW Group offers those customers who choose not to buy an electrified vehicle - because of their mobility needs or because the prerequisites are not met - vehicles with modern, efficient internal combustion engines that rely on technology that is continuously further",

Since 2013, the BMW Group has delivered a total of more than 1 million electrified vehi\u00ad cles to customers. From 2022 onwards, alongside the BMW X3 / iX3, additional models will be available with a choice of fully electric or plug\u00adin hybrid drivetrain, or with a state\u00adof\u00ad the\u00adart internal combustion engine - for example, in the next generation of luxury BMW 7 Series and BMW 5 Series se\u00ad dans and the BMW X1. Going forward, the BMW Group will continue to meet specific customer needs in individual mar\u00ad kets and segments with a broad range of state\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adart drive systems. \u2197 Innovations and customer orientation .\n\nBy 2023, in the middle of the second phase, we will already have at least one fully electric model on the roads in virtually all key model series - from the compact segment to the ultra\u00adluxury class. In this context, we are investing additional funds and plan to increase electrified vehicles' share total deliveries to over 30% by 2025. The trend towards electro\u00ad mobility will also continue to progress dynamically beyond the year 2025. By 2030, the BMW Group plans to increase the share of fully electric automobiles in its total deliveries to more than 50%. \u2197 Performance indicators .\n\nTo make this transformation possible, the BMW Group is pushing ahead, both by restructuring existing plants and by further developing employee competences ( \u2197 Employees  and Society ). The restructuring of BMW Group Plant Munich pro\u00ad vides a clear example of how the BMW Group can success\u00ad fully and smoothly transform a full plant, including produc\u00ad tion of internal combustion engines, to 100% electromobility during ongoing production by 2026. \u2197 Production, Purchasing and Supplier network .\n\nBMW Group Integrated Strategy\n\nThe focus on profitability is a very important aspect of the BMW Group's corporate management system. All measures and  initiatives  are  aimed  at  further  developing  the  BMW Group's strong economic base, so it can continue to operate independently and invest in the future.\n\nTo underline the importance of the BMW Group's economic performance capabilities, our ambitious financial targets are tied to the following strategic key performance indicators: EBIT margin in the Automotive segment (between 8 and 10%), RoCE in the Automotive segment (at least 18%) and Group EBT margin (more than 10%) \u2197 Performance indicators .\n\nAs part of our focus on efficiency, we regularly assess ways to utilise synergies and efficiencies across the Company in an effort to reduce the complexity that arises from increas\u00ad ingly  strict  and  heterogeneous  regulatory  requirements. Faster, digitalised processes within lean structures are fun\u00ad damental to systematically leveraging efficiencies. In vehicle development, for instance, we see considerable potential for reducing process time through digitalisation. In addition to this, distinguishing the BMW Group from its competitors, we are also taking advantage of the expanded possibilities of digitalisation for customer contact, with integrated product and  service  offerings,  functional  upgrades  and  customer support. The BMW Group is also bolstering its portfolio with attractive  new  models  -  especially  in  highly  profitable segments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic approach Where is the BMW Group heading?\n\nThe BMW Group is focused on its customers worldwide and on meeting their different requirements. It does so by un\u00ad derstanding the needs of its current and future customers and  exceeding  their  expectations.  It  combines  ground breaking technologies, emotional products and individual customer care to create a unique overall experience. Creat\u00ad ing the best customer experience, both physically and digi\u00ad tally, as well as personalised, reliable communication, is of primary importance to us.\n\nThe BMW Group is making customer experience the focus of all its marketing and sales activities. The aim is to offer the industry's best premium customer experience and to seam\u00ad lessly integrate all customer touchpoints, online and offline.\n\nThe launch of the My BMW app in July 2020 has given BMW a direct channel to its customers and provided them with a direct link not only to their BMW dealership, but also to the BMW brand as a whole. Customers can use the app to make service appointments, request information on the condition of their vehicle, or receive the latest news on BMW brand products and services. The topic of battery charging has also been fully integrated in this digital ecosystem. The My BMW app  can  also  be  used  to  plan  trips  and  display  suitable charging points along the route. The same applies, of course, to the MINI brand with the MINI app.\n\nWe recognised the importance of electromobility early on and began our transformation in this direction accordingly. In the initial phase, the BMW Group introduced electrification into standard production with the launch of the fully electric BMW i3 in 2013. In 2014, the BMW Group launched the BMW i8, with ground breaking technology and a futuristic design.",

BMW Group employees not only work closely together within the Company, but also with external partners. The stable relationships that have grown over time in our partner networks are based on the same values as those at the BMW Group. This has been especially evident during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. Even when confronted with the challenges of global lockdowns and the shortage of semiconductor components, our supply chains have held up well and our retail network showed its strength. This is the only way we can maximise our effectiveness and, together, lead the Com\u00ad pany to success.\n\nWe are constantly expanding our collaborations to secure access to new technologies and increase value creation setting cooperation goals and defining strategic fields of co\u00ad operation with our partners based on the strategic frame\u00ad work.\n\nBMW Group Integrated Strategy\n\nIn addition to delivering product substance, we also offer our customers a 360\u02da approach to electrification, by creating an appropriate charging ecosystem - because charging is a trailblazer for electromobility. As well as offering charging options at home and at work, we also provide public charg\u00ad ing through BMW Charging and MINI Charging \u2197 Mobility con\u00ad cepts and services .\n\nThe BMW iX is the first BMW Group vehicle to offer automated driving and parking functions from a new technology kit that will enable continuous improvement and expansion of driver assistance functions and highly automated driving in the mid\u00ad term (Level 3). These functions will continue to be rolled out and used in the next\u00adgeneration BMW 7 Series and BMW 5 Series, for instance. Moreover, with the launch of the BMW iX, the BMW Group became the first premium manufacturer to in\u00ad clude the 5G mobile communications standard in a series pro\u00ad duction vehicle on a worldwide basis. In terms of mobility, this means comprehensive expansion of data\u00adbased services in the fields of entertainment and infotainment, automated and assisted driving and, above all, road safety.\n\nThe third phase of the transformation will begin in 2025 with our global fully electric product line\u00adup, the Neue Klasse. Production of vehicles for the Neue Klasse will get underway at the newly constructed BMW Group Plant Debrecen and then expanded to BMW Group Plant Munich from 2026 on\u00ad wards. The Neue Klasse sets the standard for digitalisation, electrification and sustainability. It will be characterised by a New Cluster Architecture (NCAR) geared exclusively towards battery electric vehicles (BEVs), a completely redefined tech stack autonomous driving and a newly developed high\u00adper\u00ad formance  electric  drivetrain  generation.  The  Neue  Klasse also makes a significant contribution to sustainability, by re\u00ad lying on the concept of circularity \u2197 Circular design .\n\nBMW M is also currently working on various forms of electri\u00ad fication and already launched a performance car with a fully electrified drive train, the BMW i4 M50*, in 2021. At the same time, MINI's transition to an all\u00adelectric brand underlines its urban identity. Rolls\u00adRoyce, the world's leading luxury brand, will  also  focus  on  electromobility  in  the  future \u2197 Automotive segment .\n\nBMW Motorrad is continuing to evolve in the direction of electromobility. The 'Vision Amby' Vision Vehicle and the fully\u00adelectric Concept CE 02 provide a glimpse of the future of urban mobility. In the urban mobility segment, the CE 04 electric scooter is a trailblazer for BMW Motorrad's electro\u00ad mobility strategy \u2197 Motorcycles segment .\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the strategic approach is geared towards making the product range available to all customer groups across all channels \u2197 Financial Services segment .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How does the BMW Group ensure cooperation?\n\nOur ambitious strategic objectives can only be achieved if all employees work together.

Capital is considered to be employed profitably when the amount of profit generated on a sustained basis exceeds the cost of equity and debt capital. This strategy also secures the de\u00ad sired degree of corporate autonomy in the long term.\n\nThe  BMW Group's  performance  management  system  is based on a multi layered structure. Operational performance\n\nis managed primarily at segment level. In order to manage long\u00adterm corporate performance and assess strategic is\u00ad sues, additional key performance figures are taken into ac\u00ad count within the management system at Group level. In this context, the value added serves as one of several indicators to measure the contribution made to enterprise value during the financial year. This aspiration to add value is measured at both Group and segment level by means of the key finan\u00ad cial and non\u00adfinancial performance indicators (value drivers). The link between value added and the relevant value drivers is presented in a simplified form below.\n\n## Managing sustainability\n\nThe BMW Group's long\u00adterm corporate strategies are deter\u00ad mined by the Board of Management. Responsibility for im\u00ad plementing  the  Group's  sustainability  goals  therefore  lies\n\n## BMW GROUP - VALUE DRIVERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith the full Board. All topics submitted to the Board of Man\u00ad agement for decision\u00admaking must also be evaluated from the point of view of sustainability, thereby ensuring that sus\u00ad tainability  issues  are  systematically  integrated  in  deci\u00ad sion\u00admaking processes.\n\nAs part of the procedures for managing sustainability on an integrated basis at corporate level, a Group target system has been created, which has been implemented for each of the Board members' areas of responsibility. The BMW Group has set itself the target of decarbonising its vehicle fleet by an average of 40 % overall over the entire life cycle by 2030, based on the reference year 2019. In this context, specific targets have been set for the vehicle's use phase, production and the supply chain ( \u2197 Position ) including emissions reduc\u00ad tion targets across the entire value chain ( \u2197 carbon emissions and pollutants ). Additionally, specific carbon targets have been set for each vehicle project.\n\nAn integrated approach to target management ensures that the BMW Group's vehicle projects make a positive contribu\u00ad tion towards achieving the sustainability targets that have been set. By 2030, the BMW Group intends to drastically broaden the scope of recycling, while further increasing the proportion of secondary raw materials used to manufacture its automobiles. With this point in mind, the BMW Group es\u00ad tablished the so\u00adcalled 'Secondary First' approach during the year under report. Non\u00adfinancial performance indicators such as carbon emissions and secondary raw materials quo\u00ad tas are therefore key performance indicators for all new vehi\u00ad cle projects. The overall result is a cohesive management model across all aspects of the business. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 102\u00ad19",

These value drivers are the number of vehicle deliv\u00ad eries and the operating return on sales (EBIT margin: seg\u00ad ment profit before financial result as a percentage of segment revenues)  as  the  key  performance  indicator  for  segment profitability.\n\nFurthermore, the Automotive segment manages its compli\u00ad ance with fleet carbon emissions requirements in regulated markets. In this context, it also reports on the share of elec\u00ad trified  vehicles  in  total  deliveries \u2197 performance  indicators .  As compliance with regulatory requirements is a significant fac\u00ad tor in the BMW Group's success, business decisions relating to vehicle projects also take targets for fleet carbon emis\u00ad sions into account. \u2197 Managing sustainability\n\nBMW Group Integrated Strategy\n\n## Managing operational performance at segment level\n\nAt segment level, operational performance is managed us\u00ad ing an aggregated approach based on returns on capital. Depending on the business model, the segments are meas\u00ad ured on the basis of return on total capital or return on equity.\n\nReturn on capital employed (RoCE) is used for the Automo\u00ad tive and Motorcycles segments and return on equity (RoE) for the Financial Services segment. These indicators com\u00ad bine a wide range of relevant economic information, such as profitability (return on sales) and capital efficiency (capital turnover) to measure segment performance and the devel\u00ad opment of enterprise value.\n\n## Automotive segment\n\nThe most comprehensive key performance indicator used for the Automotive segment is RoCE, which is measured on the basis of segment profit / loss before financial result and the average capital employed in the segment. It provides infor\u00ad mation on the profitability of capital employed and business operations. Value driver analyses are used to interpret the causes of a change in RoCE and derive suitable measures to influence its development.\n\nUp to and including the reporting year 2021, capital em\u00ad ployed  has  been  defined  as  the  sum  of  all  current  and non\u00adcurrent  operational  assets  less  liabilities  that  were available to the operational business and generally did not incur interest (e. g. trade payables and other provisions).\n\nWith effect from the reporting year 2022, a simplified defi\u00ad nition of capital employed will be applied to make the calcu\u00ad lation of RoCE more comprehensible and transparent. More\u00ad over, the capital employed figures reflect the focus of the operating segment management. In future, capital employed will be calculated as the sum of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and net working capital, the latter com\u00ad prising  inventories  and  trade  receivables  less  trade  pay\u00ad ables. The new definition results in a higher level of capital\n\nemployed  than  previously  reported.  We  also  expect  the amount of capital employed to increase in light of the acqui\u00ad sition of further shares in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. and the resulting full consolidation of that entity in the finan\u00ad cial year 2022, whereby the increase will arise primarily due to the capitalisation of reacquired rights in conjunction with the purchase price allocation. The RoCE will be impacted temporarily by the higher capital base as well as the related amortisation expense expected to be recorded.\n\nThe new strategic target for RoCE is 18 % (target under the previous definition: 40 %). In substance, the new target is even more ambitious than that previously used to measure the  return  on  capital  employed.  Value  is  enhanced  for BMW AG shareholders when the RoCE exceeds the cost of capital.\n\nRoCE Automotive\n\n=\n\n## Profit before financial result\n\nAverage capital employed\n\nDue to the special significance of RoCE for the BMW Group, the Automotive segment is also managed on the basis of a number of additional key performance indicators that have a significant impact on RoCE and hence on segment perfor\u00ad\n\n## RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED (AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT)\n\n|            | Profit before financial result   in   \u20ac million   | Profit before financial result   in   \u20ac million   | Average capital employed  in   \u20ac million   | Average capital employed  in   \u20ac million   |   Return on capital employed   in % |   Return on capital employed   in % |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|            | 2021                                              | 2020                                              | 2021                                       | 2020                                       |                              2021   |                              2020   |\n| Automotive | 9,870                                             | 2,162                                             | 16,486                                     | 17,026                                     |                                59.9 |                                12.7 |",

One of the key perfor\u00ad mance indicators used in this context is Group profit / loss before tax, which provides a comprehensive measure of the Group's overall corporate performance after consolidation effects and enables a transparent comparison over time. Other key performance indicators at Group level are the size of the workforce at the year\u00adend and the share of women in management functions. By 2025, the BMW Group aims to increase the share of women in management functions to 22 %.\n\nThe information provided by these key performance indica\u00ad tors at Group level is complemented by the two financial per\u00ad formance indicators of pre\u00adtax return on sales and value added. Value added, as a highly aggregated performance indicator, also provides an insight into capital efficiency and the (opportunity) cost of capital required to generate Group profit. A positive value added means that a return on invest\u00ad ment above the cost of capital has been achieved.\n\n## Value added Group\n\n- earnings amount cost of capital =\n- earnings amount -\n- (cost of capital rate x capital employed) =\n\nCapital employed comprises the amount of Group equity and pension provisions as well as the financial liabilities of the Automotive and Motorcycles segments employed on aver\u00ad age at the end of each of the last five quarters. The earnings amount corresponds to Group profit / loss before tax, adjust\u00ad ed for interest expense incurred in conjunction with the pen\u00ad sion provision and on the financial liabilities of the Automo\u00ad tive and Motorcycles segments (profit / loss before interest expense and tax). The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return expected by capital providers in return for the capital employed. Since capital employed comprises an equity cap\u00ad ital  (e. g.  share  capital)  and  a  debt  capital  element  (e. g. bonds), the overall cost of capital is determined on the basis of the weighted average rates for equity and debt capital, measured using standard market procedures. The pre\u00adtax average weighted cost of capital for the BMW Group in 2021 was 12 %, unchanged from the previous year.\n\nIn order to determine the internal rate of return, risk\u00adadjusted cost of capital rates are based on the average of actual rates in recent years. In light of the long\u00adterm nature of product and investment decisions, the following internal rates of re\u00ad turn are used in conjunction with segment management:\n\n|   in % |   2021 | 2020               |\n|--------|--------|--------------------|\n|   12   |   12   | Automotive         |\n|   12   |   12   | Motorcycles        |\n|   13.4 |   13.4 | Financial Services |\n\n## VALUE ADDED GROUP\n\n|              | Earnings amount   | Earnings amount   | Cost of capital (equity + debt capital)   | Cost of capital (equity + debt capital)   | Value added Group   | Value added Group   |\n|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| in \u20ac million | 2021              | 2020              | 2021                                      | 2020                                      | 2021                | 2020                |\n| BMW Group    | 16,289            | 5,464             | 8,938                                     | 8,061                                     | 7,351               | - 2,597             |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Value\u00adbased management for project decisions\n\nOperational  business  in  the  Automotive  and  Motorcycles segments  is  largely  shaped  by  the  life\u00adcycle\u00addependent character of investment projects that have a substantial in\u00ad fluence on future performance. Project\u00adrelated decisions are therefore a crucial element of financial management in the BMW Group. Project decisions are based on calculations de\u00ad rived from the expected cash flows of each individual project. Calculations are made for the complete term of a project, in\u00ad corporating future years in which the project is expected to generate cash flows. Project decisions are taken on the ba\u00ad sis of net present value and the internal rate of return calcu\u00ad lated for the project. The net present value indicates the ex\u00ad tent to which the project will be able to generate future net cash inflows over and above the cost of capital. A project with a positive net present value enhances future value add\u00ad ed and therefore results in an increase in enterprise value. The project's internal rate of return measures the average return on the capital employed in the project. For all project decisions, the project criteria and long\u00adterm impact on peri\u00ad odic results are measured and incorporated in the long\u00adterm Group plan. This approach enables an analysis of the impact of project decisions on periodic earnings and rates of return for each year during the term of the project.\n\n## Board of Management remuneration\n\nPerformance criteria for the short\u00ad and long\u00adterm variable remuneration of the Board of Management are also based on the main strategic financial and non\u00adfinancial targets and key performance indicators and contribute towards the BMW Group's  long\u00adterm  development.  Non\u00adfinancial  key performance  indicators  used  in  this  context  include  the number of vehicles delivered, the share of women in man\u00ad agement functions, carbon emissions and sales of electri\u00ad fied  vehicles.  Financial  key  performance  indicators  that have an impact on variable remuneration include the return on capital employed for the Automotive segment as well as other  key  financial  performance  indicators  monitored  at Group level. \u2197 Remuneration Report",

As such, compliance lays the foundation for the long\u00adterm success of the Company, builds trust in our products and brands, and shapes the public image of the BMW Group.\n\n## Compliance as a corporate function\n\nCompliance is the managerial responsibility of the Board of Management of BMW AG and is primarily executed by creat\u00ad ing an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework, as well as through regular and ad hoc compliance reporting, ac\u00ad companied by clear and unambiguous compliance commu\u00ad nications. This approach is based on the core belief that compliance with applicable laws and related internal regula\u00ad tions is the personal responsibility of each individual em\u00ad ployee.  As  role  models,  BMW Group  managers  are  also tasked with anchoring compliance culture in their respective area of responsibility and ensuring compliance requirements and processes are implemented accordingly. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex 102\u00ad16\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Board of Management of BMW AG significantly refined the compliance organisation and created a new Chief Compliance Officer role, which took effect on 1 January 2021 and which serves as head of the Group Compliance. In addition to being responsible for the Compliance Management System (CMS), the Chief Compli\u00ad ance Officer manages the Group Compliance division and briefs the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of BMW AG on development and implementation of the CMS at regular  intervals.  Furthermore,  compliance  has  been  an\u00ad\n\nThe  Supply  Chain  Due  Diligence  Law  will  take  effect  on 1 January 2023 in Germany; the adjustments it requires for the human rights compliance programme have been a key focus for Group Compliance during the reporting period. It should be noted that the Board of Management decided in December 2021  to  appoint  a  Human  Rights  Officer  and assign this role to the head of Group Compliance. Concen\u00ad trating  relevant  expertise  in  this  new  function  will  also contribute to the strategic alignment of the Company in the social dimension of sustainability. Other priorities arose in\n\nchored by the Board of Management in the Company's en\u00ad hanced understanding of leadership.\n\n## Compliance Management System (CMS)\n\nThe BMW Group's Company\u00adwide CMS is based on the Pre\u00ad vent, Detect, Respond Model, which defines specific preven\u00ad tion, monitoring, control and response measures, on the ba\u00ad sis of clearly assigned roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe CMS is tailored to the Company's specific risk situation. It addresses all relevant compliance topics, including fraud prevention, export control, anti\u00admoney laundering, antitrust compliance, corruption prevention and \u2197 human rights as well as \u2197 data privacy and technical compliance . These last two topics are the responsibility of the respective specialist departments. An effective and efficient compliance organisation is funda\u00ad mental to reducing sanction and liability risks, as well as risks arising from other (non\u00ad)financial disadvantages, such as reputational risks.\n\n## Further development of the CMS\n\nDuring the reporting period, the organisation and content of the CMS were refined according to defined strategic focus topics. The objective is to further strengthen the culture of compliance and integrity at the Company, with the declared aim of avoiding Company\u00adrelated violations of the law.\n\nFurther development of the CMS is also taking place against the backdrop of external factors, such as global legal devel\u00ad opments and the evolution of compliance at other compa\u00ad nies. To this end, the BMW Group is involved in various asso\u00ad ciations  and  interest  groups  and  has  been  an  active corporate member of the German Institute for Compliance (DICO) for many years, at the Board level and through its leadership of the working group 'Human Rights / CSR'.\n\n## THREE-STAGE APPROACH TO COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND COMPLIANCE TOPICS\n\n<!-- image -->",

The BMW Group Compliance Contact serves as a fur\u00ad ther point of contact and provides non\u00ademployees with a process for reporting compliance concerns. Our employees worldwide can also submit information relating to possible infringements  of  the  law  at  the  Company  in  several  lan\u00ad guages  via  the  BMW Group  SpeakUP  Line.  In  2021,  an ombuds person  for  suppliers  was  dedicated. \u2197 Verification  of effectiveness\n\nThe BMW Group protects information providers in two ways. If they prefer, individuals may provide information without disclosing their identity. Policy also stipulates that no one providing information should face retaliatory action. All com\u00ad pliance\u00adrelated queries and concerns are documented and processed using an electronic Case Management System. If necessary, Corporate Audit, Corporate Security, the legal de\u00ad partments or the Works Council may be called upon to assist in processing the case. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 102\u00ad34\n\n## CMS monitoring / controls\n\nObservance and implementation of compliance regulations and processes are subject to regular audits. The BMW Group CMS provides differentiated monitoring levels for this pur\u00ad pose. Compliance Officers are those primarily responsible for performing direct checks in their area of responsibility. Further measures integrated into business processes to help reduce risk generally form part of the \u2197 Internal Control System . The central Group Compliance function refined its audit ap\u00ad proach in 2021, with the aim of increasing audit frequency by introducing  risk\u00adbased  compliance  audits  without  cause. These compliance audits are currently focused on antitrust\n\nBMW Group Integrated Strategy\n\nthe context of export controls from heightened trade rela\u00ad tions between the US and China and in connection with efforts to prevent money laundering, due in part to the in\u00ad crease  in  legislative  initiatives  to  tighten  multinational anti\u00admoney\u00adlaundering  requirements.\n\nA further priority was developing and implementing more ex\u00ad tensive  preventive  measures  in  response  to  the  antitrust proceedings brought by the European Commission and con\u00ad cluded in July 2021, concerning restriction of competition in innovation in certain emissions control systems 1 .\n\n## \u2197 Note 10 to the Group Financial Statements \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 205\u00ad3\n\nIncreasingly  strict  national  legislation  to  protect  personal data, and the higher risks associated with this, shaped com\u00ad pliance measures regarding data privacy.\n\nIn response to the rapid pace of transformation in the auto\u00ad motive industry, activities in the field of technical compliance were also significantly expanded during the period under report.\n\n## Company\u00adwide compliance network\n\nBusiness departments at the BMW Group are responsible for lawful conduct during the performance of their assigned tasks. This means they are also responsible for identifying and evaluating any compliance risks that arise in the course of their daily business. Monitoring and reducing these risks also falls under their scope of duties. More than 230 man\u00ad agers group\u00adwide perform these tasks. These Compliance Officers form part of the Compliance Organisation.\n\nSpecialist departments are supported in their work by the central Group Compliance function, as well as a Group\u00adwide network of business unit and division compliance functions, supplemented  by  around  80  local  Compliance  Officers (heads of local compliance functions) at BMW AG's inter\u00ad national subsidiaries. Local Compliance Officers are tasked with implementing the CMS and compliance programmes for\n\nrelevant topics within their area of responsibility. Business unit and division compliance functions also perform the task of identifying and implementing specific compliance meas\u00ad ures in their area of activity.\n\n## Expanded training activities\n\nThe BMW Group continuously refines the Group Compliance training opportunities for specific target groups. For exam\u00ad ple, during the year under review, we redesigned our Group\u00ad wide  mandatory  Compliance  Essentials  online  training  to create a user\u00adoriented approach with focused content and a high level of interactivity. This training formed part of the mandatory training programme and included human rights topics in the year under report. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 412\u00ad2\n\nIn addition to imparting knowledge, online and classroom training options, including practical case studies, play an im\u00ad portant part in strengthening the compliance culture and un\u00ad derstanding of compliant behaviour at the Company. Online training must be completed every two years by relevant tar\u00ad get groups. The training modules include exercises and test questions  relating  to  the  BMW Group  Legal  Compliance Code and corruption prevention, as well as other topics. So far,  more  than  69,000  employees  worldwide  have  com\u00ad pleted the Compliance Essentials training, and over 36,000 employees completed online antitrust compliance training. Department\u00adspecific training modules supplement the ex\u00ad tensive options - for instance, in the areas of antitrust law or \u2197 human rights . \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 205\u00ad1\n\n## Digitalisation supports compliance\n\nBMW Group  employees  have  used  IT\u00adbased  systems  for swift and efficient documentation, assessment and approval of compliance\u00adrelevant matters for years. Examples include IT\u00adsupported processes to monitor money laundering, sanc\u00ad tion lists and exchange activities with competitors as well as to conduct background checks on the reliability of business partners and verify, approve and document the legal admis\u00ad sibility  of  benefits  in  kind.

        "page_content": "## Compliance management in the Financial Services segment\n\nThe financial services business entails specific risks, due to the nature of its products and processes. The focus of com\u00ad pliance  management  is  therefore  anti\u00admoney\u00adlaundering, compliance with financial sanctions, information and privacy protection, fraud prevention, legislative and regulatory moni\u00ad toring, consumer protection and implementing the require\u00ad ments of the Financial Supervisory Authorities. To manage risk  in  these  areas,  the  Financial  Services  segment  has established  its  own  Compliance  and  Governance  depart\u00ad ment, which works closely with the central Group Compli\u00ad ance function as a decentralised unit. Based on an annual trend analysis it identifies the possible need for adjustments and  defines  resulting  measures.  Implementation  by  the BMW Group's  financial  services  companies  worldwide  is continuously reviewed and reported to the management of the Financial Services segment on a quarterly basis.\n\nIn  the  BMW Group's  Financial  Services  segment,  compli\u00ad ance is incorporated into the target management process. Integration of specific targets into strategic steering under\u00ad lines the importance of this topic and helps to monitor the implementation. A management system also supports the process of identifying risks arising from non\u00adcompliance with internal and external regulations at an early stage.\n\nBMW Group Integrated Strategy\n\nlaw. So\u00adcalled Compliance Spot Checks were also carried out in 2021, with a focus on possible corruption risks. Cor\u00ad porate Audit also conducts audits focused on compliance requirements.\n\nAll control checks are geared towards reducing compliance risks for the BMW Group. Any infringements are immediately remedied, with an emphasis on minimising the risk of repeat offenses and strengthening the understanding of compli\u00ad ance within the Company. Where incidences of non\u00adcompli\u00ad ance can be traced to an individual, such persons will be appropriately sanctioned, in accordance with the processes defined for this purpose.\n\n## Regular compliance reporting to the Board of Management and Supervisory  Board\n\nThe  Board  of  Management  and  Supervisory  Board  of BMW AG, the Audit Committee and other executive commit\u00ad tees are informed on a regular basis and, if necessary, im\u00ad mediately by the Chief Compliance Officer. In 2021, the con\u00ad tent reported to committees was focused and the frequency of reports increased - for example, at least twice a year for the Board of Management.\n\n## Global implementation of labour standards and human rights\n\nInternationally recognised guidelines for environmental and social compliance set the benchmark for the BMW Group's entire value chain. This applies, in particular, to the Guide\u00ad lines for Multinational Companies issued by the Organisa\u00ad tion for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, the content of the ICC Business Charter for Sustainable Development, and the United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP) Dec\u00ad laration  on  Cleaner  Production.  The  BMW Group  concen\u00ad trates on topics and action areas where it can exert its influ\u00ad ence  as  a  company.  With  the  participation  of  employee representatives,  these  (supra)national  requirements  were incorporated  into  internal  company  rules  and  principles through the \u2197 Joint Declaration on Human Rights and Working Conditions in the  BMW Group of  2005  (updated  in  2010),  clarified  in  the \u2197 BMW Group Code on Human Rights and Working Conditions of 2018 and integrated with the human rights compliance programme.\n\nThe automotive industry is heavily involved in global supply chains. In a collaborative global value creation process such as this, there is a risk that human rights may not be respect\u00ad ed throughout the supply chain. Respect for human rights has been incorporated into the \u2197 BMW Group Supplier Sustainability Policy . To fulfil our \u2197 environmental and social responsibility , we imple\u00ad ment a multistage due diligence process in our Purchasing and Supplier Network division.\n\nIn addition to the Company's international purchasing terms and conditions, BMW Group dealer and importer contracts include  requirements  relating  to  compliance  and  human rights. Human rights issues also play an important role in the Company's choice of locations and major investment decisions. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 412\u00ad3",

During the year under report, innovations again led to processes being optimised, products improved, and new technologies introduced that make everyday life easier for our customers. We see the future as electric, digital and circular.\n\n## Circular design - a topic shaping the future\n\nThe  BMW Group  and  its  brands  are  well\u00adknown  for  their emotive, forward\u00adthinking design. In the course of the re\u00ad porting year we also focused on another key facet of our work: circular design. At the IAA Mobility in September 2021, design geared to promoting sustainability and driven by the circular economy concept \u2197 Circularity as a Strategic priority found its expression in the \u2197 BMW i Vision Circular . The design of this vision vehicle has been optimised for closed material loops and shows what a vehicle can look like that is not only made of 100 % recycled materials, but is, in fact, itself fully recyclable.\n\nEfficient urban mobility is another strategic focus reflected in the vision and concept vehicles that the BMW Group pre\u00ad sented in 2021. The Group also demonstrated its ability to develop innovative solutions with design studies such as the \u2197 BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY and the \u2197 BMW i Vision AMBY two\u00adwheel\u00ad ers. Powered by smart speed and drive system controls, they can be used both on the road and on cycle paths.

For example, in many markets vehicles can be demonstrated live on a screen shared with a customer or configured online to\u00ad gether with a member of our sales team. A complete online sales process has already been successfully implemented in some of our markets, with others to follow in the foreseeable future.\n\nFurthermore, digitalisation is a vital key to keeping our ve\u00ad hicles  'fresh'  throughout  their  entire  life  cycle.  Since  the launch of Operating System 7 in 2018, remote software up\u00ad grades have become a reality for BMW automobiles.\n\nRemote software upgrades also provide BMW owners with the option to tap into new digital business models such as 'functions  on  demand'.  Customers  can  either  purchase additional  functions  or  simply  order  them  for  a  specific amount of time. The response to these offers has already been highly positive. \u2197 Online Report\n\nIn autumn 2021, with the launch of the new, all\u00adelectric BMW iX, the BMW Group simultaneously introduced its new BMW Operating System 8 as well as a new display and control system.  The  principal  design  focus  was  on  clarity  and straightforward,  intuitive  usability.  The  large  BMW  curved display enables drivers to customise the content of their dis\u00ad play via a touchscreen. Buttons and switches have been re\u00ad duced to a necessary minimum.\n\nDigitalisation also enables innovations, simplifications and advances outside the vehicle. The My BMW app and the MINI app for smartphones have been available since 2020. They provide a connection from wherever the user is located to the vehicle - or to the service partner if required. Both apps were equipped with additional new features during the\n\nperiod under report. For example, the My BMW app now also includes a digital tyre diagnosis feature that uses artificial intelligence to assess the condition of the vehicle's tyres. The MINI app now enables users to access a broader range of services, including booking appointments and paying for services  contactlessly.  In  an  optionally  available  service video, they can find out about the vehicle check or opt for a variety of services. Innovative digital solutions are also de\u00ad ployed  in  other  areas  of  the  BMW Group,  such  as  in production  or  development  scenarios.  When  it  comes  to maintaining production systems, we are switching to what is known as a predictive maintenance strategy. With the help of sensors,  cloud\u00adbased  data  analysis  and  artificial  intelli\u00ad gence,  the  system  assesses  when  a  particular  piece  of equipment needs to be serviced in order to prevent unneces\u00ad sary production downtime. The technology allows mainten\u00ad ance to be planned and components to be replaced before they actually break down.\n\n## REMOTE SOFTWARE UPGRADES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Drive technologies of the future\n\nThe BMW Group also focuses on the needs and wishes of its customers worldwide when developing its drive technolo\u00ad gies. For this reason, we are constantly enhancing our exist\u00ad ing drive technologies in the interests of efficiency, decar\u00ad bonisation and resource conservation. At the same time, of course, the BMW Group is researching new drive technolo\u00ad gies with the aim of preparing them for series production.\n\nSome 30 BMW models are currently upgradeable, which means that suitable vehicles can receive the latest software upgrades ' over the air ' . These remote software upgrades provide BMW vehicles with improvements as well as new digital products and services and keep the software up to date.\n\nThe BMW Group has already offered automated remote soft\u00ad ware upgrades to more than four million of its vehicles, and cus\u00ad tomers have successfully installed them more than 2.3 million times.

In the first phase, the Group began pioneering e\u00admobility as early as 2007 with project i, enhancing the technology and then developing electrified vehicles for series production. In the second phase, which is currently underway, we are intro\u00ad ducing  electrification  to  the  product  portfolio  with  a  new model initiative \u2197 Broader offering based on smart vehicle archi\u00ad tectures and our highly flexible \u2197 production  network , which is capable  of  manufacturing  the  full  range  of  vehicles  from all\u00adelectric to combustion engine drive systems on the same production line. By the peak of the second transformation phase at the end of 2025, the share of electrified cars in the BMW Group's total deliveries is scheduled to rise to at least 30 %.\n\nFrom 2025, the third phase will begin with the Neue Klasse, which will be characterised by three key aspects: a com\u00ad pletely redefined IT and software architecture, a new genera\u00ad tion of electric drive systems and batteries, and a new level of sustainability across the entire vehicle life cycle. Contributing factors  include:\n\n- - the all\u00adelectric drive system\n- - the use of carbon\u00adfree energy in ever larger parts of the supply chain\n- - the increasing use of secondary materials\n- - closed\u00adloop systems for essential production materials\n\nThis high technological standard will be integrated in a com\u00ad plete vehicle architecture exclusively geared towards electric drive systems.\n\nPowerful, sustainable energy storage systems and the de\u00ad velopment of new, innovative battery cells are key elements for powering future generations of all\u00adelectric vehicles. For the Neue Klasse, we are working on significantly increasing the energy density of the cells, while at the same time cutting material and production costs. Battery recyclability is an\u00ad other key consideration that will impact the development of all  our  future  generations  of  battery  cells.  Moreover,  the BMW Group is already conducting intensive research into solid\u00adstate battery technology, which shows great promise for the future.\n\n## Hydrogen fuel cell technology\n\nDuring the year under report we began testing the BMW iX5 Hydrogen with its hydrogen fuel cell drive in everyday driving scenarios in Europe. The aim is to test the interaction be\u00ad\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntween the carbon\u00adfree drive system, the chassis technology and the electronic systems under realistic conditions. The BMW iX5 Hydrogen uses hydrogen as a fuel and converts it into electricity via a fuel cell, making the BMW iX5 Hydrogen a fully electrically powered vehicle. A pilot series of this mod\u00ad el will be produced at the end of 2022 in order to gain further practical experience in a broadly based field trial.\n\nHydrogen fuel cell technology has the potential to become a sustainable alternative to battery electric drive systems. The technology really comes into its own when comprehensive electric charging infrastructure is not available and there are also a broad number of applications for this technology on long\u00addistance journeys or in larger classes of vehicle. De\u00ad pending on market requirements and other general condi\u00ad tions, the BMW Group intends to offer a production vehicle of this type in the second half of the decade.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The move was followed in November 2021 by an agreement with RWTH Aachen University also aimed at supporting research into quantum computing. Both of these collaborations are intended to build a bridge between basic research and industrial application.\n\nIn July 2021, the BMW Group launched the BMW Group Quantum Com\u00ad puting  Challenge crowd  innovation  initiative  in  collaboration  with Amazon  Web  Services  Inc.  Researchers,  start\u00adups  and  companies alike are called upon to develop innovative quantum algorithms that serve as solutions to one of four industrial challenges that were an\u00ad nounced. The winners will be invited to implement the selected pilot projects together with the BMW Group as their customer.\n\nfocuses on life in the city, and the \u2197 BMW Startup Garage , which represents the third and final pillar. In May, the BMW Group opened a so\u00adcalled 'incubation site' in Shanghai in cooper\u00ad ation with Alibaba Cloud. This joint innovation base aims to help Chinese tech start\u00adups scale their innovations.\n\n## Cooperations and partnerships\n\nIn order to maintain its long\u00adterm success, the BMW Group enters into targeted cooperations and partnerships, not only with companies from the automotive industry, but with tech\u00ad nology leaders from other sectors as well. The aim of co\u00ad operating with external partners is to pool our common ex\u00ad pertise and implement innovations as swiftly as possible. Some of the BMW Group's major collaborations and invest\u00ad ments are listed below:\n\nProducts and Mobility Solutions\n\nThe BMW iX5 Hydrogen is powered by fuel cells that stem from the Group's development cooperation with the Toyota Motor Corporation. However, the fuel cell stack and the over\u00ad all  drive  system  are  being  developed  in\u00adhouse  by  the BMW Group. The collaborative project, which began in 2013, aims to optimise the everyday suitability of fuel cell technol\u00ad ogy and its use in each company's own production vehicles.\n\nIn order to build up an efficient hydrogen\u00adbased economy and  promote  the  production  of  green \u2197 Hydrogen , the BMW Group supports initiatives right across Europe.\n\n## Inspiration and cooperation\n\nGood ideas often come into being when different partners decide to work together. Accordingly, we focus on cooper\u00ad ations in which the strengths of the BMW Group comple\u00ad ment those of established partners and innovation drivers such as start\u00adups. Using this approach, we are constantly developing the innovative strength of the BMW Group.\n\nRegional BMW Group Technology Offices are in search of promising business partners worldwide in fields of innova\u00ad tion such as sensor technology, artificial intelligence, bat\u00ad tery  technology,  smart  materials,  natural  user  interfaces and  smart  logistics.  To  maintain  this  network,  the BMW Group also holds an intensive dialogue with selected colleges and universities. For example, numerous Group employees also lecture at universities and higher education institutions  and  a  great  many  students  come  to  the BMW Group each year to complete an internship or write a scientific  thesis,  enabling  us  to  ensure  the  transfer  of knowledge  between  theory  and  practice  and  help  train highly qualified junior staff.\n\n## QUANTUM COMPUTING\n\nThe BMW Group clearly sees quantum computing as a groundbreak\u00ad ing technology of the future that has considerable potential for use in a broad range of applications, such as for researching materials, in the field of battery cell chemistry, or to power the future of automated driving with quantum machine learning. However, it is still a long way from achieving technological maturity and that's why it is particularly important for us to provide the best possible support for cutting\u00adedge research and its transfer to industrial applications.\n\nThe BMW Group is one of ten German companies that formed the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC) in June 2021. The aim of the consortium is to continue developing the existing fundamentals of quantum computing to create truly usable industrial applications.\n\n## Worldwide culture of innovation\n\nThe  Munich  Research  and  Innovation  Centre  (FIZ)  is  the main hub of the BMW Group's international network of re\u00ad search and development locations. After the initial construc\u00ad tion phase, the extension was first occupied in autumn 2020, the new driving simulation centre was also put into oper\u00ad ation during the year under report. In five of a total of 14 sim\u00ad ulators and usability labs, LED walls are deployed to create a virtual environment for development purposes, to enable more  realistic  representations  than  previous  projection systems.\n\nThe  global  dialogue  with  start\u00adups  is  another  important means for us to bring new impulses into the Company. The dialogue is based on three key pillars: \u2197 BMW i Ventures through which  we  invest  in  technology  start\u00adups,  the \u2197 Accelerator URBAN\u00adX start\u00adup, which was initiated by the MINI brand and",

(BBA)  is  a  joint  venture founded in 2003 and owned equally by the BMW Group and Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (CBA). BMW Bril\u00ad liance Automotive manufactures BMW brand models at an engine plant and two automobile plants in Shenyang, China (Liaoning Province). In February 2022, the BMW Group ac\u00ad quired a further 25 % of the shares in the BMW Brilliance joint  venture.  Further  information  on  the  consolidation  of BMW Brilliance Automotive is available in the Notes to the Group \u2197 Notes to the Financial Statement .\n\nSpotlight Automotive Limited (Spotlight), a joint venture be\u00ad tween the BMW Group and the Chinese manufacturer Great Wall Motors, will produce all\u00adelectric MINIs as well as electric vehicles  for  Great  Wall  Motors.  Established  in  December 2019, the joint venture also includes the collaborative devel\u00ad opment of battery electric vehicles. The construction of a production  plant  in  Zhangjiagang  (Jiangsu  Province)  is meanwhile in the advanced stages. With this collabor ation, the BMW Group is stepping up its commitment in  China and significantly increasing its production capacities.\n\nSince the BMW Group, Daimler and Audi acquired the HERE mapping service in 2015, the three partners have been work\u00ad ing on developing high\u00adprecision digital maps that can be linked to real\u00adtime vehicle data. The maps form the basis for the  next  generation  of  location\u00adrelated  services,  thereby marking another key step in the evolution of individual mobil\u00ad ity as well as building a solid foundation for developing new assistance systems. HERE remains accessible as an inde\u00ad pendent platform for the automotive industry as well as for other partners. During the year under report, the location data and technology platform had nine direct and indirect shareholders, i. e. Audi, Bosch, the BMW Group, Continental, Intel, Mitsubishi, Daimler, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, and Pioneer.\n\nThe BMW Group is a founding partner of the IONITY joint venture, the aim of which is to establish a high\u00adperformance, high\u00adpower  charging  network  for  electric  vehicles  right across Europe. The joint venture represents a vital step to\u00ad wards ensuring that electric mobility also becomes a con\u00ad venient means of transport for long\u00addistance travel, thus es\u00ad tablishing it firmly on the market. The founding partners, i. e. the BMW Group, Daimler AG, the Ford Motor Company and the Volkswagen Group together with Audi and Porsche, all participated in equal measure. In 2019, the Hyundai Motor Group with its Hyundai and Kia brands joined as an addi\u00ad tional partner. In the year under report, the existing partners signed the inclusion of Blackrock as a further investor (clos\u00ad ing after approval through anti\u00adtrust authorities). The move will enable IONITY to further invest in consolidating and ex\u00ad panding the fast charging network. \u2197 Expanding charging infra\u00ad structure and enabling faster charging\n\nUnder the brand name YOUR NOW, the BMW Group and Daimler Mobility AG offer innovative, customer\u00adfriendly solu\u00ad tions for business partners, cities, towns and municipalities that are looking to make their mobility more efficient and sustainable.  The  cooperation  includes  the  joint  ventures FREE NOW (ride\u00adsharing and multimodality), REACH NOW (on\u00addemand  mobility  and  multimodality),  SHARE  NOW (car sharing) and CHARGE NOW (charging). In 2021, the en\u00ad ergy company bp also joined to become the third partner in Digital Charging Solutions GmbH (DCS), which operates the CHARGE NOW brand. \u2197 Innovative mobility services on offer\n\nIn 2021, the BMW Group, together with the Ford Motor Com\u00ad pany, Volta Energy Technologies and other investors, invest\u00ad ed in Solid Power, Inc., one of the industry's leading develop\u00ad ers of solid\u00adstate battery cells with high energy density that can also be used to power electric vehicles.

Thus we again significantly raised the original tar\u00ad get of more than 40 % that we had set ourselves. The main reason for this is the dynamic growth in demand for our electrified vehicles. \u2197 Electric mobility , \u2197 Automotive segment The adjusted target of 50 % has been submitted and successfully validated by SBTi in february 2022.\n\nProducts and Mobility Solutions\n\n## CARBON EMISSIONS AND POLLUTANTS\n\nMitigating the impact of climate change is one of the great\u00ad est challenges of our time and requires a massive effort, not only on the part of society as a whole, but also from policy\u00ad makers and the business community. The BMW Group is also involved in these endeavours. By 2050, we intend to achieve  the  target  of  net  zero  in  terms  of  our  emissions across the entire value chain. With this aim in mind, in 2020 the BMW Group set itself ambitious, science\u00adbased targets for the year 2030, which have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We intend to achieve these targets by further reducing the carbon footprint and pollutant emissions of our vehicles, as we have done in the past.\n\n## Decarbonising across the entire life cycle\n\nThe BMW Group is pursuing a clear strategy of decarbonisa\u00ad tion across the entire life cycle of its vehicles and has defined specific targets in order to do so. With this holistic approach, we are moving forward on a path in line with the climate pro\u00ad tection targets designed to limit global warming enshrined in the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\n## Holistic management system\n\n- - The BMW Group intends to leverage its holistic manage\u00ad ment system to substantially improve its carbon footprint from one vehicle generation to the next across the entire life cycle. In view of the increasing electrification, it is par\u00ad ticularly important to be aware that although the trend reduces carbon emissions during the \u2197 use phase . It in\u00ad creases them at the same time in the supply chain. The reason for this lies primarily in the carbon\u00adintensive com\u00ad ponents  needed  to  power  electric  mobility,  such  as high\u00advoltage  batteries  in  particular.  With  this  point  in mind,  the  BMW Group  defines  specific \u2197 decarbonisation targets for all its vehicles right from the outset. The targets\n\nencompass the supply chain, production and the subse\u00ad quent use of the vehicle by the customer. Our system for \u2197 measuring performance enables us to ensure that these tar\u00ad gets are implemented both rigorously and consistently throughout the entire Group. The strategy allows us to take our decarbonisation targets into account right from the product development stage as well as market\u00adrelated requirements for our vehicle fleet at the same time. We manage the implementation of our targets and the as\u00ad sessment of progress during the development process with the help of a carbon footprint based on ISO stand\u00ad ards 14040 and 14044.\n\n## Decarbonisation targets across the value chain\n\nMeasurable, science\u00adbased targets that initially extend to 2030 form the basis for our decarbonisation strategy and for this  reason  we  have  joined  the  SBTi.  The  use  of  sci\u00ad ence\u00adbased targets makes the measurability of our targets transparent and at the same time ensures that they are in line with the latest scientific findings.\n\nWe have set ourselves the following decarbonisation targets 1 to be achieved by 2030 (base year 2019). These targets were notified to the SBTi and validated in 2020.\n\n- - An average of 80 % carbon reduction at our own produc\u00ad tion sites and locations (Scope 1 and 2) per vehicle pro\u00ad duced. \u2197 Decarbonisation  at  BMW Group  locations From  2021, carbon emissions in accordance with Scope 1 and 2 include not  only  production\u00adspecific  emissions,  but  also  those generated at locations not directly related to production. 6\n- - An average of at least 20 % 2 carbon reduction in the sup\u00ad ply chain (Scope 3 upstream 3 ) per vehicle produced. This data also provides us with a scientifically tested and con\u00ad firmed target for reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain. \u2197 Reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain",

We are demonstrating this commitment with our me\u00ad dium\u00ad and long\u00adterm plans for decarbonisation. To emphasise our intention, during the year under report we became the first German automotive manufacturer to join the \u2197 Business Ambi\u00ad tion for 1.5\u00b0C initiative of the SBTi. The campaign brings together companies that have set themselves the target of net zero emis\u00ad sions in line with the SBTi and are thus following a long\u00adterm 1.5 degree pathway. By joining the initiative, the BMW Group is also part of the international \u2197 Race to Zero campaign organised by the United Nations. With this move, we also want to motivate other companies to take ambitious steps to protect the climate.\n\nProducts and Mobility Solutions\n\nWith  the  even  more  ambitious  target  of  reducing  carbon emissions during the use phase by more than 50 %, the overall view over the complete life cycle 1 of a vehicle by 2030 results in an average carbon emissions reduction of at least 40 %. By 2050, we intend to achieve net zero in terms of our carbon emissions across the entire value chain.

Nonetheless, carbon emissions are 8 % down overall compared to the base year 2019, mainly due to lower average fleet emissions worldwide.\n\n## Decarbonisation during the use phase meets legal requirements\n\nThe carbon emissions generated during the use phase are the subject of numerous regulatory requirements and also a key parameter in our life cycle assessment. With the early serial introduction of \u2197 electrified vehicles since 2013 and the fleet\u00adwide use of innovative \u2197 Efficient Dynamics technologies since 2007, we have continuously and permanently reduced both vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. These two param\u00ad eters form the basis for us for again meeting mandatory car\u00ad bon emissions and fuel consumption requirements in the year under report. \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex\n\n## EU carbon emissions targets achieved\n\nAs from 2021, average fleet CO 2 emissions in the EU 4 must be reported according to the new WLTP 5 type test cycle. In the year under report they totalled 115.9 g CO 2 / km 6 , taking regulatory requirements into account. We have thus signifi\u00ad cantly reduced fleet carbon emissions compared with the previous year (2020: 135 g CO 2 / km 6, 7 ). We were significantly below  the  limit  of  125.8 g CO 2 / km applicable  for  the BMW Group  by  9.9 g CO 2 / km. The reduction is therefore in line with the trend seen in previous decades, driven by the increasing electrification of our vehicle fleet and continuous improvements in the efficiency of our internal combustion engines. On this basis, we continue to work unabated to fur\u00ad ther reduce greenhouse gas emissions going forward. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 305\u00ad5",

Volume\u00adweighted fleet carbon emissions in the USA averaged 140.9 g CO 2 / km  (MY 2020:  166.8 g CO 2 / km)  (BMW  internal  calculation).  In  the 2021 reporting year, legally permissible imputation factors 1 were included for the first time. For this reason, direct com\u00ad parability with the previous year is not possible. In China, av\u00ad erage fleet carbon emissions 2 were  163.0 g CO 2 / km  accord\u00ad ing to the new WLTC test cycle introduced in the year under report  (2020:  151.1 g CO 2 / km  NEDC).  Due  to  the  change of cycle, a direct comparison with the previous year is not possible.\n\nThe BMW Group's global carbon fleet emissions 3 averaged 197.9 g  CO 2 / km 3 in  the  year  under  report  (2020:  212.4 g CO 2 / km). The figure represents a reduction of 9.4 % com\u00ad pared with the 2019 baseline. When calculating these emis\u00ad sions, the BMW Group takes into account the average fleet carbon emissions in the EU, the USA and China and stand\u00ad ardises them according to WLTP. Accounting for more than 80 % of BMW Group deliveries overall, these three core mar\u00ad kets and regions are a reliable basis for calculating fleet car\u00ad bon emissions worldwide. In line with the SBTi, we add 10 % to the figures calculated to cover any possible differences between the figures according to WLTP and actual emis\u00ad sions. The figure also includes the upstream supply chain emissions  generated  by  energy  sources  (fossil  fuels  and electricity) in accordance with the well\u00adto\u00adwheel approach. 4 \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 305\u00ad5\n\nThe BMW Group has the clear ambition not only to comply with statutory carbon emissions limits worldwide, but also to  significantly  undercut  them  wherever  possible.  At  the same time, we support the development of harmonised reg\u00ad ulations - both nationally and internationally. Comparable regulations  in  major  markets  create  reliable,  predictable framework conditions that make a key contribution to com\u00ad batting climate change and improving air quality. We ad\u00ad dress the opportunities and risks associated with increas\u00ad ingly  strict  carbon  emissions  regulations  as  part  of  our \u2197 climate\u00adrelated risks . \u2197 TCFD\u00adIndex\n\nThe BMW Group supports the proposal published by the EU Commission in the year under report for implementing the EU's 2030 climate protection target. The associated goals of Fit for 55 largely coincide with those of the BMW Group.\n\nMoreover,  we  are  closely  monitoring  regulatory  develop\u00ad ments in the USA. In 2020, the BMW Group entered into a voluntary agreement with the US state of California to reduce its fleet emissions. The bilateral agreement is applicable for all new BMW Group vehicle registrations in every state of the USA. In 2021, the US government announced plans to intro\u00ad duce tougher fleet fuel consumption targets at national level. The BMW Group also intends to comply with these future requirements. The US federal requirements regarding Green\u00ad house Gas Emissions (GHG) generated by vehicle fleets and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations are applicable in this case.\n\n## Designing conventional drive systems for greater efficiency and lower emissions\n\nThe  BMW Group  expects  state\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adart,  highly  efficient combustion engines to continue playing a vital role. As part of our Efficient Dynamics approach, we will therefore con\u00ad tinue to work on further reducing the fuel consumption of conventional drive systems in the coming years, thereby in\u00ad creasing their efficiency. \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Technological improvements\n\nThe BMW Group has been implementing its Efficient Dy\u00ad namics package of technological measures across its entire fleet since 2007. The package comprises a range of coordi\u00ad nated measures designed to reduce fuel consumption. We will  continue  to  pursue  this  strategy  with  innovative  ap\u00ad proaches to the use of internal combustion engines, aerody\u00ad namics and lightweight construction. The broader use of 48\u00ad volt technology is a key component in this regard. 48\u00advolt recuperation systems gather the energy recovered during braking to supply the vehicle's electrical system and gener\u00ad ate additional power, which reduces fuel consumption and therefore  carbon  emissions.  In  the  EU,  apart  from  our all\u00adelectric and plug\u00adin hybrid models, we are also offering a wide range of new models featuring a 48\u00advolt recuperation system. As from 2022, our modular motors will be fitted with the second, even more efficient generation of 48\u00advolt tech\u00ad nology. The continued further development of energy man\u00ad agement technologies in our vehicles, supplemented by oth\u00ad er  measures  such  as  switching  to  highly  efficient  tyres, should ensure even greater efficiency and optimise fuel con\u00ad sumption.",

Be\u00ad tween 1992 and 2021, in Europe alone we reduced the rele\u00ad vant exhaust emissions of our new fleet of diesel cars in line with Euro 1 to Euro 6d exhaust standards by more than 90 % compared to the level recorded prior to their introduction. Measures aimed at minimising air pollution have made a significant contribution to these achievements. All BMW Group vehicles offered for sale during the year under report meet the current Euro 6d emissions standard in the European Union as well as similar regulations in Switzer\u00ad land, Norway, the United Kingdom and Iceland.\n\nNitrogen oxide levels are a crucial factor determining the quality of air in towns and cities. With this point in mind, since mid\u00ad2018 the BMW Group has been using a highly ef\u00ad fective  combination  of  a  NOx  storage  catalytic  converter (NSC) and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system with urea injection (AdBlue) in all diesel\u00adpowered BMW vehicles as well as in the larger MINI diesel models. The efficiency of exhaust gas after\u00adtreatment has been additionally boosted by the use of an improved oxidation catalytic converter com\u00ad bined with a two\u00adstage SCR system. The new technology has been available since 2020 with the revised generation of six\u00adcylinder diesel engines and is due to be rolled out across the  entire  product  range  during  the  coming  years.  There have already been noticeable reductions in NOx pollution levels in German cities over the past few years, partially driv\u00ad en by the ongoing renewal of the vehicle fleets of all automo\u00ad tive manufacturers.\n\n\u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 305\u00ad7\n\n## ELECTRIC MOBILITY\n\nElectric mobility is one of the key topics shaping the future of the BMW Group in terms of sustainable mobility. The in\u00ad creasing  number  of  electrified  models  and  continuously growing sales volume figures place the BMW Group firmly among the leading providers of premium electric mobility worldwide. We see electrification from a holistic point of view and consider it essential to promote electric mobility by put\u00ad ting in place the necessary charging infrastructure as well as customer\u00adfriendly  charging  solutions.  Accordingly,  we  are continuously expanding our range of products and providing a comprehensive range of charging products and services.\n\n## Driving electric mobility forward\n\nOur electrified vehicles are making an essential contribution to driving down fleet emissions and thus to meeting our am\u00ad bitious strategic \u2197 decarbonisation targets right across the value chain. For this reason, we are systematically continuing to electrify our model range as a vital ingredient of our product strategy.\n\n## Drive system diversity\n\nThe BMW Group has always focused its business on the needs of its customers, and our product portfolio amply re\u00ad flects  this  enduring  ambition.  Leveraging  the  benefits  of scalable, modular design and the Group's \u2197 flexible production systems , customers can now choose between fully electric ve\u00ad hicles, plug\u00adin hybrids and efficient conventionally powered models. A prime example of the freedom of choice our cus\u00ad tomers enjoy is the BMW X3, which is the first model series to be available as a plug\u00adin hybrid*, a combustion engine version (both diesel and petrol), and as a BMW iX3* with an all\u00adelectric drive system.\n\nBy the year 2030, at least half of the BMW Group's vehicle deliveries worldwide are set to be fully electric models.\n\nBy  offering  parallel  drive  technologies,  we  are  creating  a smooth transition to the future of electric mobility, while sim\u00ad ultaneously making the best possible use of our existing re\u00ad sources. At the same time, we are systematically continuing to electrify our product range, driven by the dual forces of growing customer demand and regulatory requirements. By 2025, the proportion of electrified automobiles in total Group deliveries is projected to rise to at least 30 %. By the year 2030, at least half of the BMW Group's vehicle deliver\u00ad ies worldwide are set to be fully electric models. Moreover, we intend to put some ten million fully electric vehicles on the road during the next ten years.   By the early 2030s, the BMW Group  plans  to  offer  only  all\u00adelectric  vehicles  to  its MINI and Rolls\u00adRoyce customers. The fact that we are sys\u00ad tematically electrifying both brands has to do with their typ\u00ad ical user profiles, as MINIs are predominantly used for urban driving, while Rolls\u00adRoyce cars are mainly used for shorter distances.",

        "page_content": "Products and Mobility Solutions\n\n## Broader offering\n\nThe BMW Group's range of electrified products consists of purely  battery  electric  vehicles  (BEV 1 )  and  plug\u00adin  hybrid models (PHEV 2 ).\n\nApart from the established all\u00adelectric BMW i3, MINI Cooper SE 6 and BMW iX3 6 models already available, two key inno\u00ad vation drivers were added during the year under report - the BMW iX 6 and the BMW i4 6 . Over the next two years, the all\u00adelectric versions of the BMW 7 Series, the BMW X1, the high\u00advolume 5 Series and the MINI Countryman are set to follow,  as  will  the  all\u00adelectric  Rolls\u00adRoyce  Spectre.  From 2025, we will be rigorously taking the core BMW brand into a new all\u00adelectric dimension with the \u2197 Neue Klasse .\n\nDuring the year under report, the BMW Group also added further engine variants to its PHEV model range with the BMW  320e 6 and  the  BMW  520e 6 .  Including  these  innov\u00ad ations, we are currently offering 17 plug\u00adin hybrid basic mod\u00ad els 3 in a total of 83 markets worldwide. With innovations such as the \u2197 BMW eDrive Zone , extensive charging options and increased ranges, we are enabling drivers of plug\u00adin hybrids to travel electrically as often and over as long a distance as possible. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer 6 compact plug\u00adin hybrid model will be launched in 2022 and capable of trav\u00ad elling up to 80 kilometres (WLTP 4 ) purely on its own battery power.\n\nIn 2021, the BMW Group delivered a total of 328,314 all\u00adelec\u00ad tric and plug\u00adin hybrid vehicles (2020: 192,662 5 ) to custom\u00ad ers, around 104,000 of them with all\u00adelectric drive systems, thus surpassing our self\u00adimposed target of more than doub\u00ad ling our sales of electrified vehicles compared with the 2019 figure (146,158 units). Therefore, at the end of 2021, more than one million BMW Group vehicles with fully electric or plug\u00adin hybrid drive systems were on the road worldwide ( \u2197 Automotive segment ). In the year under report, the percentage\n\nshare of electrified vehicles to total BMW Group deliveries reached 13.0 %.\n\n## Increasing range to suit customer needs\n\nThe BMW Group assesses the increase in electric vehicle ranges from various points of view. We are not aiming to pro\u00ad vide the technically greatest possible range across all vehicle segments as a matter of pure principle. It is far more important to adapt the range to suit the intended use of each individual vehicle. At the same time, we also need to consider the eco\u00ad logical impact, as a longer range means larger and therefore heavier high\u00advoltage batteries. This relationship has a direct effect on resource consumption, the environmental footprint of the respective supply chain, and vehicle weight, which in turn has a significant influence on the overall consumption of a given vehicle.\n\nFor these reasons, the MINI Cooper SE 6 is designed for ur\u00ad ban driving and has a range of more than 200 kilometres (WLTP 4 ), in line with customer requirements. The new BMW iX and i4 models are designed for covering long distances of around 600 kilometres (WLTP 4 ) on just one charge. In view of the customer and usage profiles of both vehicles, we con\u00ad sider these ranges to be optimal. Fully electric vehicles will be capable of achieving ranges of more than 600 kilometres (WLTP 4 ), depending on vehicle size and type, as the use of electric mobility continues to become more widespread.\n\n## Hydrogen\n\nOur customer\u00adoriented technological diversity approach also includes the further development of fuel cell technology, for which we see considerable potential, depending on the seg\u00ad ment. We see electric drive systems that use hydrogen as an energy storage system as a complementary addition to bat\u00ad tery electric mobility and as an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions at an even faster rate. In this context, we present\u00ad ed the \u2197 BMW iX5 Hydrogen at the IAA Mobility 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are also driving hydrogen fuel cell technology forward at a higher level. For example, we are involved in worldwide or\u00ad ganisations and associations, such as the \u2197 Hydrogen Council . As an associated partner of \u2197 H2 Mobility Deutschland GmbH , the BMW Group supports the establishing of infrastructure re\u00ad quired for hydrogen\u00adpowered vehicles. In this context, the BMW Group welcomes the call in the EU's Fit for 55 legisla\u00ad tive package to establish a basic infrastructure of 700\u00adbar hydrogen refuelling stations.\n\n## Expanding charging infrastructure and enabling faster charging\n\nAn expanded, customer\u00adfriendly charging infrastructure will pave the way for the rapid and widespread use of electric mobility. For this reason, the BMW Group is committed to creating  standardised  framework  conditions  and  services that enable easy charging.",

These include charging products and services that benefit customers on the road, at home and at work.\n\nCustomers can use their BMW and MINI charging cards to take advantage of public charging services, providing them with straightforward, transparent access to one of the world's larg\u00ad est  charging  networks  with  over  250,000  charging  points across Europe, of which 48,000 are located in Germany alone, and also include fast\u00adcharging stations with a capacity of over 150 kilowatts (kW). The IONITY European high\u00adpower charging service can also be accessed via BMW Charging and MINI Charging. In 2021, the BMW Group introduced a standardised tariff structure for public charging in 22 European countries. With the Connected Charging application, available both within the vehicle and as a smartphone app, we also enable MINI and BMW drivers to charge their vehicles in a predictive, convenient and cost\u00adefficient manner. The service provides drivers with comprehensive information at any time, including the remain\u00ad ing range of their vehicle and the availability of charging points.\n\nApart  from  the  public  charging  services  they  offer,  BMW Charging and MINI Charging provide a standard charging solution in the form of the Flexible Fast Charger and other charging products designed for home use. BMW also offers charging solutions for corporate customers in collaboration with partners. The BMW Group itself operates one of the largest \u2197 company charging networks in Germany. \u2197 Employee mobility\n\nIn addition to the BMW Charging and MINI Charging ser\u00ad vices,  we  offer  green  electricity  tariffs  and  attractive  solar power services for the home in certain countries, and plans are being put in place to expand this offering to other markets.\n\nThe BMW Group still sees a need for political action in order to better promote electric mobility in many countries and cities. EU market research data highlight the close correlation between the density of charging infrastructure and the sale of electrified vehicles - both at the level of member states and in a comparison of various regions.\n\nWe support political initiatives in favour of sector coupling, with the aim of forming smart connections between the mo\u00ad bility and the energy sectors. The BMW Group is also con\u00ad ducting its own targeted research and development work in this area. For example, as part of a pilot project in California, USA,  customers  can  already  use  the \u2197 BMW  ChargeForward service to synchronise their charging behaviour with grid capacity utilisation and the use of renewable forms of energy ( \u2197 Collaboration with cities ). The further expansion of this tech\u00ad nology is planned.\n\nAnother project aimed at promoting sector coupling is so\u00ad called \u2197 Bidirectional Charging Management (BDL) , which is funded by Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Ener\u00ad gy. BDL transforms electric vehicles into mobile energy stor\u00ad age devices and thus into a part of the energy system in that their batteries are not only able to store electricity, but also simultaneously feed it into the operator's power grid in the opposite direction.\n\n## Recording electric mobility over the entire life cycle\n\nElectrified vehicles need to be as eco\u00adfriendly as possible, not only during their use phase, but also in terms of their overall footprint, including the supply chain. \u2197 Holistic manage\u00ad ment system. In the BMW Group's case, for instance, this was confirmed by the environmental report on the BMW iX3 3 : Over its life cycle, the all\u00adelectric vehicle emits around 40 % fewer carbon emissions 1 than the BMW X3 30i reference vehicle. If the battery is charged using renewable energy only, carbon emissions are even around 67 % lower.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IONITY EUROPEAN FAST-CHARGING NETWORK\n\nAt  European  level,  in  collaboration  with  the  joint  venture \u2197 IONITY, the BMW Group is further expanding a comprehen\u00ad sive, high\u00adperformance, fast\u00adcharging network along major road routes. Depending on the vehicle, charging is particularly fast with capacities of up to 350 kW. All IONITY charging points are publicly accessible, regardless of vehicle brand, and designed in accordance with the European Combined Charging System (CCS) standard. A ubiquitous high\u00adpower charging network is key to achieving sufficient market penetration and ultimately the suc\u00ad cess of electric mobility. All 6,600 IONITY charging points are powered by 100 % green electricity.\n\n\u2197 Cooperations and partnerships\n\nThe environmental impact of a battery vehicle is predomi\u00ad nantly caused in the upstream value chain, where the pur\u00ad chasing of raw materials to manufacture battery cells and the carbon\u00adintensive production of the batteries themselves leave a significant footprint.\n\nFor this reason, the BMW Group sees it as particularly im\u00ad portant to produce components such as the electric motor, high\u00advoltage storage systems, and battery cells in a more sustainable manner. \u2197 Reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain . Other methods of mitigating the environmental impact in\u00ad clude recycling and reusing the high\u00advoltage storage units installed in our BEV and PHEV models. The BMW Group al\u00ad ready offers all customers that use its battery\u00adpowered vehi\u00ad cles to take back their high\u00advoltage batteries free of charge at the end of their life cycle.",

With these aims in mind, we are cooperating with cities around the world and are involved in overarching platforms for mobility, thus mak\u00ad ing our contribution to reducing both traffic density and the associated negative impacts. Via BMW Group subsidiaries, we also offer a range of innovative urban mobility services, which include car sharing, driving and charging services, and a digital, multimodal platform that allows users to conveni\u00ad ently order, combine and use various modes of transport via their smartphones. To make these services more sustain\u00ad able, the YOUR NOW companies FREE NOW and SHARE NOW are gradually electrifying their fleets of vehicles. In addition, the BMW Group is driving forward the connectivity and automation of its vehicles as key elements towards en\u00ad suring eco\u00adfriendly, safe and free\u00adflowing traffic in cities.\n\n## Shaping the future of mobility\n\nThe BMW Group is currently working together with the three German cities of Munich, Berlin and Hamburg, and at inter\u00ad national level with Rotterdam, Los Angeles and Beijing, on cooperative research and implementation projects.\n\nIn Munich, for example, the BMW Group is currently working with partners from the local business community to develop a new model of collaboration between policymakers, stake\u00ad holders and the private sector, building on 25 years of in\u00ad volvement in the so\u00adcalled Inzell\u00adInitiative. The focus is on creating  strategic  measures  for  developing  sustainable transportation in the region.\n\nIn the German capital, the BMW Group is involved in the \u2197 New Mobility Berlin project, which addresses people's chan\u00ad ging mobility needs and the shortage of space in a growing city. Against this backdrop, the project aims to make public street space more flexible to use. The project is looking to create  shared  spaces  to  provide  mobility  stations  for  car sharing or rental bicycles, for example.\n\nIn the \u2197 National Platform for the Future of Mobility , which was set up by the previous federal government, the BMW Group chaired the working group on digitalisation for the mobility sector. The group developed measures to make mobility more cli\u00ad mate\u00adneutral, efficient, convenient and cost\u00adeffective for the future.\n\nIn October 2021, the BMW Group extended its \u2197 cooperation with the City of Rotterdam, which has been ongoing since 2018, for a further six years. One successful example of this collaboration is the BMW eDrive Zone technology, which was launched in 2020. \u2197 BMW eDrive Zone technology\n\nThe importance of cooperation between cities and energy suppliers  was  meaningfully  demonstrated  in  the \u2197 BMW ChargeForward project in California. The project enabled us to demonstrate that intelligently controlled charging coordinat\u00ad ed to suit the availability of renewable energy is more envi\u00ad ronmentally friendly, more energy\u00adefficient and more cost\u00adef\u00ad fective for the customer.\n\n## Range of innovative mobility services\n\nTogether with Daimler Mobility AG, the BMW Group offers mobility services via the joint venture YOUR NOW, which was established in 2019. The YOUR NOW range of services in\u00ad cludes car sharing and the use of e\u00adscooters, e\u00adbikes and e\u00adkick scooters (multimodality) as well as driving and char\u00ad ging services and provides customers with access to the charging infrastructure as well as to alternative means of transportation apart from their own cars. At the same time, they are promoting the expansion of public charging points with their increasingly electrified range of vehicles. All YOUR NOW  subsidiaries  continued  to  consistently  develop  their activities throughout 2021 against a backdrop of pandem\u00ad ic\u00adrelated restrictions.\n\nAs Europe's largest multimodal mobility platform, FREE NOW combines various forms of mobility in one single app. With this strategy, the service brings registered users in European and Latin American cities to their destination quickly and in line with their individual needs. Apart from taxi cabs and private ride services, e\u00adscooters and e\u00adkick scooters, SHARE NOW vehicles have also been bookable via the FREE NOW app since mid\u00ad2021. At the same time, FREE NOW is systematically promoting the electrification of the fleet it uses. FREE NOW intends to grow its share of electrically powered trips to 50 % by 2025 and go all\u00adelectric by 2030.\n\nSHARE NOW is one of the pioneers in the field of car sharing and offers vehicles for on\u00addemand rental. In 2021, the mobil\u00ad ity brand launched its first connection between two metro\u00ad politan  areas  with  the  route  between  Rotterdam  and Amsterdam. Furthermore, SHARE NOW systematically con\u00ad tinued to electrify its vehicle fleet during the year under re\u00ad port and more than a quarter of its vehicles are meanwhile powered by electricity.",

Since 2017, the Group has been pooling the devel\u00ad opment of assistance and automation functions at the Au\u00ad tonomous Driving Campus, located just north of Munich. It also operates research facilities in both China and the USA, the BMW Group's two largest markets in terms of traffic\u00adre\u00ad lated as well as traffic law specifics, the very beginning. In order to develop new technologies to maturity for series pro\u00ad duction and expand our testing capacities, we are currently building a new test site in the Czech Republic.\n\nSince 2021, the Munich\u00adbased research project TEMPUS*, in which the BMW Group is participating, has been following up questions relating to technical feasibility. The project also aims to assess the acceptance of automated traffic systems among the general public.\n\nWith the all\u00adelectric BMW iX, which was launched in 2021, we are also offering state\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adart driver assistance systems. The BMW iX is the first BMW Group vehicle to feature auto\u00ad mated driving and parking functions from a new modular tech\u00ad nology toolkit that will be deployed across the entire product portfolio from next year.\n\nWith  its  BMW  eDrive  Zone  technology,  the  BMW Group  is demonstrating how vehicle connectivity can help make urban mobility more sustainable. Plug\u00adin hybrids equipped with the appropriate  module  can  automatically  switch  to  all\u00adelectric driving when entering a defined zone, making it easier for cus\u00ad tomers to drive emissions\u00adfree as often as possible, provided their vehicles are charged with green electricity. BMW eDrive Zone technology is already available in over 138 towns and cities across Europe.\n\nThe BMW Group gives the safety of its automated systems the highest priority. For that reason, we support the develop\u00ad ment of an industry\u00adwide ISO standard for highly and fully automated driving functions. In 2019, the BMW Group, to\u00ad gether with 11 leading companies in the field of automated driving, published the white paper Safety First for Automated Driving, which was translated into an \u2197 ISO Technical Report in 2020. The work is currently being continued in a worldwide ISO working group and scheduled to be published as an ISO Technical Specification in 2023 with the aim of defining uni\u00ad form technical standards for safe automated driving.\n\nArtificial  intelligence  (AI)  has  been  used  in  BMW  driver assistance systems since 2018. It helps to detect dangerous situations, such as other vehicles swerving into traffic, at an early stage so that the driver can react accordingly. The AI's learning is controlled and safeguarded throughout the pro\u00ad cess. Here, too, the Group is working to achieve the inter\u00ad national harmonisation of AI standards and helped initiate the development of the new ISO Safety and Artificial Intelligence standard in 2021. In this context, as a founding member of the European GAIA\u00adX project, we are committed to establishing a protected, high\u00adperformance data infrastructure as the basis for safe, efficient traffic management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEuropean towns and cities are compatible with BMW eDrive Zone technology.",

The  main technical actions related to exhaust gas recirculation issues and Takata\u00adairbags. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 416\u00ad1, \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex\n\nWe aspire to deliver the highest standards of quality and safety for all BMW Group vehicles. In all measures, the  safety of  people  is  key.  In  its  manufacturing  processes,  the BMW Group avoids the use of any substances that pose a health risk. The active and passive safety systems built into our vehicles ensure greater safety on the road. In our driving safety training courses, we instruct customers on all aspects of safety and show them how to recognise and react appro\u00ad priately to dangerous situations. Responsibility towards our customers also includes the responsible handling of their data. In this respect we focus on transparency, informational self\u00addetermination, data sovereignty and data security.\n\n## Product safety as part of quality management\n\nThe BMW Group operates a comprehensive system of qual\u00ad ity management, as we want to ensure that our products are of  high  quality,  safe  and  compliant  with  the  law.  All BMW Group vehicles are therefore subject to stringent test\u00ad ing from the development stage right through to production. However, our quality management system goes further and also includes the use of our vehicles after they have been delivered to our customers; if any deviations from the quality standard are observed, they are rigorously followed up. The BMW Group  also  informs  the  relevant  authorities  without delay if required to do so by market\u00adspecific regulations. This is especially true for safety\u00adrelated aspects. If a safety risk is detected, the BMW Group implements any technical meas\u00ad ures required in close coordination with the responsible au\u00ad thorities. Corresponding committees, processes and organ\u00ad isations are in place for this purpose, which are controlled by the Product Support, Technical Actions and Warranty Costs department. In the reporting year 2021, safety\u00ad and compli\u00ad ance\u00adrelated technical actions affected 1,920,977 vehicles.\n\n## Effective safety systems\n\nState\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adart safety systems play a major role in reducing the risk of accidents and injuries (active safety) and largely mitigate the consequences of a possible accident (passive safety). Safety begins with key factors such as optimal chas\u00ad sis tuning, highly effective braking systems and stable pas\u00ad senger compartments, but also includes airbags as standard and digital driver assistance systems such as active cruise control,  collision  warning,  lane  guidance  and  emergency braking assistants. They also promote greater safety for all road users. The connectivity and automation of vehicles also provides a growing number of opportunities to improve safe\u00ad ty. The BMW iX sets new standards in this regard, thanks in part to its advanced front collision warning system with brak\u00ad ing intervention, which comes as standard.\n\nWe  work  continuously  on  improving  vehicle  safety.  The \u2197  European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP), a vehicle crash  safety  assessment  scheme,  confirms  the  effective\u00ad ness of the safety measures installed in our vehicles. In the 2021 Euro\u00adNCAP\u00adRating, the BMW iX received the highest rating, just like numerous models did in past years, such as the BMW 4 Series Coup\u00e9 and BMW 4 Series Convertible, thus demonstrating the Group's premium\u00adlevel standards in terms of vehicle safety. \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex\n\n## Pollutants management\n\nThe BMW Group endeavours to meet legal requirements re\u00ad garding the use and handling of pollutants at every stage of the value chain. Right from the design stage, the BMW Group is careful to exclude any substances of concern from its ve\u00ad hicles to the greatest extent possible. In doing so, we use the \u2197 Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL) as a guide. At\n\nAll BMW Group vehicles are subject to stringent quality, safety and legal compliance tests, right from the develop\u00ad ment stage through to production.\n\nthe same time, we are working to reduce emissions in the vehicle interior to an absolute minimum. All BMW, MINI and Rolls\u00adRoyce vehicles are equipped with passenger compart\u00ad ment air filters as standard, reliably filtering out pollutants and particles such as dust or pollen from the outside air. In 2020, the BMW Group fitted passenger compartment air fil\u00ad ters with \u2197 nanofibre filter technology , which keeps certain micro\u00ad bial particles and allergens from entering the vehicle's interior. Since 2021, we have been gradually introducing this technol\u00ad ogy in a range of other BMW Group models.\n\n## Customer awareness and empowerment\n\nThe BMW Group provides its customers with extensive infor\u00ad mation on the correct use of its products and services. Infor\u00ad mation on safety, the proper use of its vehicles, and health protection is available in the integrated operating instruc\u00ad tions in printed form, online, or via an app. The information is supplemented by notes and background tips on services, accessories and the vehicle's various components.",

The Driving Experience teaches participants safe vehicle handling and prepares them for any dangerous situations that may occur on the road. In 2021, more than 100,000 customers world\u00ad wide took part in these training courses.\n\n## Data protection - an essential task\n\nThe BMW Group views data protection as one of the most important tasks in these times of increasing digitalisation. For this reason, the strictest data protection requirements are taken into account at an early stage when developing features and services. Via an individually configurable data protection menu, we provide our customers with transpar\u00ad ency, informational self\u00addetermination and ultimately data sovereignty.\n\n## Customer data protection\n\nAt the BMW Group, data and information protection is based on the relevant laws and standards, particularly the EU Gen\u00ad eral Data Protection Regulation and the ISO / IEC 27001 in\u00ad ternational security standard. The personal data of custom\u00ad ers  are  only  collected,  processed  or  used  to  the  extent legally permitted and with the consent of the data subject. However, should customers have any queries or complaints regarding the protection of their personal data, they are wel\u00ad come to contact the Customer Interaction Centre or the data protection officer in their respective markets.\n\n- In 2021, more than 100,000 customers worldwide took part in BMW and MINI Driving Experience training courses.\n\nAt the same time, we continuously strive to maintain our high level of data protection and regularly check all applica\u00ad tions that process customer data to ensure that they comply with all current and appropriate IT security measures. In the course of this process, we specifically search for any pos sible weak points and eliminate them with teams of IT specialists. We implement any new insights into mandatory corporate standards as the need arises.\n\nThe BMW Group collaborates closely with the relevant data protection  supervisory  authorities  -  particularly  regarding fundamental data protection issues, such as those relating to the increasing connectivity of our vehicles.\n\n## Securely connected\n\nThe BMW Group's responsibility for its products includes the secure transfer of vehicle data to third parties. For this rea\u00ad son, BMW Group vehicles are not directly connected to the Internet, but communicate directly and exclusively with the BMW ConnectedDrive back end via a highly secure connec\u00ad tion in a virtual private network. This strategy enables us to minimise the risk of unauthorised third parties gaining ac\u00ad cess to either the vehicle or the driver's personal data. The point of access to the Internet is controlled via a gateway. We see this Extended Vehicle Approach in accordance with ISO 20078 as the best solution to ensure an outstanding level of data security and protection and to meet statutory cyber\u00ad security requirements (e. g. UN R155).\n\nThe secure transmission of data to third parties was imple\u00ad mented with the introduction of BMW CarData in Germany and Europe (2017) and in the USA (2020). CarData provides BMW and MINI customers with complete transparency and sovereignty over any data transferred to authorised third par\u00ad ties, allowing them to decide independently at any time which data they release to service providers such as workshops, in\u00ad surance companies or fleet managers in order to receive indi\u00ad vidual service offers.",

As production of the all\u00adelectric BMW iX and BMW i4 models began in 2021, we rigorously attuned our vehicle assembly systems to suit the requirements of electric mobility. At the same time, we are benefiting from the high flexibility of our pro\u00ad duction system. During the year under report, this agility en\u00ad abled us to respond both swiftly and specifically to major challenges such as the tense semiconductor supply situ\u00ad ation and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, despite which we still managed to significantly increase production vol\u00ad ume year\u00adon\u00adyear.\n\n## The BMW Group production network\n\nThe BMW Group production network comprises 31 locations in 15 countries. The same high standards of quality, safety and sustainability apply at all Group locations * worldwide. Our state\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adart production facilities enable us to manu\u00ad facture all\u00adelectric, plug\u00adin hybrids and conventionally pow\u00ad ered automobiles all on one line. Electric mobility is playing an increasingly key role in this regard. For example, at the end of 2021, electrified vehicles already accounted for some 26 % of the total number produced at the \u2197 BMW Group plant in Munich .\n\n## TRANSFORMING THE MAIN PLANT IN MUNICH\n\nThe  restructuring  of  its  plant  in  Munich  amply  demonstrates how the BMW Group is transforming itself going forward. Since the  launch  of  the  all\u00adelectric  BMW  i4  in  November  2021,  the BMW Group's main plant has been manufacturing vehicles with all types of drive system on the same production line. From 2023, at least half of all vehicles produced at the Munich plant will be powered by an electrified drive system and the majority of these will be all\u00adelectric models.",

While 20 of its 31 locations are BMW Group plants, three belong to the BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. joint venture in Shenyang (China), which is currently being enlarged to create additional production capacity. Further in\u00ad formation on the consolidation of BMW Brilliance Automo\u00ad tive Ltd. is provided in the \u2197 Notes to the Group Financial Statements . Eight production sites are operated by Group partners or contract manufacturers.\n\nThe BMW Group's automotive partner plants in Jakarta (In\u00ad donesia), Cairo (Egypt), Kaliningrad (Russia) and Kulim (Ma\u00ad laysia) mainly produce BMW and MINI brand models for their respective regional markets.\n\nThe BMW Group also awards contracts to external partners (contract  manufacturers)  to  produce  its  automobiles  and motorcycles in series. During the period under report, Magna Steyr Fahrzeugtechnik produced both the BMW 5 Series Se\u00ad dan and the BMW Z4 in Graz (Austria). VDL Nedcar in Born (the Netherlands) manufactures the MINI Convertible, the MINI Countryman and the BMW X1.

        "page_content": "Production, Purchasing and  Supplier Network\n\n## Restructuring production for electric mobility\n\n## Developing expertise for battery cell production\n\nThe  BMW Group  already  manufactures  automobiles  with all\u00adelectric or plug\u00adin hybrid drive systems at \u2197 13  locations * across its worldwide production network. All\u00adelectric mod\u00ad els are already part of the production programme in Dingolf\u00ad ing, Leipzig, Munich, Oxford and Shenyang, including the BMW iX produced in Dingolfing and the BMW i4, which has been  manufactured  at  the  Munich  plant  since  the  year under report.\n\nBy the end of 2022, every production plant in Germany shall have the capacity to manufacture at least one all\u00adelectric model. From the middle of the decade, the \u2197 Neue Klasse will also feature a cluster architecture consistently geared to pro\u00ad ducing electric drive systems. The new architecture will be deployed for the first time at the Group's new plant in Debre\u00ad cen, Hungary, as well as at the Munich plant, and will be gradually transferred to the BMW Group's global production network in the coming years.\n\n## Component production for electrified vehicles\n\nThe Dingolfing plant now plays a leading role as a compe\u00ad tence  centre  for  electric  drive  systems,  producing  battery modules, high\u00advoltage batteries and fifth\u00adgeneration electric motors, which are also produced at the Landshut plant. The BMW Group  plants  in  Spartanburg  (USA)  and  Shenyang (China) also make high\u00advoltage batteries. The Leipzig plant began  manufacturing  battery  modules  and  other  battery components during the year under report. The Regensburg plant also began producing battery components during the same period. In Thailand, the BMW Group collaborates with a partner that makes high\u00advoltage batteries for electrified ve\u00ad hicles that are produced locally.\n\nThe approval process for the planned pilot plant in Parsdorf near  Munich  for  near\u00adseries  battery  cell  production  came closer  to  completion  during  the  year  under  report.  The BMW Group intends to further optimise the production of battery cells at the Parsdorf plant in terms of quality, perfor\u00ad mance and costs. Since 2019, we have been pooling our knowledge at the Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich. The entire value chain of battery cell technology is concen\u00ad trated at the Centre, including research and development, the composition and design of the battery cell and industrial producibility.\n\n## CIRCULAR ECONOMY, RESOURCE EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nCircularity  is  one  of  our  key  strategic  priorities.  The  in\u00ad creased use of secondary raw materials is a cornerstone of the  BMW Group's  long\u00adterm  decarbonisation  strategy.  We also see the circular economy concept as an important factor in our efforts to significantly mitigate the social and environ\u00ad mental impacts of mining and processing primary raw ma\u00ad terials. The use of secondary materials also has economic benefits, as it conserves primary raw materials. Circularity calls for a holistic strategic approach, beginning at the product design stage and encouraging the increased use of second\u00ad ary raw materials in our supply chain as well as the recycling of BMW Group vehicles at the end of their life cycle. At the same time, in our own production cycles we are systematically pursuing the strategy of conserving resources, improving energy efficiency and continuously cutting emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince 2019, we have been building up relevant knowledge in this field at the Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich.\n\n## Circularity as a strategic priority\n\nThe responsible and efficient use of resources is of great im\u00ad portance  to  the  BMW Group,  which  takes  a  targeted  ap\u00ad proach to the circular economy concept based on the four principles Re:think, Re:duce, Re:use and Re:cycle.\n\nWe are working hard to further integrate the principle of cir\u00ad cularity  in  all  our  processes.  However,  the  availability  of high\u00adquality secondary raw materials is currently limited and in some cases insufficient to meet demand. Depending on material requirements, adequate amounts of secondary ma\u00ad terial are not yet available for every application. As part of its efforts to meet these challenges, the BMW Group is working together with its partners to form closed material loops in the automotive  industry.  In  collaboration  with  BASF  and  the ALBA Group, we are currently testing improved methods of recycling automotive plastics as part of a pilot project.\n\n\u2197 Online\u00adReport\n\n## From product development to recycling\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe efficient use of resources needs to be considered right from the outset, not only during the design process, but also later at the product development stage, and is therefore an essential requirement. The BMW Group aims to design its vehicles so that as many material cycles as possible are closed. We summarise this principle under the concept of circular design. With the BMW i Vision Circular, we have shown that we are taking a critical look at the trend towards increasingly complex composites of materials and analys\u00ad ing new approaches to using compounds of (mono)mater\u00ad ials ( \u2197 Innovations ).",

This principle can only be deviated from in justi\u00ad fied exceptional cases.\n\nAt the end of a product's life cycle, it needs to be possible to increasingly separate and recycle key groups of materials at a high degree of purity so that they can be reused in the automotive industry in so\u00adcalled closed loops. The strategy reduces the need for primary materials and thus the neces\u00ad sity to source potentially critical raw materials.\n\n\u2197 Average distribution of materials in BMW Group vehicles\n\nIn this context, the BMW Group regards end\u00adof\u00adlife vehicles as a source of secondary materials. We therefore promote the recovery of end\u00adof\u00adlife vehicles, components and mater\u00ad ials in order to reintegrate them in the raw materials cycle. Together with its national sales organisations, the BMW Group has already introduced take\u00adback systems for end\u00adof\u00adlife vehicles in 30 countries and offers eco\u00adfriendly vehicle recycling at more than 2,800 take\u00adback points. All BMW Group vehicles sold since 2008 meet the currently ap\u00ad plicable worldwide requirements for the recycling of end\u00adof\u00ad life vehicles, components and materials. Vehicles are already currently required to be 95 % recyclable (based on vehicle weight). \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 301\u00ad3 \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex\n\n## Preference for secondary materials\n\nThe BMW Group not only wants to create the basic condi\u00ad tions for recycling vehicles, it is also looking to reduce the use of primary raw materials in the automotive value chain. This means closing loops in the production chain, i. e. by re\u00ad turning production remnants to the material supplier or re\u00ad covering materials at the end of a product's life cycle. In doing so, we take special care to avoid downcycling these materials into inferior secondary materials. By 2030, the BMW Group aims to take the recycling process to a new level, while at the same time further increasing the proportion of secondary materials it uses to manufacture its vehicles. To\n\nCurrently, an average of up to 30 % 1 of the components used in vehicle manufacture across Europe originate from recycled and reused materials. However, the percentage of material  recycled  differs  considerably,  depending  on  the group. While the recycled proportion of many plastics, for example, is in the single\u00addigit percentage range, secondary cast aluminium is already used at a rate of over 50 % in cer\u00ad tain components.\n\nThe use of secondary raw materials also significantly re\u00ad duces carbon emissions compared with primary materials for example around 80 % of aluminium and up to 70 % of steel 2 are recycled. At the same time, this strategy reduces the amount of natural resources and critical raw materials that need to be extracted. The circularity principle also helps to more effectively mitigate risks that can be associated with the  extraction  of  primary  raw  materials  -  from  market\u00ad related or even political availability risks to those relating to environmental and social standards.\n\nIn general, any secondary raw materials used have to meet the same strict requirements as primary materials in terms of quality, safety and reliability. Therefore, the market avail\u00ad ability of these high\u00adquality materials needs to increase sig\u00ad nificantly. In order to improve the structural framework condi\u00ad tions  required  to  achieve  this  aim,  both  cross\u00adindustry approaches and political initiatives are necessary.\n\n## \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex\n\n## Investments in resource\u00adfriendly technologies\n\nThe BMW Group invests, partly through its \u2197 own venture capital fund , in key technologies that can make a decisive contribu\u00ad tion to achieving carbon neutrality and conserving re sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith this point in mind, through BMW i Ventures we have been investing in the US start\u00adup Lilac Solutions since 2021. Lilac is pursuing the goal of extracting lithium from the brine of saltwater deposits using ion exchangers, deploying a far more eco\u00adfriendly method that conserves resources more effectively than conventional processes. Since the year un\u00ad der report, our investments through BMW i Ventures have additionally focused on an innovative process developed by the US start\u00adup Boston Metal for producing steel without generating carbon emissions. We have also entered into an agreement with the Swedish start\u00adup H2 Green Steel to pur\u00ad chase hydrogen steel produced using green electricity.\n\n## Resource management at every location\n\nThe BMW Group wants to lead the way by keeping resource consumption and carbon emissions in its production pro\u00ad cesses to an absolute minimum. Apart from \u2197 carbon emissions , the other relevant variables are energy and water consump\u00ad tion, waste for disposal, the use of solvents and the \u2197 reduction of solvent emissions (VOC) .",

Each facility, area and building is assigned to an internal op\u00ad erator, who is responsible not only for the technical systems and the smooth running of processes and procedures, but also for their environmental impacts 1 .\n\nA certified environmental management system in accord\u00ad ance with ISO 14001 is implemented at every BMW Group production site. A total of five competence centres, i. e. Emis\u00ad sions,  Water,  Waste,  Qualification  and  the  Environmental Management System, coordinate environmental protection measures throughout the BMW Group worldwide. According\u00ad ly, any ecological improvements that have proven to be effec\u00ad tive at one location are implemented at other locations to the extent possible. Continuous training and the exchange of ex\u00ad periences among employees ensure the transfer of know\u00ad ledge and the Group\u00adwide application of the latest findings. In  the  year  under  report,  our  environmental  management system again made a major contribution to ensuring that there were no significant environmental incidents involving the payment of fines throughout the production network.\n\n## Water\n\nThe BMW Group pursues the aim of continuously reducing the amount of water used in its production processes. Ac\u00ad cordingly, its production plants optimise their circulation sys\u00ad tems,  for  example  by  treating  wastewater  and  putting water\u00adsaving processes in place. One example is the dry separation system used in the paint shop. Other closed\u00adloop\n\nsystems are also currently being tested in the painting pro\u00ad cess and gradually introduced throughout the Group's pro\u00ad duction network. Specific \u2197 water consumption in production was improved slightly to 2.15 m 3 (2020: 2.25 m 3 ) per vehicle pro\u00ad duced during the year under report.\n\n## Waste\n\nIn its efforts to reduce the volume of waste it generates, the BMW Group  deploys  coordinated  recycling  and  treatment concepts adapted to the waste streams in its various plants, to regionally applicable regulations and to locally existing waste  disposal  structures.  In  2021,  99.2 % 2 of  the  waste generated by production processes was either recycled or recovered. During the year under report, the \u2197 volume of waste for disposal per vehicle produced decreased to 2.90 kg, 12.9 % lower than the 2020 figure. We aim to maintain this high recycling and recovery rate within the BMW Group as we increasingly transition to electric mobility. We are therefore integrating the  newly  generated  waste  streams  in  our  recycling  and treatment systems. \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex\n\n## Solvents\n\nThe BMW Group reduced its emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC 3 ) per vehicle produced by 13.6 % to 0.70 kg during the period under report. The year\u00adon\u00adyear improve\u00ad ment was mainly due to the use of solvent\u00adfree cleaning agents and the new thermal afterburners deployed in the paint shops at the Group's plants in Shenyang (China) ( \u2197 Sol\u00ad vents per vehicle produced ). Due to the progress made in the use of solvent\u00adfree substances and the optimisation of our paint shops, we expect to see a further reduction in emissions lev\u00ad els going forward. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 305\u00ad7\n\n## Carbon emissions at BMW Group locations\n\nCompared with the base year 2019, the BMW Group intends to reduce the average amount of carbon emissions per ve\u00ad hicle produced by a further 80 % by 2030. Production accounts for biggest share of the \u2197 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions generated by the BMW Group and this is where the greatest\n\nAn 80 % average reduction of carbon emissions per vehicle produced by 2030.\n\nopportunities to further reduce these emissions lie. As in the past, we are focusing on additional energy efficiency meas\u00ad ures, the increasing generation of our own electricity from renewable sources, the purchasing of green electricity from supply contracts, and the use of certificates of origin.\n\nThe remaining emissions are largely due to the use of nat\u00ad ural gas. Here we face the challenge of replacing natural gas with non\u00adfossil energy sources such as biogas, hydrogen or renewable electricity. The 'heat transition' required to do so is made more complicated by the physical availability of al\u00ad ternative energy sources, the technical retrofitting of plants, and political framework conditions.\n\n## Energy management and efficiency\n\nIt is vitally important to use energy in an efficient, responsible manner in order to conserve resources. The BMW Group has processes in place throughout the organisation to plan and implement energy management measures with the aim of continuously optimising its use. Clear roles are assigned with corresponding responsibilities, targets and reporting obligations to the central strategy departments, the regional controlling bodies and the various production plants at local level.\n\nThe BMW Group invests systematically in the energy effi\u00ad ciency of its global production network, enabling it to cut the energy consumption of machines to a minimum, such as those deployed to generate the required processing heat in its  paint  shops.  The  limited  availability  of  semiconductor components  compelled  the  BMW Group  to  make  adjust\u00ad ments to its production programme during the year under",

For this reason, absolute consumption 3 within the BMW Group increased to 6,476,955 MWh during the year under report (2020: 6,040,824 MWh). However, at 2.10 MWh per vehicle produced, specific energy consumption in the BMW Group's vehicle production fell by 0.9 % in 2021 compared to 2020. This fact is attributable to various energy efficiency measures as well as improved pro\u00ad duction capacity utilisation. \u2197 Energy consumption in detail \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 302\u00ad1, 302\u00ad3, 302\u00ad4\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nThe BMW Group is committed to the use of renewable ener\u00ad gy at all its locations. Worldwide, all BMW Group production sites 4 and the vast majority of its other locations procure their electricity from renewable self\u00adgeneration plants, direct supply contracts for green electricity, and electricity of certi\u00ad fied origin. We also made additional use of biogas certifi\u00ad cates in the year under report. Moreover, we are increasing the amount of renewable energy generated at our own sites. Additions made during the reporting year included large\u00ad scale photovoltaic installations at our plant in Araquari, Bra\u00ad zil, which generate some of the electricity required for pro\u00ad duction at the site.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt present, however, the BMW Group is unable to entirely cover its electricity requirements by producing its own re\u00ad newable energy, and therefore purchases additional power from renewable and predominantly local or regional sources. We cover an increasing proportion of our electricity require\u00ad ments  through  so\u00adcalled  Power  Purchase  Agreements (PPAs), i. e. direct purchases from defined renewable energy generation  plants,  such  as  the  regional  green  electricity bought in to manufacture the BMW iX and the BMW i4.\n\n## COMPENSATION OF SITE-RELATED CARBON EMISSIONS\n\nThe carbon emissions generated within its own production network  are  already  below  the  1.5\u00b0C  path  calculated  for  the BMW Group. Since the year under report, the BMW Group has been making the remaining carbon footprint generated by its plants  and  other  locations  carbon\u00adneutral  on  the  energy  bal\u00ad ance sheet, including company cars and business trips, through the use of voluntary offsetting certificates. Via this method, we are demonstrably offsetting the associated carbon emissions by supporting external projects. In collaboration with experienced partners such as atmosfair and First Climate, we support climate protection projects that meet strict criteria. As part of the certifi\u00ad\n\ncation process, projects are required to demonstrate, for exam\u00ad ple, the permanence of the decarbonisation impact they achieve. Another vital criterion is additionality, i. e. proof that the project in question would not have come about without financing via carbon offsetting certificates. Furthermore, for the post\u00adKyoto phase of the carbon offsetting market, we emphasise the import\u00ad ance of ensuring that there is no double counting of the emissions saved alongside the nationally determined contributions of the affected countries named in the Paris Climate Agreement. We also ensure that the projects additionally generate a social ben\u00ad efit. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 305\u00ad5",

From  mid\u00ad2021,  however,  supply bottlenecks for semiconductor components and the necessary adjustments to the production programme dampened the positive  trend.  As  a  result, \u2197 absolute  carbon  emissions 3 at BMW Group locations increased to 766,153 t of CO 2 (2020: 734,710 t of CO 2 ) due to the overall increase in energy con\u00ad sumption relating to higher production volumes. In the previ\u00ad ous year, consumption and production volumes were signifi\u00ad cantly lower due to pandemic\u00adrelated restrictions.

The carbon footprint and the use of car\u00ad bon\u00adefficient energy and modes of transport play a significant role in this regard. We are therefore making a major contribu\u00ad tion to transforming the transport sector, pursuing a techno\u00ad logically  open,  innovative  approach  across  all  modes  of transport. In order to ensure sufficient supplies between our plants, however, we were compelled to increase the year\u00adon\u00ad year use of air freight during the reporting year due to issues relating to the supply of semiconductors.\n\nSince the beginning of 2021, in cooperation with transport service providers, the BMW Group has been using low\u00adcar\u00ad bon liquefied natural gas (LNG) on certain European trans\u00ad port routes to cover its production requirements. Depending on availability, we are gradually increasing the biogenic con\u00ad tent of the LNG fuel we use. At the same time, we are in\u00ad creasing the volume of products transported by rail: around half of the vehicles produced leave our plants by rail.\n\n## PURCHASING AND SUPPLIER NETWORK\n\nThe BMW Group's supplier network comprises over 32,000 direct supplier locations worldwide, with whom we maintain direct supplier relationships. Our rigorous partner selection process is based on the criteria of quality, innovation, flexi\u00ad bility, cost and sustainability. To meet the respective due dili\u00ad gence requirements in terms of environmental and social standards, we rely on systematic risk analyses as well as prevention, empowerment and remediation measures. We also use standardised online assessments and audits that are  integrated  in  our  business  processes.  Moreover,  the BMW Group enshrines its obligatory sustainability standards in all its supply contracts.   We have set ourselves the goal of reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain by at least 20 % 4 by 2030 (base year 2019), while simultaneously in\u00ad creasing the use of secondary materials.\n\n## Global network and local procurement\n\nGlobal purchasing, the management of international suppli\u00ad er  relationships,  in\u00adhouse  component  production  and  the efficient management of challenges within the supplier net\u00ad work are key factors in ensuring stable supplies to our pro\u00ad duction sites.

We have also de\u00ad fined and implemented raw\u00admaterial\u00adspecific sustainability requirements for certain components.\n\nIn 2014, we extended our standards to include a multistage due diligence process. Since then, the process has included the procurement of production materials for vehicle models as  well  as  risk\u00adbased,  non\u00adproduction\u00adrelated  goods  and services. Every supplier who has a direct business relation\u00ad ship with the BMW Group is obliged to sign these require\u00ad ments for its manufacturing and delivery locations and pass them on contractually to its respective sub\u00adsuppliers.

We very much welcome the regulation that has now been adopted and are also advocating for Europe\u00adwide directives that ensure fair competitive conditions.\n\nOur sustainability programme has fulfilled key due diligence re\u00ad quirements since 2014. For example, as a preventive measure, the BMW Group requires its suppliers to draw up a guideline on work\u00ad ing conditions and human rights. Since 2019, we only commission suppliers with more than 500 employees if they have a certified occupational health and safety management system in place in\n\naccordance with ISO 45001. Our suppliers are also trained as part of  the  certification  process.  Moreover,  if  we  identify  high\u00adrisk suppliers, we conduct additional audits at the supplier's premises with the help of our own assessors and external auditors.

To raise awareness of social and environmental standards in the supply chain, we explain interdependencies and clearly describe what we expect of the companies we work together with. Moreover, together with partner companies, in selected cases we are breaking new ground with the aim of taking action at the very beginning of the supply chain. \u2197 Further GRI information \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 412\u00ad2\n\n\u2197 Raw Material Outlook Platform .

We have a clear aspiration to comply with environmental and human rights standards at every level of our supply chains. Sourcing the raw materials required to produce battery cells, such as lithium and cobalt, is generally a highly challenging task. In order to establish trace\u00ad ability and transparency across the supply chain for both of these raw materials and to minimise the identified risks, the BMW Group sources them directly from the producers, and\n\n## ALLIANCE FOR CROSS-COMPANY, DECENTRALISED DATA EXCHANGE\n\nAs part of the Catena\u00adX Automotive Network initiative, the BMW Group is working to establish an open, scalable, decentral\u00ad ised network for the secure exchange of information and data across companies in the automotive value chain. The network is based on an industry consortium funded by the Federal Min\u00ad istry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWK)* consisting of national and international partners from the automotive value chain. Continuously connected data chains will make it possible to create completely digital images of automobiles and the core processes of automotive value creation, so\u00adcalled digital twins. New business processes and services can be either made pos\u00ad sible or collaboratively enhanced, based on these digital twins. By using the European GAIA\u00adX and International Data Spaces Frameworks as the architectural basis for the Catena\u00adX network, the companies involved have already agreed on the essential in\u00ad frastructural principles for project implementation.\n\nmakes them available to its own suppliers in order to produce the current generation of battery cells. The strategy allows us to fully document both the origin and the path of the lithium and  cobalt  we  use,  while  creating  transparency  regarding mining methods at the same time.\n\nFurther measures that serve to meet our due diligence require\u00ad ments include reducing or eliminating the use of so\u00adcalled high\u00adrisk primary raw materials. For example, we have re\u00ad duced the use of cobalt in the cathodes of our current gener\u00ad ation of battery cells to less than 10 %. Our latest generation of electric motors is made without the need for any rare earths.\n\nThe BMW Group also keeps a close eye on raw materials that are classified as so\u00adcalled 'conflict minerals'. These in\u00ad clude ores whose mining and trade are frequently associ\u00ad ated with violations of environmental and social standards. By using standardised applications such as the Conflict Min\u00ad erals Reporting Template (CMRT) of the Responsible Miner\u00ad als Initiative (RMI), the BMW Group ensures the traceability of the raw materials it uses, right from the direct supplier to the certified smelter. \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex\n\n## Mitigating risks through industry initiatives and partnerships\n\nApart from eliminating, substituting or reducing the use of risk\u00adrelated primary raw materials, we rely on close cooper\u00ad ation with our partners in the supplier network. Our aim is to continue reducing the potential negative impacts of our busi\u00ad ness activities in our raw materials supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Traceability of conflict minerals back to the certified mine.\n\nWe also expect our direct suppliers to demand minimum standards in their chain of upstream suppliers, which has been done for all the 37 raw materials we analysed. The BMW Group even goes one step further in this regard be\u00ad cause, as a precautionary measure, we are committed to not using minerals such as cobalt that are extracted from the deep sea. Together with other companies, we have de\u00ad clared this in a \u2197 moratorium .\n\n## CONFLICT MINERAL TUNGSTEN: CLOSING MATERIAL CYCLES\n\nThe circular economy concept is a key method for ensuring the responsible use of raw materials and resources. For example, since the year under report, the BMW Group has been reducing the amount of the primary raw tungsten it requires by introducing a closed material cycle. To achieve this aim, we collect discarded drill and screw inserts in our German and Austrian plants, re cycle them,  and  have  new  tools  manufactured  from  the  secondary raw material obtained. Apart from reducing our consumption of primary raw materials, the strategy also cuts carbon emissions. \u2197 SASB\u00adIndex",

We therefore re\u00ad quire certification in accordance with these standards for prioritised raw materials in our supplier network. \u2197 Online\n\n## Reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\nWith the growing demand for electrified vehicles, the need for suitable components and parts in production is also increas\u00ad ing - and with it the volume of carbon emissions they gener\u00ad ate. If no countermeasures are taken, the supply chain foot\u00ad print of an all\u00adelectric vehicle could be nearly twice that of a conventional combustion engine model, practically eroding part of the benefit of electric driving during the use phase. The BMW Group is reversing this trend and also intends to reduce the volume of carbon emissions generated in the sup\u00ad ply chain by at least 20 % 1 per vehicle by 2030 compared to the base year 2019. To achieve this aim, we have been es\u00ad tablishing decarbonisation as well as other measures among our suppliers as an award criterion since 2020. Within this\n\n## TYRES MADE OF FSC-CERTIFIED NATURAL RUBBER\n\nIn 2021, the BMW Group introduced the use of FSC\u00adcertified tyres on a first vehicle model - the BMW X5 xDrive45e plug\u00adin hybrid 2 - \u2197 FSC\u00adcertified  tyres made of natural rubber, making the BMW Group the first automotive manufacturer in the world to equip its vehicles with tyres based on sustainable, certified natural rubber and rayon - a wood\u00adbased material used to re\u00ad inforce tyres.\n\nframework, we bindingly agreed corresponding measures for 429 contracts awarded in the course of 2021.\n\nOne of the most effective ways of decarbonising the supply chain is the use of green electricity. For this reason, in 2020, we  entered  into  contractual  agreements  with  battery  cell manufacturers to use only energy generated from renewable sources to produce the current generation of battery cells. In 2021, the BMW Group also introduced green electricity as a mandatory criterion for awarding new contracts in its supply chain - and has already concluded green electricity agree\u00ad ments in the awarding of 427 orders, particularly with up\u00ad stream suppliers of energy\u00adintensive products.\n\nThese measures have already enabled the Group to reach agreements that cut carbon emissions 2 by well over 20 million tonnes during the period from 2021 to 2030. For example, car\u00ad bon emissions generated in the supply chain to produce bat\u00ad tery cells for the BMW iX have been reduced by up to 1.5 t CO 2 per vehicle, simply by agreeing to use green electricity to man\u00ad ufacture them. The implementation of the strategic target was incorporated in the necessary areas across the Group in 2021 and will be measured and reported in future by using the key parameter of \u2197 carbon emissions per vehicle produced .\n\n## Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for supplier empowerment\n\nThrough  its  participation  in  the  CDP  Supply  Chain  Pro\u00ad gramme, the BMW Group has been motivating its suppliers to operate sustainably since 2014 and, for example, to use renewable energy in their production processes. The core of the programme is an annual report, which includes a variety of climate\u00adrelated aspects such as decarbonisation and in\u00ad creasing  the  percentage  of  renewable  energy  used.  The BMW Group strongly encourages its suppliers to set targets in line with the Paris Climate Agreement in their efforts to help limit global warming. Together with the BMW Group's specified target for decarbonising the supply chain, this led to a further significant increase in supplier commitment. For example, year\u00adon\u00adyear, supplier participation in the CDP\n\nWe aim to reduce carbon emissions in the supply chain by at least 20 % 1 by 2030 (base year 2019).\n\nSupply Chain Programme increased from 218 to 250 sup\u00ad pliers, which covers 80 % (2020: 79 %) of the BMW Group's production\u00adrelevant purchasing volume. Some 34 % of sup\u00ad pliers (2020: 29 %) had at least a 2\u00addegree\u00adcompliant target system in place and 38 % (2020: 35 %) of suppliers received at least a B rating. As in previous years, in 2021 the average CDP rating among the BMW Group's participating suppliers was a score of C.\n\nThe BMW Group has integrated the assessments of the CDP Supply Chain Programme in its key purchasing processes. The  results  are  used  in  supplier  discussions,  in  strategic management discussions and in the overall supplier stra t\u00ad egies to point out potential for improvement. They also form a basis  for  determining  the  group  of  bidders  in  purchasing strategies when awarding contracts. The BMW Group uses the CDP's assessment to support and further encourage its own suppliers to implement the Paris Climate Agreement. Suppliers who have participated for some time generally at\u00ad tain a significantly improved CDP rating.\n\n\u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 308\u00ad1, 308\u00ad2, 414\u00ad2",

Current health\u00adrelated topics such as nutrition, exercise and fitness as well as behavioural ergo\u00ad nomics,  cancer  prevention  or  mental  resilience  are  ad\u00ad dressed in action days, dialogue events and training  courses, with the aim of raising employee awareness for these impor\u00ad tant issues.\n\n## Global approach\n\nThe BMW Group places great emphasis of ensuring that all employees have access to its in\u00adhouse health services. In Germany, these services focus on providing acute care for employees and temporary workers during working hours. In certain countries, however, the Group's health service also takes on primary care tasks, such as at the sites in Thailand, India or Mexico. The BMW Group's Company doctors also advise employees on individual preventive measures if re\u00ad quested to do so, and help them adapt their work environ\u00ad\n\n## MEASURES ADOPTED IN LIGHT OF THE CORONAVIRUS  PANDEMIC\n\nThe SARS\u00adCoV\u00ad2 occupational health and safety regulations applicable for Germany and the Works Agreement concluded in 2020 continued to apply in 2021. A Group\u00adwide 'Corona Manual', which is updated regularly, provides guidelines for implementing infection control measures. In addition to protection and hygiene concepts, the emphasis of the prevention efforts made during the year under report was on the vaccination of employees. The BMW Group's health service teams carried out Covid\u00ad19 vacci\u00ad nations at numerous international plant locations. In Germany alone, the BMW Group carried out almost 50,000 vaccinations in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nment to ensure that their health and performance are main\u00ad tained in the long term. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 403\u00ad3, 403\u00ad6\n\nOne of the parameters the BMW Group uses to quantify the success of its health management measures is the sickness rate. At 3.4 %, the sickness rate at BMW AG was at the same level to one year earlier (2020: 3.4 %). The Group continu\u00ad ously strives to improve this figure. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 403\u00ad10\n\n## Occupational safety and ergonomics at Group sites\n\nPreventive  measures  such  as  safe  and  ergonomically  fa\u00ad vourable  workplaces  are  well\u00adestablished  aspects  of  the BMW Group's approach to health protection. The right to health and safety in the workplace is also a key feature firm\u00ad ly embedded in the \u2197 BMW Group's Code on Human Rights and Working Conditions , which includes a commitment to comply with cur\u00ad rently applicable occupational health and safety legislation worldwide. Furthermore, uniform standards applying to all sites are constantly improved, and help to ensure that health and  safety  requirements  are  consistent  throughout  the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 99.72 % of employees at BMW Group plants work at a site covered by an international occupational health and safety management system certified to either ISO 45001 or OHRIS level.\n\n## Certified occupational health and safety management system\n\nIn addition to international cooperation arrangements, occu\u00ad pational health and safety activities throughout BMW Group are coordinated on a global basis in line with a corresponding management system that is certified to ISO 45001 or OHRIS 2 level at 28 out of 31 plants. This means that 70,459 (2020: 69,092) or 99.72 % (2020: 99.7 %) of permanent employees and 14,772 or 98.98 % of temporary employees 3 at BMW Group plants work at a site covered by an international occupational health and safety management system. It is the stated aim of the BMW Group to obtain certification to one of these inter\u00ad national standards for all of its plants by 2025. The only plants for which this remains to be done are the Manaus plant (Bra\u00ad zil), the partner plant in Kaliningrad (Russia) and the contract manufacturing facility in Born (the Netherlands). Employer and employee representatives work together at nearly all locations to bring about a continual improvement in health and safety standards. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 403\u00ad1, 403\u00ad4",

The accident frequency rate  dropped  further  to  2.8  accidents  per  million  hours worked (2020: 3.2). There were no fatal accidents during the year  under  report  (2020:  one) \u2197 Further  GRI  information .  The stated goal is to have occupational health and safety stand\u00ad ards  in  place  throughout  the  Group.

With  this  project,  the BMW Group is going beyond current legal requirements and setting  the  benchmark  for  the  automotive  industry.  The range of risk assessments was expanded to include a mobile workplace analysis in view of the increased scale of working from home.\n\nThe BMW Group uses various management systems to as\u00ad sess the methods and tools deployed across the Group. The results of the assessments are subsequently used to en\u00ad hance internal norms. As part of co\u00addetermination arrange\u00ad ments, the Works Council and, if necessary, the representa\u00ad tives of severely disabled employees and HR management are involved.\n\nThe  BMW Group  ensures  the  quality  of  its  processes  by means of annual internal audits. Audits and certifications of sites are conducted by external service providers. All neces\u00ad sary audits were again successfully performed in 2021, re\u00ad sulting, for example, in the elimination of defects identified in plant and equipment. \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 403\u00ad2\n\n## Regular training for employees\n\nAn important prerequisite for ensuring that its occupational safety and health procedures work well at all locations is the provision of regular training to employees. Responsibility for the training measures implemented in this field lies with the Training Competence Centre, which comprises staff from the occupational safety, ergonomics, environmental protection and health management departments. The seminar curricu\u00ad lum  is  drawn  up  in  collaboration  with  safety  specialists, Company doctors and the BMW Group Academy. The spe\u00ad cialised departments can also be called on to provide solu\u00ad tions to help meet short\u00adterm needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The BMW Group requires its suppliers to comply with internationally recognised occupational health and safety requirements.\n\n## Occupational safety along the value chain\n\nIt is extremely important for the BMW Group that external partners and their employees also find a safe work environ\u00ad ment at our locations and take advantage of the available safety measures. For this purpose, cooperation with con\u00ad tractual parties is regulated in a separate contractor decla r\u00ad ation, enabling potential hazards to be identified and appro\u00ad priate protective measures to be taken on this basis. On large\u00adscale construction sites of the BMW Group, all employ\u00ad ees  of  partner  companies  are  given  safety  briefings  by BMW Group experts. In the case of smaller contracts, the contractor is responsible for performing this duty. The de\u00ad partment responsible for placing the order monitors compli\u00ad ance with the occupational health and safety regulations, supported by the relevant occupational health and safety unit as required.\n\nIn  order  to  improve  occupational  safety  at  the  upstream stages of the value chain, too, the BMW Group requires its suppliers - via the agreed purchasing terms and conditions -  to  comply  with  internationally  recognised  occupational health and safety requirements. 2 \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 403\u00ad7",

A diverse workforce brings with it different perspectives, experiences and competencies - and can therefore make us more in\u00ad novative and competitive as a company. For this reason, we encourage a working environment that actively incorporates different perspectives. We embrace diversity in all its facets on the basis of our diversity concept. Our guiding principle is to create 'a sense of community'  in which people can work together in a spirit characterised by appreciation, mutual un\u00ad derstanding, openness and fairness.\n\n## Embedding diversity\n\nThe BMW Group places great emphasis on an unprejudiced, appreciative and inclusive working environment for all its employees. Key principles such as protection against dis\u00ad crimination, equal treatment of all employees and respect at all times are firmly embedded in the \u2197 BMW Legal Compliance Code and the \u2197 BMW Group Code of Human Rights and Working Conditions .

The BMW Group SpeakUP Line is a telephone service available in over 30 languages that gives employees worldwide the opportunity to report possible violations both anonymously and confi\u00ad dentially (\u2197 Whistleblower Systems for Detecting Possible Legal Violations and Compliance Controls) . \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 406\u00ad1\n\nUsing a variety of training events, presentations and dia\u00ad logue formats, we endeavour to sensitize employees and managers  to  the  positive  contribution  that  diversity  can make to the business. The BMW Group also promotes diver\u00ad sity and equal opportunity in its recruiting and personnel de\u00ad velopment strategies.\n\nDiversity\u00adpromoting concepts have also been developed in relation to the composition of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board. Information on the stipulated diversity criteria and their implementation is provided in the \u2197 Corporate Governance Statement . \u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: Diversity and equal opportunity\n\n## Group\u00adwide initiatives\n\nThe BMW Group is committed to raising awareness for di\u00ad versity throughout the organisation. In this context, for in\u00ad stance, we organise an annual Diversity Week, which in 2021 involved 170 activities aimed at motivating employees world\u00ad wide to address the issue of diversity. The international com\u00ad munication campaign Driven by Diversity was also launched at the same time. The aim of the internal campaign is to make the diverse identities, ways of thinking and experi\u00ad ences of our employees visible and to embed diversity even deeper in the corporate culture of the BMW Group and in the mindset of its employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nEmployee initiatives play a key role in ensuring that diversity is actively practised. For example, two teams from the future talents programme took part in the Germany\u00adwide \u2197 Diversity Challenge of the \u2197 Diversity Charter during the year under report. One of the teams was awarded first place for developing a diversity app.\n\nMany other employees are involved in internal networks that have been set up, including a number of women's networks at various locations and the BMW Group PRIDE group, which campaigns across borders for the interests of the LGBT+* community. \u2197 Sexual Orientation and Identity The dialogue generat\u00ad ed by the aforementioned internal networks creates further momentum for the BMW Group's commitment to support diversity.\n\n## Promoting diversity\n\nThe BMW Group takes an holistic approach to the subject of diversity, focusing primarily on five key dimensions, namely cultural background; age and experience; sexual orientation and identity; physical and mental ability; and gender. The two  departments,  HR  Policy  and  Strategy  and  HR  Ope r\u00ad ations, working together with the relevant disciplinary line managers, are responsible for implementing the measures decided upon.",

An open\u00adminded, unprejudiced and respectful working envi\u00ad ronment is a prerequisite for LGBT+ employees to be able to  contribute  their  full  potential.  For  this  reason,  the BMW Group uses a range of informational events and dia\u00ad logue formats to raise awareness of LGBT+ issues among employees and managers. We are supported in the imple\u00ad mentation of measures by the internal network BMW Group PRIDE. We also send a clear signal to the outside world: in 2021, for instance, we joined the PROUT EMPLOYER net\u00ad work of the \u2197 Prout at Work Foundation and signed the UN Stand\u00ad ards  of  Conduct  for  Business  for  Tackling  Discrimination against LGBTI people.\n\n## Gender\n\nIn  2021,  the  BMW Group  systematically  implemented  the measures decided upon in 2020 aimed at promoting women in the workforce. One focus was placed on future talents and executive management training programmes. \u2197 Increasing  the share of women at all levels . In the Inspired Lead leadership pro\u00ad gramme, for example, gender diversity is taken into account in both the selection of participants and the learning content. The option of filling management functions in tandem (joint leadership) was also well received by employees in the first year  after  the  programme  was  introduced.  In  2021,  our measures relating to the promotion of women were evaluat\u00ad ed externally on the basis of the Women's Career Index.

For example,  the  BMW Group  deliberately  gears  the  Global Leader Development Programme towards international par\u00ad ticipants. As in the previous year, new employees from eight countries  took  part  in  the  programme.  Moreover,  the BMW Group uses various dialogue formats to ensure an un\u00ad prejudiced working environment in a spirit of mutual respect.\n\n## Age and experience\n\nThe BMW Group sees demographic change as both a chal\u00ad lenge and an opportunity. Since 2019, as part of the Senior Expert Programme, retired employees have been passing on their knowledge and experience to their younger colleagues. Conversely,  within  the  Reverse  Mentoring  Programme  or\u00ad ganised by the BMW Group, older employees benefit from the new knowledge of the younger generation.

This begins with providing training opportunities for severe\u00ad ly disabled young people and continues by designing work\u00ad places that meet their needs. We have reaffirmed this as\u00ad piration in 2021 by joining the international initiative \u2197 The Valuable 500 .

According to the provisional calculations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.9 % year\u00adon\u00adyear in 2021. All three major regions Europe, the USA and China - saw an economic recovery.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis hit countries in the eurozone harder than in other major regions. For this very reason, however, the  subsequent  recovery  in  the  worst  affected  European countries was more pronounced. Overall, the economies of the eurozone countries grew by 5.1 % year\u00adon\u00adyear. At 2.7 %, Germany's economy recorded a lower growth rate than other European countries, mainly reflecting the impact of supply shortfalls,  particularly  for  semiconductor  components.  By contrast, the economies of France (+6.7 %), Italy (+6.3 %) and Spain (+5.0 %) all grew strongly, influenced in particular by good progress made on the vaccination front, the easing of pandemic restrictions and the catch\u00adup effects driven by pent\u00adup demand.\n\nDespite its exit from the European Union (EU) and the im\u00ad pact of supply bottlenecks, the economy of the United King\u00ad dom  (UK),  which  had  experienced  a  particularly  severe slump in the previous year, recovered in 2021, with GDP up by 7.0 %.\n\nThe US economy grew by 5.7 % year\u00adon\u00adyear. The US labour market also staged a recovery in 2021. Although the USA's employment figures have not yet returned to pre\u00adcrisis  levels, some sectors are already seeing labour shortages.\n\nChina's economic growth rate rose to 8.1 % in 2021, well up on the previous year, boosted in particular by a renewed sharp rise in exports. However, the pace of growth slowed somewhat towards the end of the year due to weaker con\u00ad sumer demand.\n\nAfter contracting significantly in 2020, Japan's economy re\u00ad covered slightly during the first half of 2021. Despite exten\u00ad sive stimulus packages, however, the second half of the year saw a drop in economic output, with the year\u00adon\u00adyear growth rate finishing at 1.8 %.",

Towards the end of the year, a number of central banks announced their intention to modify their pre\u00ad vious highly expansionary monetary policies.\n\nThe bandwidth of fluctuation in the US dollar / euro exchange rate was slightly narrower in 2021 than in the previous year. The US currency fluctuated between 1.23 and 1.12 US dollars to the euro and weakened somewhat compared to the previ\u00ad ous year with an average rate of 1.18 US dollars to the euro in 2021. Both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal  Reserve  (Fed)  left  their  benchmark  interest  rates unchanged.  Towards  the  end  of  the  year,  however,  they announced that bond purchases would be curtailed.\n\n## EXCHANGE RATES COMPARED TO THE EURO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Reuters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPost\u00adBrexit, the British pound remains fairly close to the lower value it fell to after the 2016 referendum. However, at an average rate of 0.86 pounds to the euro, the British cur\u00ad rency was slightly stronger than in previous years. In re\u00ad sponse to the high inflation rate, the Bank of England (BoE) raised the official bank rate by 15 basis points to 25 basis points in December 2021.\n\nIn China, the rapid recovery of the domestic economy and the sharp growth in exports in 2021 led to a continuous ap\u00ad preciation of the Chinese renminbi. On average over the year, the Chinese currency traded at 7.63 renminbi to the euro. Bucking the international trend, the Chinese central bank lowered the reserve requirement ratio for most banks by 50 basis points at the end of 2021, thereby easing its monetary policy in order to shore up the economy.\n\nThe average exchange rate of the Japanese yen was 130 to the euro during the year under report.\n\nAs in the previous year, the currencies of major emerging markets weakened again in 2021 due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. While the average value of the Indian rupee fell by around 3 % against the euro, the Russian rou\u00ad ble depreciated by 5 % and the Brazilian real by as much as 8 % on average against the euro.",

Average prices for steel and aluminium rough\u00ad ly doubled year\u00adon\u00adyear, but fell again slightly towards the end of the 12\u00admonth period.\n\nPrices for precious and non\u00adferrous metals also followed a similar trend. After rising sharply through to mid\u00ad2021, prices fell again during the second half of the year, particularly for\n\nrhodium and palladium. Lower demand from the automotive industry also had a dampening effect on prices.\n\nPrices of raw materials for batteries, however, rose signifi\u00ad cantly, mainly due to the growing demand for electric ve\u00ad hicles. Quoted prices for cobalt, for example, were up almost twofold compared to the low for the year recorded one year earlier. Similarly, the average price of lithium almost doubled year\u00adon\u00adyear.\n\n## DEVELOPMENT OF METALS PRICES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Reuters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STEEL PRICE TREND\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Working Group for the Iron and Metal Processing Industry.",

Favourable selling price trends for new and pre\u00adowned vehicles as well as the partial reversal of the provision for the EU antitrust proceed\u00ad ings resulted in the EBIT margin forecast for the Automotive segment being adjusted during the year. Due to lower risk provisioning expense recognised for expected residual value and credit risks, higher profits on the resale of lease returns and the reversal of credit risk allowances, the BMW Group also adjusted its forecast for the return on equity (RoE) range.

        "page_content": "Financial Performance\n\n## Retail vehicle delivery data*\n\nIn 2020, BMW Group reviewed and revised its policies and procedures for the reporting of retail vehicle delivery data for automobiles in order to further improve the reliability and validity of its retail vehicle delivery data, in particular with re\u00ad spect to the timing of the recognition of retail vehicle deliver\u00ad ies (the Revised Reporting Process). BMW Group has ap\u00ad plied  the  Revised  Reporting  Process  to  all  markets  with effect from the year 2020. While BMW Group revised retail vehicle delivery data for certain of its most significant mar\u00ad kets for the years 2016 through 2019 presented in this report, such data were not revised for BMW Group's other markets. As a result, retail vehicle delivery data presented in this re\u00ad port for the years 2016 through 2019 is not directly compa r\u00ad able to such data presented for the years 2020 and 2021. Specifically, the retail vehicle delivery data for automobiles presented in this report have been revised as follows:\n\nWhen presenting total retail vehicle delivery data for auto\u00ad mobiles other than model\u00adby\u00admodel data, data relating to the years 2016 through 2019 for BMW Group's 16 most sig\u00ad nificant markets were adjusted to reflect the Revised Report\u00ad ing Process. In the years 2016 through 2019, these 16 mar\u00ad kets represented  on  average  approximately  87 %  of BMW Group's total retail deliveries of automobiles. For each of the years 2016 through 2019, these revisions amounted to less  than  1 %  of  BMW Group's  total  retail  deliveries  of automobiles.\n\nThe  retail vehicle delivery data  for automobiles  for BMW Group's other markets have not been adjusted for any period prior to 2020, nor have any retail vehicle delivery data for motorcycles been adjusted for any period prior to 2020. BMW Group believes the impact on BMW Group's retail ve\u00ad hicle delivery data presented in this report of such data not having been adjusted to reflect the Revised Reporting Pro\u00ad cess to be immaterial.\n\nThe preparation of BMW Group's retail vehicle delivery data involves  a  variety  of  estimates  and  judgments,  some  of which are complex and all of which are inherently subjective, and  is  subject  to  other  uncertainties.  In  addition,  as BMW Group continues to enhance its policies and proce\u00ad dures regarding retail vehicle delivery data, it may not always be practicable for BMW Group to adjust prior\u00adperiod data (and any such adjustments would be of a de minimis nature without any material impact on the comparability of periods). Examples of the foregoing include:\n\n- - The vast majority of deliveries of vehicles are carried out by independent dealerships or other third parties, and BMW Group is reliant on such third parties to correctly re\u00ad port relevant data to BMW Group.\n- - The definition of deliveries includes vehicles delivered in the United States and Canada if the relevant dealers des\u00ad ignate such vehicles as service loaner vehicles or demon\u00ad strator vehicles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Retail vehicle delivery data for periods prior to 2020 in\u00ad clude an immaterial number of pre\u00adseries vehicles that were never intended to be sold to end users (such as ve\u00ad hicles for use by government agencies in connection with safety evaluations (e. g., crash tests) or for other tests).\n\nRetail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenue that BMW Group recog\u00ad nizes in respect of such reporting period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In accordance with the updated Statement of Objections received on 20 May 2021, the EU Commission dropped most of the original charges. Remeas\u00ad urement of the provision originally recognised in the financial year  2019  gave  rise  to  a  positive  impact  on  earnings  of around one billion euros in the second quarter 2021. The pro\u00ad ceedings were concluded by settlement on 8 July 2021 and resulted in a fine of approximately \u20ac 373 million, which was paid in July 2021. Further information, in particular relating to further antitrust proceedings and civil lawsuits, is provided in note 38 to the Group Financial Statements 2021.\n\n## Increase in Group net profit in 2021\n\nGroup revenues were significantly higher in the financial year 2021, reflecting the impact of coronavirus\u00adrelated dealership closures in the previous 12\u00admonth period (2021: \u20ac 111,239 mil\u00ad lion; 2020: \u20ac 98,990 million; + 12.4 %). Sales volume was\n\nalso higher in 2021, whereby the increase was held down by production shortfalls due to supply bottlenecks for semicon\u00ad ductor components. However, this un favourable impact was more than offset by improved pricing, due to both the grow\u00ad ing desire for individual mobility on the one hand and the reduced worldwide availability of products triggered by those same semiconductor component shortages on the other. In addition, revenues were also boosted by favourable product mix effects due to increased sales of high\u00adrevenue models. The semiconductor scarcity was also reflected in higher sell\u00ad ing prices on pre\u00adowned vehicle markets, which in turn gave rise to higher revenues from the sale of lease returns.\n\nGroup cost of sales rose to \u20ac 89,253 million (2020: \u20ac 85,408 mil\u00ad lion; + 4.5 %), mainly due to sales volume growth.\n\nOther factors influencing the increase were volume\u00adrelated cost of sales for lease returns, rising raw materials and energy prices, and the higher proportion of electrified vehicles sold. Furthermore, reversals of and lower additions to credit risk al\u00ad lowances as well as the remarketing result arising on the sale of lease returns had a positive impact on cost of sales.",

Other financial result was additionally impacted by positive valuation effects, primarily arising on investments held by the BMW i Ventures fund and on the investment in SGL Carbon  shares.\n\nThe increased at\u00adequity result from the Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, amounting to \u20ac 1,727 million (2020: \u20ac 1,212 million) was another key driver of the improved financial result.\n\nAs  forecast  most  recently  in  the  Quarterly  Statement  to 30 September 2021, Group profit before tax of \u20ac 16,060 mil\u00ad lion  was  significantly  higher  than  one  year  earlier  (2020: \u20ac 5,222 million) and therefore in line with expectations.\n\nIncome tax expense for the year increased to \u20ac 3,597 million (2020: \u20ac 1,365 million), mainly due to the significant year\u00ad on\u00adyear improvement in Group profit before tax. The effec\u00ad tive  tax  rate  for  the  12\u00admonth  period  was  22.4 %  (2020: 26.1 %), reflecting the partial reversal in 2021 of the risk pro\u00ad vision in connection with the antitrust proceedings of the EU Commission as well as the impact of fair value measurement gains within other financial result.\n\nThe size of the workforce decreased slightly to 118,909 em\u00ad ployees year\u00adon\u00adyear and was therefore in line with expec t\u00ad ations (2020: 120,726 employees; - 1.5 %).\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nA substantial part of research and development expenditure in 2021 related to new vehicle models (including the all\u00adelec\u00ad tric BMW iX and BMW i4 models and the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer) as well as the development of digital products, automated driving and new architectures. The year\u00adon\u00adyear rise in research and development expenses clearly reflects the increase in vehicle and module production start\u00adup activ\u00ad ities as the BMW Group continues its electric offensive.\n\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses im\u00ad proved significantly, primarily due to the income arising on the partial reversal of the provision relating to the antitrust proceedings of the EU Commission, which was recorded in the second quarter 2021.\n\nAs a result of the various factors described above, profit before  financial  result  jumped  to  \u20ac  13,400 million  (2020: \u20ac 4,830 million).\n\nThe financial result improved significantly to a net positive amount of \u20ac  2,660 million (2020: net positive amount of \u20ac 392 million), influenced in particular by improvements in the line items 'Other financial result' and 'Result from equity accounted investments'.\n\nOther financial result benefited in 2021 from the continued favourable fair value development of interest rate hedges re\u00ad sulting from the rise in yield curves in the USA, whereas in the previous year the downward trend in interest rates gave\n\n## BMW GROUP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES\n\n| in \u20ac million  2021                                        | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Research and development expenditure 6,870                | 6,279   |\n| New expenditure for capitalised development costs - 2,506 | - 2,300 |\n| Amortisation 1,935                                        | 1,710   |\n| Research and development expenses 6,299                   | 5,689   |\n\n## BMW GROUP PERFORMANCE INDICATORS RELATING TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES\n\n| in %                                          |   2021 |   2020 | Change in   %\u00adpts.   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|\n| Research and development expenditure ratio  1 |    6.2 |    6.3 | - 0.1               |\n| Capitalisation rate  2                        |   36.5 |   36.6 | - 0.1               |\n\n- 1 Research and development expenditure as a percentage of Group revenues.\n- 2 Capitalised development costs as a percentage of research and development expenditure.",

In the previous year, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and the receipt of a dividend from BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, also had a positive effect on the net cash flow from investing activities.\n\nThe change in the net cash outflow from financing activities mainly reflected the higher level of financial liabilities pay\u00ad able to BMW Group companies in which an investment is held as well as the lower dividend paid out for the 2020 pan\u00ad demic year.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\n## FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE BMW GROUP\n\nThe consolidated cash flow statements for the Group and the Automotive and Financial Services segments show the sources and applications of cash flows for the financial years 2021 and 2020, classified according to operating, investing and financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statements correspond to the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.\n\nCash flows from operating activities are determined indirect\u00ad ly, starting with Group / segment profit before tax. By con\u00ad trast, cash flows from investing and financing activities are based on actual payments and receipts.\n\nThe main factors driving the higher net cash inflow from op\u00ad erating activities were the Group's improved profit before tax on the one hand and the overall change in working capital on the other. Within working capital, the rise in trade payables due to higher production volumes had a favourable effect, while the increase in inventories in the Automotive segment - partially compensated by a decrease in inventories in the Financial Services segment - had an offsetting effect. Within receivables from sales financing, amounts due from retail customers went up on the back of higher business volumes. On the other hand, receivables from dealership financing fell in light of brisk demand and short standing times for ve\u00ad hicles, and therefore had an offsetting effect. The decrease in provisions mainly reflected the partial reversal in 2021 of the risk provision in connection with the antitrust proceed\u00ad ings of the EU Commission.\n\n## BMW GROUP CASH FLOWS\n\n| in \u20ac million                                                 | 2021 2020       | Change   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------|\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from operating activities      | 15,903 13,251   | 2,652    |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from investing activities      | - 6,389 - 3,636 | - 2,753  |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from financing activities      | - 6,735 - 8,254 | 1,519    |\n| Effects of exchange rate and changes in composition of Group | - 307 140       | - 447    |\n| Change in cash and cash equivalents                          | 2,472 1,501     | 971      |",

The decrease in inventories as a consequence of strong demand for lease returns also had a positive impact. The change in the net cash inflow from investing activities was attributable to the combined effect of higher outflows for in\u00ad vestments in and lower inflows from sales of marketable securities.\n\n## REFINANCING\n\nA broad range of instruments on international money and capital markets is used to refinance worldwide operations. Funds raised are used almost exclusively to refinance the BMW Group's Financial Services business. The overall ob\u00ad jective of Group financing is to ensure the solvency of the BMW Group at all times, focusing on three areas:\n\n- 1.   The ability to act through permanent access to stra\u00ad tegically important capital markets\n- 2.   Autonomy through the diversification of refinancing in\u00ad struments and investors\n- 3.   Focus on value through the optimisation of financing costs\n\nFinancing measures undertaken at corporate level ensure access to liquidity for the Group's operating subsidiaries at standard  market  conditions  and  consistent  credit  terms. Funds are acquired in line with a target liability structure, comprising a balanced mix of financing instruments. The use of longer\u00adterm instruments to refinance the Group's Finan\u00ad cial Services business and the maintenance of a sufficiently high liquidity reserve serves to rule out any imminent liqui\u00ad dity  risk  for  the  portfolio.  This  conservative  financial  ap\u00ad proach also has a favourable effect on the Group's rating. Further  information  is  provided  in  the  section  'Liquidity risks' within the chapter \u2197 Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management .\n\nFocused capital market management, good ratings and the high  level  of  acceptance  enjoyed  by  the  BMW Group  on those markets enabled it to refinance itself on the world's debt  capital  markets  at  favourable  conditions  during  the period under report. In addition to bonds, the BMW Group also issued commercial paper in 2021. As in previous years, all issues were in high demand, not only from institutional investors, but also from private investors in selected transac\u00ad tions.  Moreover,  retail  customer  and  dealership  financing receivables as well as rights and obligations from leasing contracts are securitised in the form of asset\u00adbacked secur\u00ad ities (ABS) financing arrangements. Specific banking instru\u00ad ments, such as the customer deposits used by the Group's own banks in Germany and the USA, are also deployed for financing purposes. In addition, loans are taken from inter\u00ad national banks.\n\nIn  2021,  the  BMW Group  issued  bonds  totalling  approxi\u00ad mately \u20ac 6.9 billion. The BMW Group refinanced itself by means of 144A transactions with a total volume of 4.5 billion US dollar on the US capital market and by means so\u00adcalled Panda bonds with a volume of 9.5 billion Chinese renminbi on  the  Chinese  capital  market.

The syndicated credit line of  \u20ac 8 billion has a term ending in July 2024 and is being made available by a consortium of 44 international banks.\n\nThe credit line was not being utilised at 31 December 2021.

Including  currency  effects  from  the  US  dollar,  the  British pound and the Chinese Renminbi, amongst others, the bal\u00ad ance sheet total grew solidly compared to the previous year 2 .\n\nAdjusted for currency effects, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets all went up year\u00adon\u00adyear, driven by higher capital expenditure, particularly in connection with the electrifi\u00ad cation of the vehicle fleet as well as new model revisions.\n\nBased on constant currencies, leased products were slightly highly than one year earlier. Although the contract portfolio under management was at a similar level compared to the previous year, leased products in the balance sheet grew as a consequence of volume growth as well as the higher aver\u00ad age financing volume per vehicle, the latter brought about by an improved product mix.\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method (adjust\u00ad ed  for  currency  effects)  increased  significantly  over  the 12\u00admonth period under report, mainly driven by the rise in the BMW Group's at\u00adequity valuation of the Chinese joint ven\u00ad ture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, in light of that entity's higher earnings and the fact that it did not pay out a dividend during the financial year 2021.\n\nReceivables from sales financing (adjusted for currency ef\u00ad fects) went down slightly compared to 31 December 2020, primarily due to the decrease in dealership financing, mainly in the USA, Germany, the UK and France. The currency\u00adad\u00ad justed decrease in dealership financing receivables was par\u00ad tially offset by rising retail customer financing. Overall, how\u00ad ever, receivables from sales financing grew slightly. A total of 1,334,853  new  credit  financing  contracts  were  concluded",

Driven by brisk demand and an attractive product range, automobile deliveries grew by a solid 8.4 % to a total of 2,521,514 1 BMW, MINI and Rolls\u00ad Royce brand vehicles (2020: 2,325,179 1 units), enabling the BMW Group to extend its lead in the premium segment.\n\nDeliveries 2 of BMW brand vehicles grew by 9.1 % to 2,213,790 1 units (2020: 2,028,841 1 units). MINI also recorded an in\u00ad crease, with deliveries rising to 302,138 units (2020: 292,582 units; +3.3 %). Rolls\u00adRoyce Motor Cars delivered a total of 5,586 units (2020: 3,756 units; +48.7 %), the highest figure recorded for the luxury marque to date.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\n## Deliveries of electrified vehicles at record level\n\nElectric mobility continues to gain in significance for the en\u00ad tire sector and is a key driver of sales volume growth for the BMW Group. The trend is reflected in the sharp rise in the sale  of  electrified  models  offered  by  the  BMW  and  MINI brands.\n\nWith a total of 328,314 3 units, deliveries jumped sharply by 70.4 % in the year under report (2020: 192,662 3 units). De\u00ad mand  was  particularly  strong  for  the  Group's  all\u00adelectric models and delivery figures more than doubled year\u00adon\u00adyear to  103,854 3 units  (2020:  44,541 3 units;  +133.2 %).  Their share of total delveries was 4.1 % (2020: 1.9 %) in the year under report. Two additional all\u00adelectric models, the BMW iX 4 and the BMW i4 4 , went on sale towards the end of 2021, both of which have been highly acclaimed in the trade press. By the end of the period under report, the BMW Group had a total of 14 electrified models on the roads. In 2022, the prod\u00ad uct range will be expanded to include the all\u00adelectric BMW i7 luxury sedan and the BMW iX1. The increased share of deliv\u00ad eries accounted for by electrified vehicles and the rigorous use of Efficient Dynamics technologies enabled further pro\u00ad gress to be made in decarbonising fleet emissions.

However,  this  un\u00ad favourable impact was more than offset by improved pricing due to both the growing desire for individual mobility on the one hand and the reduced worldwide availability of products triggered by those same semiconductor component short\u00ad ages on the other. Other factors with a positive impact on segment revenues were the increased volume of high\u00adre\u00ad venue vehicles sold, the exceptionally strong performance of pre\u00adowned vehicle markets and hence better residual values and growth in spare parts and accessories business.\n\nSegment cost of sales rose significantly to \u20ac 78,637 million (2020: \u20ac 71,456 million; + 10.0 %), whereby the year\u00adon\u00adyear increase was primarily attributable to sales volume growth. Further negative factors included rises in raw materials and energy prices, higher expenses due to the increasing propor\u00ad tion of electrified vehicles, larger allocations to provisions for performance\u00adrelated remuneration components and higher research and development expenses. In the previous year, warranty expenses were impacted by the recognition of pro\u00ad visions in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cool\u00ad er and other warranty\u00adrelated items.\n\nAs described in the section above on the results of opera\u00ad tions for the BMW Group as a whole, the changeover effects arising from the modernisation of the pension model in Ger\u00ad many had a total positive impact of \u20ac 542 million on Auto\u00ad motive segment cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses,  while  higher  expenses  for  performance\u00adrelated remuneration components had an offsetting effect.\n\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses im\u00ad proved significantly, largely due to the partial reversal of the provision for EU antitrust proceedings in the second quarter 2021, as described above.\n\nThe Automotive segment EBIT margin (profit before finan\u00ad cial result as a percentage of revenues) came in at 10.3 % (2020: 2.7 %; + 7.6 percentage points). As forecast in the quarterly statement to 30 September 2021, the EBIT margin was within the target range of between 9.5 and 10.5 % and therefore in line with revised expectations. In the 2020 An\u00ad nual Report, a segment EBIT margin within a target range of between 6 and 8 % was forecast.\n\nAt \u20ac 1,935 million, the Automotive segment's financial result was significantly up on the previous year (2020: \u20ac 560 mil\u00ad lion). As described above, the main driving factors in this re\u00ad spect were the improved result from the at\u00adequity accounted Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shen\u00ad yang, positive valuation effects recognised in other financial result arising on investments held by the BMW i Ventures fund and on the investment in SGL Carbon shares.\n\n## BMW GROUP MARGINS BY SEGMENT\n\n| in %                   | 2021      | 2020   | Change  in %\u00adpoints     |\n|------------------------|-----------|--------|------------------------|\n| AUTOMOTIVE             |           |        |                        |\n| Gross profit margin  1 | 17.6 11.6 | 6.0    |                        |\n| EBIT margin  2         | 10.3 2.7  | 7.6    |                        |\n|                        |           |        | MOTORCYCLES            |\n| 17.8                   | 15.0      | 2.8    | Gross profit margin  1 |\n| EBIT margin  2         | 8.3 4.5   | 3.8    |                        |\n\n- 1 Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues.\n- 2 Profit before financial result as percentage of segment revenues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProfit before tax for the year amounted to \u20ac 11,805 million and was therefore significantly higher than one year earlier (2020: \u20ac 2,722 million).\n\nIn line with expectations, the Automotive segment's RoCE for 2021 rose sharply to 59.9 % (2020: 12.7 %; +47.2 percent\u00ad age points), mainly due to the considerable year\u00adon\u00adyear rise in EBIT on the one hand and the lower volume of capital em\u00ad ployed on the other, the latter attributable primarily to lower average inventories during the financial year under report.",

Despite  the  ongoing  impact  of  semiconductor shortages and pandemic\u00adrelated issues, the revised outlook for the full year, as communicated in the quarterly statement to 30 September 2021, was achieved within a generally fa\u00ad vourable market environment.\n\n## Sales volume growth in nearly all markets\n\nIn Europe, sales volume grew solidly by 8.9 % to 111,126 units in 2021 (2020: 102,026 units). Excellent sales performances were recorded for France with 19,887 units (2020: 17,539 units; +13.4 %), Italy with 16,034 units (2020: 13,918 units; +15.2 %) and Spain with 12,616 units (2020: 11,030 units; +14.4 %). Within a generally contracting market, deliveries in Germany fell moderately to 25,972 units (2020: 27,516 units; - 5.6 %).\n\n## New models launched in the year under report\n\nThe BMW Group brought five new motorcycle models and three model revisions onto the market in 2021. The first of these was the M 1000 RR - the first M model from BMW Motorrad  to  be  powered  by  a  high\u00adperformance  in\u00adline four\u00adcylinder engine - which was launched in February 2021 in the Sports segment. The same month saw the launch of the  R  18  Classic  in  the  Heritage  segment,  based  on  the high\u00adcapacity 1,800 cc R18 boxer engine. The launch was followed in March 2021 by the model revisions of the G 310 R\n\nFinancial Performance\n\n(Roadster segment), the G 310 GS (Adventure segment) and the R 1250 RT (Tour segment). The S 1000 R was also added to the model range in the Roadster segment in May. Last but not least, in September, BMW Motorrad launched the R 18 B and the R 18 Transcontinental models in the Heritage seg\u00ad ment - two further derivatives of the 1,800 cc boxer family.\n\n## BMW GROUP DELIVERIES OF MOTORCYCLES\n\nFigures for the USA were also significantly higher than in the previous year, with deliveries rising at a double\u00addigit rate to 16,030 units (2020: 12,135 units; +32.1 %). The pic\u00ad ture was similar in China, where deliveries climbed by 21.4 % to 14,309 units (2020: 11,788 units). Brazil also saw a slight increase, with deliveries rising to 11,150 units (2020: 10,707 units; +4.1 %).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BMW GROUP -  LARGEST MOTORCYCLE MARKETS 2021\n\nas a percentage of sales volume\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New products unveiled: systematically embracing electrification\n\nThe BMW Group unveiled the BMW Motorrad Vision Amby at the IAA Mobility in 2021. This completely new concept motor\u00ad cycle has been designed as an electrified vehicle that com\u00ad bines the typical elements of a bicycle and a motorcycle. To\u00ad gether with the all\u00adelectric CE 02 concept vehicle, which was presented to the public online in September, these models provide a revealing glimpse of how the future of urban mobil\u00ad ity could look.\n\nBMW Motorrad systematically continued to pursue its elec\u00ad tric mobility strategy throughout the year under report, in\u00ad cluding the unveiling of the CE 04 Electric Scooter (Urban Mobility segment) in July 2021. The launch of this new prod\u00ad uct is scheduled for the first half of 2022.\n\nIn addition, a number of series production models were pre\u00ad sented to the public during the year under report, including the C 400 GT and C 400 X Scooter models in March and the K 1600 GT, K 1600 GTL and K 1600 B Tourer models in October.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Financial Performance\n\n## Results of operations of the Motorcycles segment\n\nThe Motorcycles segment EBIT margin (profit before finan\u00ad cial result as a percentage of revenues) came in at 8.3 % (2020: 4.5 %; + 3.8 percentage points) and thus within the forecast target range of between 8 and 10 %.\n\nProfit  before  tax  for  the  year  was  significantly  higher  at \u20ac 228 million (2020: \u20ac 100 million), mostly driven by favour\u00ad able  product  mix  effects  and  year\u00adon\u00adyear  sales  volume growth, the latter also partially reflecting the adverse impact of coronavirus\u00adrelated dealership closures in the previous year.\n\nThe RoCE for the Motorcycles segment in 2021 was 35.9 % and therefore significantly higher than one year earlier (2020: 15.0 %; + 20.9 percentage points), mainly due to the im\u00ad proved EBIT performance, and was therefore in line with the revised outlook communicated in the quarterly statement to 30 September 2021.\n\n## Financial Services segment\n\n## Record segment profit before tax\n\nThe financial year 2021 was a successful one for the Finan\u00ad cial Services segment, with profit before tax up by 117.6 % to \u20ac 3,753 million (2020: \u20ac 1,725 million). In the previous year, additional risk provisioning expenses for credit and residual value risks had had a negative impact on earnings. The year under report, however, was influenced by the exceptionally positive trend on pre\u00adowned vehicle markets, particularly in the USA and the UK. The upturn on the pre\u00adowned market caused the remarketing values of lease returns to increase sharply.  Alongside  this  favourable  development,  segment earnings also benefited from the unchanged low level of al\u00ad lowances that needed to be recognised for credit risks. The credit loss ratio on the total credit portfolio fell to a historical\u00ad ly low level of 0.18 % at 31 December 2021 (2020: 0.21 %), comprising 0.11 % (2020: 0.16 %) for leasing business and 0.28 % (2020: 0.31 %) for credit financing business with re\u00ad tail customers. Further information on risks and opportun\u00ad\n\nities in the Financial Services segment is provided in the chapter \u2197 Risk and opportunity management .\n\nIn balance sheet terms, business volume grew slightly by 4.8 % to stand at \u20ac 139,530 million at the end of the reporting period (2020: \u20ac 133,093 million).\n\n## New business with retail customers moderately up on previous year\n\nA total of 1,956,514 new credit financing and leasing contracts were  signed  with  retail  customers  during  2021  (2020: 1,845,271 contracts; + 6.0 %). The improved performance in 2021 reflected growth in both new credit financing business (+ 7.8 %) and new leasing business (+ 2.4 %). The biggest in\u00ad creases were registered in China and the USA. Overall, leas\u00ad ing accounted for 31.8 % and credit financing for 68.2 % of new business.\n\nBusiness with pre\u00adowned vehicles also developed positively, with the number of new contracts signed up by 1.4 %. In total, 411,520 new credit financing and leasing contracts for pre\u00adowned BMW and MINI brand vehicles were signed dur\u00ad ing the year under report (2020: 405,713 contracts).\n\nThe total volume of new credit financing and leasing con\u00ad tracts concluded with retail customers during the 12\u00admonth period amounted to \u20ac 63,414 million, significantly up on the previous year (2020: \u20ac 57,200 million; + 10.9 %).\n\nThe share of new BMW Group vehicles either leased or fi\u00ad nanced by the Financial Services segment stood at 50.5 % 1 (2020: 49.8 %; + 0.7 percentage points).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the contract portfolio with retail cus\u00ad tomers comprised 5,577,011 contracts and was therefore at a similar level to one year earlier (2020: 5,591,799 contracts; - 0.3 %). In regional terms, China grew at the fastest rate, registering a 9.0 % year\u00adon\u00adyear increase. The Asia / Pacific region finished at a similar level to the previous year (+0.3 %). By contrast, the Americas (- 2.2 %), the EU Bank 2 (- 1.7 %) and the Europe / Middle East / Africa regions (- 1.7 %) all reg\u00ad istered slight contract portfolio decreases.\n\n## CONTRACT PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT WITH RETAIL CUSTOMERS\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main reason for the increase was the improved risk profile throughout the year - in par\u00ad ticular thanks to better remarketing outcomes and lower ex\u00ad penses for credit risk allowances.\n\nThe RoE in 2021 was therefore in line with the revised fore\u00ad cast of between 20 and 23 %. Originally, an RoE within a range of 12 to 15 % was predicted for 2021 in the BMW Group Report 2020.\n\n## Other Entities segment / Eliminations\n\nThe Other Entities segment recorded a profit before tax of \u20ac 531 million in the financial year under report (2020: loss before tax of \u20ac 235 million). The turnaround was primarily attributable  to  the  improvement  in  other  financial  result, which benefited from the recognition of fair value measure\u00ad ment gains on interest rate hedges entered into with match\u00ad ing maturities in conjunction with the refinancing of Financial Services business in a period of rising rather than falling in\u00ad terest rates.\n\nEliminations gave rise to a loss before tax of \u20ac 257 million (2020: profit before tax of \u20ac 910 million). The deterioration here reflected the higher volume of leasing\u00adbusiness\u00adrelated eliminations required, primarily due to the year\u00adon\u00adyear  in\u00ad crease in new leasing business, both in terms of sales vol\u00ad ume and contract values.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\n## BMW GROUP NEW VEHICLES FINANCED OR LEASED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CONTRACT PORTFOLIO RETAIL CUSTOMER FINANCING OF FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnder the brand name Alphabet, the Financial Services seg\u00ad ment's fleet management business primarily offers leasing and financing arrangements as well as specialist services to commercial customers. At 31 December 2021, the contract portfolio stood at 696,393 contracts (2020: 704,977 con\u00ad tracts;  - 1.2 %).\n\n## Dealership financing significantly lower\n\nThe dealership financing line of business was impacted by a significant reduction in vehicle inventories held by dealer\u00ad ships at the end of the year, mainly due to constraints on new vehicle production caused by semiconductor shortages on the one hand and the high demand for new and pre\u00ad owned vehicles on the other. As a result, the volume of deal\u00ad ership financing decreased significantly by 19.0 % to \u20ac 13,149 million at 31 December 2021 (2020: \u20ac 16,241 million).\n\n## Results of operations of the Financial Services segment\n\nFinancial Services segment revenues increased to \u20ac 32,867 million (2020: \u20ac 30,044 million; +9.4 %), driven in particular  by  the  higher  level  of  revenues  generated  with end\u00adof\u00adcontract business on the back of ongoing favourable conditions on pre\u00adowned vehicle markets. Segment cost of sales  went  up  by  \u20ac  791 million  (2020:  \u20ac  26,958  million; +2.9 %), mainly due to increased costs associated with the sale of returned lease vehicles.\n\nAt the same time, the remarketing values of those vehicles also surged, with a corresponding positive impact on earn\u00ad ings. Moreover, segment earnings benefited from the un\u00ad changed low level of allowances required to be recognised for credit risks. This contrasts with the situation one year ear\u00ad lier, when earnings were impacted by additional risk provi\u00ad sioning expenses for credit and residual value risks in light of the coronavirus pandemic.",

The comments on the BMW Group and the Au\u00ad tomotive  segment  provided  in  earlier  sections  apply  to BMW AG, unless presented differently in the following sec\u00ad tion. The Financial Statements of BMW AG are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the relevant supplementary provisions con\u00ad tained in the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe key financial performance indicator for BMW AG is the dividend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to net profit for the year of the BMW Group in accordance with IFRS). The key non\u00adfi\u00ad nancial performance indicators are essentially identical and concurrent  with  those  of  the  BMW Group.  These  are  de\u00ad scribed in detail in the \u2197 Financial Performance section of the Combined Management Report.\n\nDifferences in accounting treatments based on HGB (used for the Company Financial Statements) and IFRS (used for the Group Financial Statements) are mainly to be found in connection with the capitalisation of intangible assets, the creation of valuation units, the recognition and measure\u00ad ment of financial instruments and provisions as well as the recognition of deferred tax assets. Differences also arise in the presentation of assets and liabilities and of items in the income statement.\n\n## Business environment and review of operations\n\nThe general and sector\u00adspecific environment of BMW AG is essentially the same as that of the BMW Group and is de\u00ad scribed in the \u2197 Financial Performance section of the Combined Management Report.\n\nBMW AG develops, manufactures and sells automobiles and motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories manu\u00ad factured in\u00adhouse, by foreign subsidiaries and by external suppliers, and performs services related to these products. Sales activities are conducted primarily through branches, subsidiaries, independent dealerships and importers. Bene\u00ad fiting mainly from the diminishing impact of the coronavirus pandemic, automobile deliveries increased by 187,648 units to 2,437,591 units in the financial year 2021. This figure in\u00ad cludes 674,995 units relating to series sets supplied to the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, an increase of 76,142 units over the previous year.\n\nAt 31 December  2021, BMW AG employed a workforce of 83,308 people (31 December 2020: 84,668 people).\n\nDespite the global challenges driven by semiconductor sup\u00ad ply shortages and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, BMW AG can be satisfied with the course of business in the financial year 2021.\n\nThe BMW Group's results of operations, financial position and net assets of the financial year 2021 are indicative of its solid  financial  condition.  Business  developed  in  line  with management expectations. This assessment also takes into account events after the end of the reporting period.",

In geographical terms,  the  greater  part  of  the  increase  was  generated in the USA, China and Rest of Europe. Revenues totalled \u20ac 88,526 million (2020: \u20ac 75,040 million), of which Group internal  revenues  accounted  for  \u20ac  60,373 million  (2020: \u20ac 49,348 million) or 68.2 % (2020: 65.8 %).\n\nCost of sales went up by 13.4 % to \u20ac 72,283 million, mostly due to sales volume growth.\n\nGross profit rose by \u20ac 4,929 million to \u20ac 16,243 million.\n\nOverall, selling expenses decreased slightly and general ad\u00ad ministrative expenses increased significantly.\n\nA  large  proportion  of  the  research  and  development  ex\u00ad penses incurred in 2021 are related to new vehicle models (including the all\u00adelectric BMW iX and BMW i4 models and the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer) as well as to the devel\u00ad opment of digital products, automated driving and new ar\u00ad\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nchitectures. Research and development expenses rose by 19.6 % year\u00adon\u00adyear, reflecting the increase in vehicle and module  production  start\u00adup  activities  as  the  BMW Group continues its electric offensive.\n\nOther operating income increased to \u20ac 2,199 million (2020: \u20ac 1,237 million), primarily due to income arising on the partial reversal of the provision relating to EU Commission antitrust proceedings.\n\nOther operating expenses increased slightly to \u20ac 1,460 mil\u00ad lion (2020: \u20ac 1,250 million) and, as in the previous year, com\u00ad prised mainly expenses from financing transactions and ad\u00ad ditions to other provisions.\n\nIncome from profit transfer agreements with Group com\u00ad panies, reported in the line item Result on investments, was similar to one year earlier.\n\nThe financial result deteriorated by \u20ac 146 million, mainly due to lower income from designated plan assets offset against pension obligations.\n\nThe expense for income taxes related primarily to current tax for the financial year 2021.\n\nAfter deducting the expense for taxes, the Company reports a net profit of \u20ac 4,910 million, compared to \u20ac 1,702 million in the previous year.\n\nSubject to the shareholders' approval of the appropriation of results at the Annual General Meeting, the unappropriated profit available for distribution amounts to \u20ac 3,827 million (2020: \u20ac 1,253 million). As a percentage of Group net profit, the dividend corresponds to a payout ratio of 30.7 % (2020: 32.5 %), which is therefore within the forecasted target range of 30 % to 40 %.\n\nFinancial Performance",

Up to the financial year 2021, the payout ratio was defined as the un\u00ad appropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation  to  the  Group  net  profit  in  accordance  with  IFRS (2021: 30.7 %).\n\nDue to its significance in the Group and its close ties with Group companies, expectations for BMW AG with respect to its non\u00adfinancial performance indicators correspond largely to the BMW Group's outlook. This is described in detail in the \u2197 Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management section of the Combined Management Report.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesell\u00ad schaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has issued an unqualified  audit  opinion  on  the  financial  statements  of BMW AG, of which the balance sheet and the income state\u00ad ment are presented here. The BMW AG financial statements for the financial year 2021 will be submitted to the operator of the electronic version of the German Federal Gazette and can be obtained via the Company Register website. These financial statements are available on the BMW Group's web\u00ad site at \u2197 www.bmwgroup.com / ir .\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nThe  increase  in  other  receivables  and  other  assets  to \u20ac 4,071 million (2020: \u20ac 3,849 million) was mainly attributa\u00ad ble to higher tax receivables. The decrease in financial mar\u00ad ket receivables had an offsetting effect.\n\nEquity increased by \u20ac 3,762 million to \u20ac 18,927 million due to the  higher  level  of  unappropriated  profit  reported,  which was, in turn, attributable to the combined effect of the previ\u00ad ous year's lower dividend payout and the higher transfer to other revenue reserves as well as the issue of shares of pre\u00ad ferred stock in conjunction with the Employee Share Pro\u00ad gramme in 2021. The equity ratio changed from 26.3 % to 29.3 %.\n\nIn order to secure pension obligations, cash funds totalling \u20ac 1,081 million were transferred to BMW Trust e. V., Munich, in conjunction with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA), to be invested in plan assets. Plan assets are offset against the related guaranteed obligations. The resulting surplus of assets over liabilities is reported in the BMW AG balance sheet on the line item Surplus of pension and similar plan assets over liabilities.\n\nProvisions  for  pensions  increased  from  \u20ac  229  million  to \u20ac 422 million, after offsetting of pension plan assets against pension obligations.\n\nOther provisions decreased slightly from \u20ac 10,093 million to \u20ac 9,995 million due to the utilisation and partial reversal of the provision relating to EU Commission antitrust proceed\u00ad ings. This was mainly offset by additions to personnel\u00adrelat\u00ad ed provisions and provisions for statutory and non\u00adstatutory warranty and product guarantee obligations.\n\nLiabilities  to  subsidiaries  increased  to  \u20ac  24,462  million (2020: \u20ac  23,404  million), mainly in connection with intra\u00ad group refinancing.\n\nDeferred income increased by \u20ac 264 million to \u20ac 3,879 mil\u00ad lion and included primarily amounts for services still to be performed relating to service and maintenance contracts.\n\nLiquidity within the BMW Group is ensured by means of a li\u00ad quidity concept applied uniformly across the Group. This in\u00ad volves concentrating a significant part of the Group's liquid\u00ad ity at the level of BMW AG. An important instrument in this context is the cash pool based at BMW AG. The liquidity pos\u00ad ition reported by BMW AG therefore reflects the global activ\u00ad ities of BMW AG and other Group companies.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased by \u20ac 2,002 million to \u20ac 8,824 million, mainly due to surpluses from operating ac\u00ad tivities. Cash outflows for investments in fixed assets had an offsetting effect.\n\n## Risks and opportunities\n\nBMW AG's  performance  is  essentially  dependent  on  the same  set  of  risks  and  opportunities  that  affect  the BMW Group and which are described in detail in the \u2197 Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management chapter of the Combined Man\u00ad agement Report. As a general rule, BMW AG participates in the risks entered into by Group companies in proportion to the respective shareholding percentage. At the same time, the result on investments has a significant impact on the earnings of BMW AG.\n\nBMW AG is integrated in the Group\u00adwide risk management system and internal control system of the BMW Group. Fur\u00ad ther information is provided in the \u2197 Internal Control System chap\u00ad ter of the Combined Management Report.\n\n## Outlook\n\nFor the financial year 2022, BMW AG expects an unchanged dividend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to the Group net profit at\u00ad tributable to shareholders of BMW AG in accordance with",

        "page_content": "across its entire value chain by 2050, we welcome initiatives that serve this objective. For this reason, we have set our\u00ad selves specific targets and report systematically each year on the actual levels achieved.\n\nIn the coming years, the significant growth in electric mobility will mean that - depending on the energy mix - the majority of carbon emissions will be generated in particular within the up\u00ad stream value chain rather than in the use phase.  Without the anticipated set of measures, emissions gene rated within the BMW Group supply chain would already  exceed direct carbon emissions in the use phase prior to 2030. \u2197 Strategy /Supplier net\u00ad work /Carbon emissions Accordingly, the BMW Group is taking a ho\u00ad listic approach to achieving its sustainability\u00adrelated targets and is committed to considering carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of the vehicles it produces. \u2197 Carbon Emissions and Pollutants Currently, however, for the purpose of assessing car\u00ad bon emissions, the EU taxonomy focuses exclusively on reduc\u00ad ing emissions in the use phase that are attributable to locally emissions\u00adfree drive systems, an approach which also ignores the emissions indirectly attributable to the supply of energy. Moreover, the taxonomy only reflects the impact of decarbon\u00ad isation measures in production to the extent that they serve to manufacture taxonomy\u00adaligned products. However, increasing the energy efficiency of paint shop processes also reduces carbon emissions when a conventionally powered vehicle is painted.\n\nEU Taxonomy\n\n## EU TAXONOMY\n\nWithin the framework of the EU Green Deal and the Action Plan 'Financing Sustainable Growth', the EU taxonomy is a cornerstone of the EU's aspiration to become climate\u00adneu\u00ad tral by 2050. Its key objectives are to create transparency for capital market participants and to channel capital flows to\u00ad wards sustainable economic activities.\n\nThe  EU  taxonomy  is  a  classification  system  that  defines economic activities as environmentally sustainable based on predetermined criteria. Environmental sustainability is as\u00ad certained in three steps.\n\nEssentially, an economic activity can only be classified as sustainable if it makes a substantial contribution to one of the following six environmental objectives:\n\n- 1) Climate change mitigation\n- 2)  Climate change adaptation\n- 3)   The sustainable use and protection of water and mar ine  resources\n- 4)  The transition to a circular economy\n- 5)   Pollution prevention and control\n- 6)   The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nSubstantial contribution depends on the extent to which the economic  activity  in  question  fulfils  so\u00adcalled  technical screening criteria. No other environmental objective may be\n\nsignificantly harmed, and minimum protection criteria for oc\u00ad cupational safety and human rights must also be met.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation was published in July 2020. The Delegated Act on the first two environmental objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, and  the  delegated  regulation  on  reporting  requirements (Art icle 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation) came into force at the end of December 2021 * . In addition, the EU Commission published an initial FAQ document in December 2021 and a second FAQ document in early February 2022 to explain ap\u00ad plication issues relevant for the first year of reporting. On the basis of the phased introduction of the EU taxonomy in the Delegated Acts, in 2021 companies such as the BMW Group are required to report the taxonomy\u00adeligible proportion of revenues, capital expenditures and operational expenditures for the first two environmental objectives. From the reporting years 2022 and 2023 onwards, the reporting requirements are  to  be  successively  expanded  to  include  the  taxono\u00ad my\u00adaligned proportion of revenues, capital and operational expenditures and to all environmental objectives.\n\n## Our understanding of sustainability\n\nThe BMW Group supports the overarching aim of the EU Taxonomy Regulation to promote the private financing of sustainable economic activities in order to make Europe the world's first climate\u00adneutral continent by 2050. As a com\u00ad pany aspiring to establish a climate\u00adneutral business model",

They will subsequently increase due to the growing share of zero\u00ademissions vehicles, the develop\u00ad ment and production methods used, and potentially contri\u00ad butions made to other environmental objectives as yet to be defined. Due to the high level of investment in the trans\u00ad formation of our business activities, for example in the elec\u00ad trification of our vehicles and research into alternative drive systems, these economic activities have the potential to be\u00ad come  taxonomy\u00adaligned  over  time.  Overall,  we  anticipate that the proportion of taxonomy\u00adaligned economic activities will steadily rise as a result of the increasing electrification of our product portfolio.\n\nBy 2025 the share of electrified automobiles in total Group deliveries is expected to rise to at least 30 %. Over the next decade, we expect that some ten million of our all\u00adelectric vehicles will be on the roads. Therefore, by 2030, at least every second automobile delivered by the BMW Group will be an all\u00adelectric model.\n\nEU Taxonomy\n\n## Explanatory comments on reporting procedures\n\nFor the reporting year 2021, the currently applicable simplifi\u00ad cation rules only require reporting on taxonomy eligibility in relation to the environmental objections of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. Taxonomy eligi\u00ad bility is an indicator of the environmental sustainability po\u00ad tential of an economic activity based on the selective re\u00ad quirements of the EU taxonomy.

Our aspiration is to successively make all of the BMW Group's economic ac\u00ad tivities more sustainable.\n\nAn economic activity is taxonomy\u00adeligible if it is described in the Delegated Acts relating to the six environmental objec\u00ad tives, regardless of whether that economic activity meets all of the technical screening criteria stipulated in those Dele\u00ad gated Acts.

Only taxonomy\u00adeligible revenues, ca p\u00ad ital expenditure, and operational expenditure as listed for Environmental Objective 1 ('Climate change mitigation') are disclosed, given that taxonomy\u00adeligible revenues, capital ex\u00ad penditure  and  operational  expenditure  for  Environmental Objective 2 ('Climate change adaptation') are a subset of the values for Environmental Objective 1 ('Climate change mitigation'). This approach avoids double counting of re v\u00ad enues,  capital  expenditure  and  operational  expenditure when determining the KPI in the numerator across multiple economic activities.\n\nFurther information on revenues is provided in \u2197 note 7 to the Group Financial Statements. Revenues are calculated in ac\u00ad cordance  with  Article  2(5)  of  Directive  2013 / 34 / EU.  Re\u00ad venues comprise revenue and income items recognised in accordance with IAS 1.82(a), as amended by Commission\n\nRegulation (EC) No. 1126 / 2008. Revenues relating to the sale of parts and components (e. g. after\u00adsales business ex\u00ad cluding the provision of repair services) and the supply of production components to BBA and third parties, insurance premiums, and interest income on deposit\u00adtaking and credit business were not included, as these economic activities are not classified as taxonomy\u00adeligible.\n\nIn the case of the disclosures for capital expenditure , ref\u00ad erence is made to \u2197 note 21 and \u2197 note 22 to the Group Finan\u00ad cial Statements.

In accordance with the definition of cap\u00ad ital expenditure provided in Annex I of the Delegated Regu\u00ad lation (EU) 2021 / 2178, the KPI figure used for taxonomy purposes comprises additions to intangible assets, in par\u00ad ticular capitalised development costs, additions to property, plant and equipment as well as right\u00adof\u00aduse assets in ac\u00ad cordance with IFRS 16, and leased\u00adout products.

In line with the Group's performance management, the outlook covers a period of one year. Risks and opportunities are managed on the basis of a two\u00adyear assessment period. Disclosures relating to risk and opportunity management therefore ad\u00ad dress a period of two years.\n\nThe  continuous  forecasting  process  applied  within  the BMW Group ensures that it is constantly ready to take ad\u00ad vantage of opportunities as they arise, but also to react ap\u00ad propriately to any unexpected risks. The principal risks and opportunities are described in detail in the Risk and Oppor\u00ad tunity Management section. Actual outcomes may deviate from the outlook due to unexpected events.\n\nIt is not yet possible to accurately assess the full impact of the war in Ukraine, as the situation remains highly volatile, making it extremely difficult to forecast macroeconomic de\u00ad velopments and the likely performance of international auto\u00ad mobile markets in the financial year 2022 \u2197 Forecast assumptions .\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nAccording to IMF projections in January, the global economy will continue to grow in 2022, less strongly than in the previ\u00ad ous year, and reach a level of around 4.0 %. Risks definitely persist, however, first and foremost due to the further course of the war in Ukraine, the estimated impact of which has been taken into account in the current economic forecasts only  rudimentarily. High inflation is likely to lead to interest rate increases in some countries and weaken demand to some extent. New virus variants, pandemic\u00adrelated restric\u00ad tions or prolonged supply bottlenecks could slow the pace of economic growth. Further information on political and global economic risks is also available in the section \u2197 Risk and Oppor\u00ad tunity Management .\n\nIn the Eurozone, GDP growth is projected to be around 3.0 % in 2022. At 2.1 %, the growth rate in Germany is expected to be slightly lower than one year earlier and similar figures are predicted  for  France  (+2.8 %),  Italy  (+3.1 %)  and  Spain (+4.6 %).\n\nThe UK economy is projected to grow by 3.5 % in 2022 de\u00ad spite labour shortages and continued supply bottlenecks.\n\nA growth rate of 3.2 % is projected for the USA in 2022, which is still positive, although not as strong as in the previ\u00ad ous year. The stimulus and infrastructure packages adopted by the US Administration are likely to provide support for the economy.\n\nAfter strong growth in the previous year, momentum in China is expected to drop slightly in 2022. A growth rate of 5.1 % is therefore projected for the 12\u00admonth period.\n\nAfter a slight recovery in the year under report, the pace of growth in Japan is projected to increase moderately in 2022 (+2.3 %).\n\n## Currency markets and international interest rate environment\n\nCurrencies of particular importance for the international op\u00ad erations of the BMW Group are the Chinese renminbi, the British pound, the US dollar and the Japanese yen.\n\nWhereas the ECB is likely to keep persevering with its expan\u00ad sionary monetary policy in 2022, the US Federal Reserve has announced its intention to tighten its policy in light of high inflation and the USA's strong economic recovery and to raise interest rates during the first half of 2022. Compared with the previous year, the US dollar is therefore likely to ap\u00ad preciate against the euro.\n\nFollowing the gain in value of the British pound against the euro in 2021 and the tighter monetary policy predicted in the UK over the 12\u00admonth period, combined with moderate inter\u00ad est rate hikes, a further slight appreciation of the currency is expected in 2022.",

        "page_content": "Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management\n\nThe central bank in Japan is unlikely to change its highly ex\u00ad pansionary monetary policy in 2022. The yen is therefore likely to depreciate slightly against the euro.\n\nAfter appreciating against the euro in 2021, the Chinese ren\u00ad minbi is expected to lose in value slightly in the course of 2022, due to the Chinese central bank's recent decision to ease monetary policy with a view to ensuring that the greater demand for financing can be met.\n\nThe Russian rouble has depreciated significantly, especially since the beginning of the military conflict with Ukraine. The currencies of emerging market countries such as Brazil and India are likely to remain under pressure against the US dol\u00ad lar and the euro in 2022, mainly due to the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n## International automobile markets\n\nSupply bottlenecks are likely to continue having a dampen\u00ad ing  impact  on  automobile  markets  in  2022.  The  war  in Ukraine will significantly exacerbate the current supply bot\u00ad tlenecks. The forecasts are generally based on the assump\u00ad tion that the supply bottlenecks will be overcome in the sec\u00ad ond half of 2022. Registration figures worldwide are expected to grow at a slightly faster rate than in the previous year (ap\u00ad proximately  77  million  units;  +4 %).  However,  due  to  the marked weakness of recent years, absolute registration fig\u00ad ures remain well below normal levels.\n\nEurope's automobile markets are expected to grow moder\u00ad ately in 2022 (12.5 million units; +6 %).\n\nThe trend is similar in the USA, with the market expected to grow by 6 % to 15.9 million units in 2022. However, this is still below the pre\u00adcoronavirus crisis level.\n\nIn China, on the other hand, the automobile market as a whole is expected to remain flat, reflecting the slowdown in\n\neconomic momentum. After the slight recovery in 2021, pas\u00ad senger vehicle registrations are therefore expected to be in the region of 21.2 million units in 2022, just 1 % up on the previous year.\n\nThe Japanese automobile market is currently predicted to expand slightly in 2022 (4.4 million units; +2 %).\n\nRegistration figures on international automobile markets are expected to develop as follows in 2022:\n\n## INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOBILE MARKETS\n\n| Change  in Registrations %   |\n|------------------------------|\n| Europe + 6                   |\n| thereof Germany + 6          |\n| thereof France + 4           |\n| thereof Italy + 4            |\n| thereof Spain + 6            |\n| thereof UK + 12              |\n| USA + 6                      |\n| China + 1                    |\n| Japan + 2                    |\n| Total + 4                    |\n\n## International motorcycle markets\n\nThe BMW Group expects, subject to the further development in Ukraine, the world's motorcycle markets in the 250 cc plus class to remain stable in 2022, with volumes generally re\u00ad maining at the previous year's level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe impact of the war in Ukraine, the limited availability of vehicle components, the further course of the coronavirus pandemic, and macroeconomic factors will continue to influ\u00ad ence the performance of motorcycles markets in 2022.\n\n## Expected consequences for the BMW Group\n\nFuture developments on international automobile markets have a direct impact on the BMW Group. The challenging market environment, the supply situation for vehicle compo\u00ad nents, the coronavirus pandemic and further developments in the Ukraine conflict are currently the factors most likely to have a significant impact on business performance. Flexible coordination between the Group's sales and production net\u00ad works will also help cushion the impact of unforeseeable de\u00ad velopments in individual regions. \u2197 Risk and Opportunity Management\n\n## Assumptions used in the outlook\n\nBoth the Outlook and the Risk and Opportunity Manage\u00ad ment sections of this report contain forward\u00adlooking state\u00ad ments based on the BMW Group's expectations and assess\u00ad ments and may be influenced by unforeseeable events. As a result, actual outcomes can deviate either positively or neg\u00ad atively from the expectations described below, due to chang\u00ad es in the political and economic environment as well as other factors. \u2197 Risk and Opportunity Management\n\nThe following outlook covers a forecast period of one year and is based on the composition of the BMW Group during that time. For this reason, the outlook also includes the im\u00ad pact of fully consolidating BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang,  (BMW  Brilliance).  On  11  February  2022,  the BMW Group  increased  its  shareholding  in  the  BMW  Bril\u00ad liance joint venture from 50 % to 75 %*. The full consolida\u00ad tion of BMW Brilliance with effect from that date has a signif\u00ad icant impact on some of the BMW Group's key performance indicators.",

        "page_content": "Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management\n\nThe outlook takes account of all information available at the time of reporting and which could have an impact on the overall course of business of the Group. The expectations contained in the outlook are based on the BMW Group's forecast for 2022 and reflect its most recent status. The ba\u00ad sis for the preparation of and the principal assumptions used in the forecasts - which consider the consensual opinions of leading organisations, such as economic research institutes and banks - are set out below. The BMW Group's outlook takes account of these assumptions.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is no longer currently expected to have a significant impact on the results of operations, finan\u00ad cial and net assets position of BMW AG and the Group as a whole.\n\nHowever, international demand for semiconductors is still predicted to remain high, causing the supply situation to re\u00ad main tight. As in the financial year 2021, the risk of supply bottlenecks affecting the availability of the semiconductor components required for production persists and the situa\u00ad tion is not expected to ease before the second half of 2022.\n\nThe dual impact of an economic upturn and supply bottle\u00ad necks caused raw materials prices to rise sharply in 2021. The BMW Group expects the overall situation on raw mate\u00ad rials and energy markets to remain tense in the foreseeable future and has already taken the initial impact of the pre\u00ad vailing situation into account in its outlook for the financial year 2022.\n\nMoreover, the war in Ukraine is having a substantial effect on that country's automotive supply industry, with supply restric\u00ad tions resulting in production schedule adjustments and / or interruptions at a number of BMW Group plants.\n\nThe outlook does not factor in the following:\n\n- - A significant tightening of sanctions against Russia or a change in the interpretation of existing sanctions\n- - An escalation of the conflict outside Ukraine\n- - Additional major price hikes for energy and raw materi\u00ad als, including rises triggered by the war in Ukraine and / or the related sanctions\n\nRegardless of these uncertainties, however, the situation re\u00ad mains highly volatile, making it very difficult to accurately forecast outcomes for the financial year 2022. Other possible longer\u00adterm effects of the war in Ukraine cannot be estimat\u00ad ed at the present time and are therefore not taken into ac\u00ad count in the outlook.\n\n## Outlook for the BMW Group - key performance indicators\n\nPrior to the outbreak of war in Ukraine, the BMW Group was set to forecast slight year\u00adon\u00adyear growth in deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls\u00adRoyce brand vehicles for the Automo\u00ad tive segment 1 . However, due to the production schedule ad\u00ad justments and interruptions described above that have been triggered by the war in Ukraine, it now predicts deliveries to remain at previous year's level.\n\nThe BMW Group expects to achieve its target of slightly cut\u00ad ting the carbon emissions generated by its EU new vehicle fleet, driven in particular by the significantly growing share of electrified automobiles in total deliveries.\n\nWithout the impact of the war in Ukraine, carbon emissions per vehicle produced would have been predicted to decline moderately 2 . However, in light of the likely adverse impact of production  schedule  adjustments  and  interruptions  trig\u00ad gered by the war in Ukraine, the scale of reduction is now only expected to be slight.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExcluding the impact of the full consolidation of BMW Bril\u00ad liance and the war in Ukraine, the Automotive segment EBIT margin had been expected to finish within a target range of between 8 and 10 %.\n\nAlthough, as described above, the BMW Group had been set to forecast sales volume growth, the EBIT margin had never\u00ad theless been expected to be lower year\u00adon\u00adyear due to the absence of various positive effects that had benefited the fi\u00ad nancial year 2021, such as the partial reversal of the provi\u00ad sion  relating  to  the  concluded  antitrust  proceedings,  the remeasurement gains arising on the modernisation of the pension plan, and the highly favourable risk situation in the leasing line of business. The full consolidation of BMW Bril\u00ad liance would have increased segment revenues and EBIT sharply, but due to consolidation effects, no significant im\u00ad pact on the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment was ex\u00ad pected for the financial year 2022 and the figure would have been likely to remain between 8 and 10 %. However, in light of the probable adverse impact of production schedule ad\u00ad justments and interruptions triggered by the war in Ukraine, an EBIT margin of between 7 and 9 % is now thought to be more realistic.\n\nBased on the newly adopted methodology, RoCE for the Au\u00ad tomotive segment would have been forecast at between 19 and 24 %, reflecting the lower level of earnings otherwise expected without the increase in the stake in BMW Brilliance and the impact of the war in Ukraine. However, the addition\u00ad al net assets identified in conjunction with the increased stake in BMW Brilliance plus fair value adjustments arising on the purchase price allocation have the twin effect of in\u00ad creasing capital employed. In combination with elimination effects on earnings in 2022, the targeted range for RoCE would therefore have been between 15 and 20 %. However, in light of the adverse impact of production schedule adjust\u00ad",

The EBIT margin is predicted to finish within a range of between 8 and 10 % and, based on the revised methodol\u00ad ogy, the segment RoCE within a range of 19 and 24 %. Key performance indicators for the Motorcycles segment will only be marginally affected by the full consolidation of BMW Bril\u00ad liance and are not currently expected to be substantially im\u00ad pacted by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe RoE in the Financial Services segment is predicted to finish within a range of between 14 and 17 %. Compared with the financial year 2021, it has been assumed that the highly favourable results from remarketing lease returns, combined with an easing of the supply situation for semiconductors during the second half of the year, will return to a normal lev\u00ad el. The full consolidation of BMW Brilliance will not impact the  Financial  Services  segment,  as  the  companies  held jointly with BMW Brilliance that are attributable to this seg\u00ad ment have already been reported on a fully consolidated ba\u00ad sis due to the segment's majority shareholdings in the enti\u00ad ties concerned. Likewise, no significant impact is currently expected from the war in Ukraine.\n\nExcluding the impact of the full consolidation of BMW Bril\u00ad liance, Group profit before tax would have decreased signifi\u00ad cantly. Without the impact of the war in Ukraine, sales vol\u00ad umes would have been expected to develop positively over the forecast period. However, this volume growth would not have been sufficient to compensate for the previous year's effects, such as the partial reversal of the provision relating to the concluded antitrust proceedings, the remeasurement gains arising on the modernisation of the pension plan, and the highly favourable risk situation within the credit and leas\u00ad ing lines of business. Nonetheless, including the impact of the full consolidation of BMW Brilliance, Group profit before\n\ntax is set to increase significantly over the forecast period, mainly reflecting BMW Brilliance's additional contribution to the Automotive segment's operating profit as well as the remeasurement of the at\u00adequity investment previously re\u00ad corded, with a positive effect of approximately \u20ac 7 to \u20ac 8 bil\u00ad lion to be recognised within the financial result. These ef\u00ad fects would more than compensate for the elimination of the previous at\u00adequity result of BMW Brilliance in the financial result and the negative impact of consolidated adjustments arising on full consolidation. Even taking into account the negative impact of production schedule adjustments and in\u00ad terruptions triggered by the war in Ukraine, Group profit is expected to increase significantly.\n\nThe share of women in management functions within the BMW Group is expected to rise slightly, irrespective of the Group's increased stake in BMW Brilliance.\n\nWithout taking the full consolidation of BMW Brilliance into account,  the  targets  described  above  would  have  been achieved with only a slight rise in the overall number of em\u00ad ployees. However, the increase in the stake in BMW Bril\u00ad liance and the full consolidation of that entity will cause the number of employees to rise significantly.\n\nThe BMW Group's actual business performance may also deviate from current expectations due to the risks and op\u00ad portunities discussed below in the section on \u2197 Risk and Oppor\u00ad tunity Management .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Against this backdrop, it consciously takes well\u00adcalculated risks and makes full use of any oppor\u00ad tunities that present themselves.\n\nThe management of risks and opportunities is essential in order to respond appropriately to any changes that occur in political, economic, ecological, social, technological or legal conditions. The BMW Group has put a comprehensive risk management system in place to effectively manage these risks as they arise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe aim of the risk management system is to identify, as\u00ad sess and proactively manage any risks that could threaten the attainment of the Group's corporate targets. As part of that process, any individual or cumulative risks capable of posing a threat to the profitability of the business are both monitored and managed.\n\nAll opportunities and risks that are expected to materialise have already been addressed in the Outlook Report. The fol\u00ad lowing sections focus on potential future developments or events that could result in a positive (opportunity) or a nega\u00ad tive (risk) deviation from the outlook for the BMW Group.\n\nAs a general rule, the time horizon considered covers the current and the following financial year. Potential short\u00adterm effects of climate change are taken into account.\n\nMedium\u00ad to long\u00adterm risks in connection with the climate change are described in the section \u2197 Climate\u00adrelated opportunities and risks .\n\nWith effect from 11 February 2022, the BMW Brilliance Auto\u00ad motive Ltd. (BMW Brilliance) joint venture is fully consolidat\u00ad ed in the Group Financial Statements. If the full consolida\u00ad tion of BMW Brilliance from that date is expected to result in a different classification of individual risk categories, such changes are indicated separately in this Risk Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overall Risk and Opportunity Situation\n\nThe assessment of the overall risk situation is based on a consolidated view of all significant individual risks to which the BMW Group is exposed. The BMW Group's overall expo\u00ad sure to risk, including the impact of integrating BMW Bril\u00ad liance, has increased moderately compared with the previ\u00ad ous year. A prolonged military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and a worsening of the coronavirus pandemic could have a further negative impact on the global economy and hold down sales volume. At the same time, considerable un\u00ad certainties remain in the form of potential bottlenecks along the  entire  supply  chain,  particularly  for  semiconductors. However, if the effect of these issues were to prove less se\u00ad vere in 2022 than currently expected, opportunities could arise that could benefit both revenues and earnings.\n\nThe Management and the Supervisory Board do not see any threat to the BMW Group's status as a going concern. Simi\u00ad lar  to  one  year  earlier,  the  current  set  of  risks  to  the BMW Group are considered to be manageable. If these risks - or opportunities - were to materialise, they could have an impact on underlying key performance indicators, thus caus\u00ad ing deviations from the outlook. Regardless of the full con\u00ad solidation of BMW Brilliance, the BMW Group's financial re\u00ad sources are stable and liquidity requirements are currently covered by existing liquidity as well as the various financing instruments available.\n\nIn addition to the risks described below, unforeseen events could have a negative impact on business operations and hence on the BMW Group's results of operations, financial position and net assets as well as on its reputation.",

The various BMW Group divisions are represented by Network Representatives. The responsibilities and tasks of the centralised risk management function and the Net\u00ad work Representatives are clearly documented and accepted. Risks pertaining to BMW Brilliance are incorporated in this Risk Report on the basis of the assessment made by the centralised risk management function. In future, BMW Bril\u00ad liance will also be integrated in the risk management net\u00ad work. Significant risks reported from within the network are firstly presented for review to the Risk Management Steering Committee, which is chaired by Group Controlling. After they have been reviewed, any significant risks are reported to\n\nboth the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee.\n\nOther functions such as Compliance and Human Rights and the Internal Control System serve as key interfaces to the risk management system. In its capacity as an independent con\u00ad trol body, Corporate Audit reviews the risk management sys\u00ad tem established by the Board of Management on an annual basis.\n\nAccording  to  Group\u00adwide  guidelines,  every  employee  and manager has a duty to report risks via the relevant reporting channels. The key elements of an appropriate risk culture are embedded in the BMW Group's core values, the BMW Group Risk Management Policy and the BMW Group Risk Manage\u00ad\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE BMW GROUP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nment Guidelines as well as in the Group's overall risk strat\u00ad egy. New information and requirements are continuously in\u00ad corporated in the BMW Group's risk management system, thereby  ensuring  its  ongoing  development.  Training  pro\u00ad grammes and informational events are regularly conducted throughout the BMW Group, particularly within the risk man\u00ad agement network.\n\nThe risk management process is applicable across the entire Group and comprises the early identification, analysis and measurement of risks, the coordinated use of appropriate risk management tools and the monitoring and assessment of the measures taken.",

        "page_content": "Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management\n\n## Risk Measurement\n\nThe BMW Group utilises standardised methods to assess risks. All significant risks are measured using value\u00adat\u00adrisk models and assessed on the basis of uniform loss distribu\u00ad tion metrics, thereby enabling better comparability of risks for both internal and external reporting purposes. The overall impact of the risks on the results of operations, financial and net assets position is referred to in the following sections uniformly as 'earnings impact'.\n\nRisks are measured net of any risk mitigation measures that are already taking effect (net basis).\n\nRisks are classified according to the risk amount (average earnings impact, taking into account the probability of occur\u00ad rence). The earnings impact may be significantly higher if the risk actually materialises (worst\u00adcase scenario).\n\nIn light of the continued growth of the business and the as\u00ad sociated risks, the value limits used in the Annual Report since 2013 have been revised.\n\nThe following ranges apply for the purpose of classifying the risk amount:\n\n| Class            | Previous risk amount range   | New risk amount range   |\n|------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u20ac 0 - 50 million | \u20ac 0 - 200 million            | Low                     |\n| Medium           | > \u20ac 50 - 400 million         | > \u20ac 200 - 1,000 million |\n| High             | > \u20ac 400 million              | > \u20ac 1,000 million       |\n\nThe impact of risks and opportunities is presented separate\u00ad ly without offsetting. If no specific reference is made, oppor\u00ad tunities and risks relate to the Automotive segment. The scope of entities consolidated for risk reporting purposes corresponds to the scope of consolidated entities included in the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n\n## Monitoring Risk\u00ad Bearing Capacity\n\nGroup\u00adwide effects and trends can be identified by aggre\u00ad gating all significant risks at Group level using value\u00adat\u00adrisk models. For this purpose, the potential earnings impact of the risks (confidence level: 99 %) is aggregated, taking cor\u00ad relation effects into account. In order to assess the risk\u00adbear\u00ad ing capacity of the BMW Group, the aggregated amount of risks is compared with the risk cover amount (i. e. the equity capital of the BMW Group recognised for accounting pur\u00ad poses). A limit system for various risks helps monitor the risk\u00adbearing capacity.\n\n## Managing Reputational Risks\n\nQuite apart from the financial consequences, risks can also have an impact on the BMW Group's reputation. For these purposes, the BMW Group assesses all risks with regard to their impact on its reputation using a scoring model. More\u00ad over, other overarching topics are monitored by means of regular media analysis. Any significant reputational reper\u00ad cussions are described in the following sections.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing Non\u00adFinancial Risks as Reported in the NFS\n\nAlongside the maintenance of a comprehensive system of risk management, sustainability constitutes a core strategic principle of the BMW Group. Risks resulting from sustain\u00ad ability issues are generally identified via the Group\u00adwide risk management network.\n\nIn accordance with \u00a7 289c of the German Commercial Code (HGB) risks that could have an impact on the non\u00adfinancial aspects referred to in the relevant legislation are reviewed as part of the reporting process. Significant risks in this context are  defined  as  those  stemming  from  business  activities, business relationships and products and services provided by the BMW Group that are highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact. No significant non\u00adfinancial risks were iden\u00ad tified during the year under report.",

Identifying these opportunities is an integral part of the BMW Group's strategic planning process. The Group's range of products and services is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses.\n\nThe continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict cost controls are also essential factors for ensuring high levels of profitability and return on capital employed.\n\nThe importance of opportunities for the BMW Group is clas\u00ad sified on a qualitative basis in the categories 'significant' and 'insignificant'. Probable measures aimed at increasing profitability are already incorporated in the outlook.\n\n## Risks and  Opportunities\n\nThe following table provides an overview of significant risks and opportunities for the years 2022 and 2023 and indicates their level of importance for the BMW Group.

Unforeseen disruptions in global economic re\u00ad lations  can  have  highly  unpredictable  effects.  The  risk amount over the two\u00adyear assessment period is classified as medium.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops has, among other factors, triggered supply restrictions affecting components from Ukraine which have already led to production schedule adjustments and interruptions at a number of BMW Group plants. If the military conflict continues for a prolonged peri\u00ad od, it will also have a perceptible impact on sales.\n\nThere is a risk of a further escalation of the conflict and therefore of the sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia as well as possible retaliatory measures by Russia. Any additional sanctions relating to the capital market and the import and export of goods and raw materials will have distinct consequences that are also likely to have a negative impact on economies outside Russia.\n\nGlobal supply shortfalls - particularly for semiconductors continue  to  dampen  the  prospects  of  economic  growth. These  bottlenecks  could  persist  throughout  the  whole  of 2022,  with  the  resulting  shortage  of  (upstream)  products causing the hitherto strong recovery of the global economy to lose pace.\n\nMutation could result in the emergence of a highly conta\u00ad gious coronavirus variant that could, in tum, cause severe disease.  In  this  case,  strict  containment  measures  could slow down the economic recovery. The BMW Group is moni\u00ad toring the situation on a continuous basis and taking appro\u00ad priate measures as required.\n\nThe conflict between the USA and China is also set to re\u00ad main a major topic of discussion. The focus is currently shift\u00ad\n\ning from simple tariff increases to further import and export restrictions on specific technologies. This could also lead to less  favourable  import  and  export  conditions  for  the BMW Group.\n\nA further risk is seen in the very high rate of inflation current\u00ad ly being observed in many regions. If inflation were to remain high over an extended period, rising prices would curb de\u00ad mand. The expected interest rate hikes by central banks will also have a dampening effect on business.\n\nMacroeconomic opportunities that could have a sustained positive impact on the BMW Group's results of operation are classified as insignificant.\n\n## Strategic and  Sector\u00adSpecific Risks and Opportunities Changes in legislation and regulatory requirements\n\nThe introduction of more stringent legislation and regula\u00ad tions, particularly regarding emissions, safety and consumer protection as well as regional vehicle\u00adrelated purchase and usage taxes, poses a significant risk for the automobile in\u00ad dustry. Country\u00ad and sector\u00adspecific trade barriers can also be subject to change at short notice. Any sudden tightening of regulations in these areas could necessitate significantly higher investments and ongoing expenses or exert influence on customer behaviour. The risk amount attached to the oc\u00ad currence of the risk of disruption in product availability due to unforeseeable short\u00adterm changes in legislation and regula\u00ad tions is classified as high.\n\nAt present, the BMW Group is seeing a continuous trend to\u00ad wards increasingly stringent vehicle emissions regulations, particularly for conventional drive systems, with the aim of improving air quality, above all in conurbations. A legislative proposal for the new Euro 7 emissions standard is being dis\u00ad cussed within the European Union. As the technical require\u00ad ments and the implementation timetable for the new stand\u00ad ard are still subject to consultation, a certain element of risk is involved. A discussion about fuel consumption and carbon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemissions could affect the Company's reputation.\n\nAdditional risks could result from the tightening of existing import and export regulations, which could, in turn, lead pri\u00ad marily to additional expenses, but also complicate the im\u00ad port and export of vehicles and parts.\n\nChanges in trade policies could also have a positive impact on the BMW Group's earnings in the short to medium term. Any reduction in tariff barriers, import restrictions or direct excise duties could result in lower manufacturing costs or enable products and services to be offered to customers at more attractive prices. Additional opportunities potentially arising from changes in legislation and regulations are clas\u00ad sified as insignificant.\n\n## Market developments\n\nIncreasingly fierce competition among established manufac\u00ad turers and the emergence of new competitors can have re\u00ad percussions  that  are  difficult  to  predict.  Unforeseen  con\u00ad sumer preferences and changes in brand perceptions could also give rise to both opportunities and risks. The risk amount attached to the occurrence of market risks over the two\u00adyear assessment period is classified as medium.\n\nAny toughening of market competition could ramp up pres\u00ad sure on sales volume and selling prices. For instance, the BMW Group could be confronted with short\u00adterm supply and demand  distortions  in  the  transition  from  conventionally powered  vehicles  to  alternative  drive  concepts.  Customer behaviour can also change, such as in the event of changing social values and norms or as a consequence of governmen\u00ad tal policies relating to vehicle usage.\n\nSales markets are continuously monitored in order to opti\u00ad mally meet customer requirements and, at the same time, capitalise on opportunities in terms of sales growth and pri\u00ad cing. Opportunities arising over the assessment period are classified as insignificant.",

        "page_content": "Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management\n\n## Risks and  Opportunities Relating to Operations Risks and opportunities relating to production and  technologies\n\nRisks relating to production processes and fields of technol\u00ad ogy can lead to unplanned production interruptions or add\u00ad itional costs due to vehicle recall actions. The risk amount attached to the occurrence of such risks over the two\u00adyear assessment period is classified as medium.\n\nPotential causes of production downtimes include fires, nat\u00ad ural hazards and infrastructural damage as well as machine and tooling breakdowns. Equally significantly, however, pro\u00ad duction could also be impaired by bottlenecks in the supply of production materials or components, utility or media sup\u00ad ply failures or disruptions to transportation, logistics or IT systems,  all  of  which  could  be  caused  by  cyberattacks, among other factors.\n\nAll production units have a variety of measures in place to deal with potential production interruptions and downtimes, some of which are already integrated in the planning process and also applied at operational level with a high degree of flexibility. These measures have an effect on both the amount of damage and the probability of the risks occurring.\n\nTechnical fire protection, transparency with regard to poten\u00ad tial natural hazards relevant for site selection and ongoing operations, underpinned by other appropriate (e. g. struc\u00ad tural) measures, a rapid response by on\u00adsite fire services and employee training are the key strategies for preventing or reducing any potential damage from fires and / or natural hazards. Furthermore, policies are in place with insurance companies of high credit standing to mitigate the impact of any property damage caused by fire and / or natural events that lead to significant business interruptions at either the Group's or suppliers' premises.\n\nAppropriate measures have been put in place to counter the threat of targeted cyberattacks, reflecting the fact that any such attacks could cause damage to production facilities\n\nand  possibly  result  in  long  downtimes  and  substantial losses.\n\nVehicles could be damaged or destroyed by natural hazards or other threats during transport from the Group's production plants to its various sales regions. Premiums and deductibles for transport insurance policies currently remain at a persis\u00ad tently high level. Any further increase could make it econom\u00ad ically unviable to take out insurance, as a result of which the BMW Group would be required to bear the losses itself.\n\nThe BMW Group recognises appropriate provisions for stat\u00ad utory and non\u00adstatutory warranty obligations. It cannot be ruled out, however, that additional costs could arise in con\u00ad junction with vehicle recalls that are either not covered or not fully covered by provisions. Despitely, deploying thorough quality assurance processes, such risks can always arise if the materials and / or processing procedures used prove in\u00ad sufficient, in some cases years after a product has been launched. A high number of recalls could also have a nega\u00ad tive impact on the BMW Group's reputation. Further infor\u00ad mation on risks in conjunction with provisions for statutory and  non\u00adstatutory  warranty  obligations  is  provided  in \u2197 note 33 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nThe development and testing of new technologies inherently give rise to a certain level of risk. An accident - for example involving a vehicle in automated driving mode - could have a negative impact on the Company's reputation, regardless of  cause.  Avoiding  these  risks  is  a  top  priority  for  the BMW Group.\n\nThe BMW Group sees opportunities relating to production processes and fields of technology primarily in the competi\u00ad tive edge gained from mastering new and complex technol\u00ad ogies. Given the long lead times involved in developing new products  and  processes,  additional  opportunities  are  not expected  to  have  a  significant  earnings  impact  on  the BMW Group during the assessment period.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to purchasing\n\nPurchasing risks relate primarily to supply risks caused by the failure of a supplier as well as to threats to BMW Group\u00adrel\u00ad evant  know\u00adhow  within  the  supplier  network.  Production problems  at  supplier  level  could  lead  to  consequences caused by increased expenditure for the BMW Group due to production interruptions and a corresponding reduction in vehicle sales. The BMW Group deploys an extensive set of checks and proactive management measures to tackle the challenges currently facing the automotive supply industry. The risk amount attached to purchasing risks over the two\u00ad year assessment period is classified as high.\n\nPotential reasons for the failure of individual suppliers to de\u00ad liver include IT\u00adrelated risks, non\u00adcompliance with sustain\u00ad ability or quality standards, the lack of availability of raw ma\u00ad terials  and  other  input  materials,  and  the  occurrence  of natural hazards and / or fires. Insufficient financial capacity on the part of individual suppliers can also jeopardise sup\u00ad plies to production plants. In this context, the BMW Group ensures financial support for suppliers that are of critical im\u00ad portance for maintaining production. Moreover, any major deterioration of a particular country's security situation is incorporated in the risk measurement process as a potential reason for the failure of a value or supply chain.\n\nAmong other challenges, the military conflict between Rus\u00ad sia and Ukraine is causing disruptions in the supply of com\u00ad ponents produced in Ukraine. Any further escalation could potentially  affect  both  direct  suppliers  and  upstream sub\u00adsuppliers from neighbouring countries, thereby aggra\u00ad vating  the  supply  situation  still  further  and  curtailing  the availability of raw materials from Russia.\n\nThe growing complexity of the supplier network, particularly in the case of sub\u00adsuppliers whose operations can only be indirectly monitored by the BMW Group, is a further potential cause of downtimes at supplier locations. Due to the high level of demand on international semiconductor markets, the",

        "page_content": "Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management\n\nBMW Group has already experienced temporary bottlenecks in the supply of electronic components.\n\nThe ongoing tight supply situation along the entire supply chain - particularly due to bottlenecks affecting the supply of semiconductors - could continue to result in adjustments to the  production  schedule.  Reporting  on  such  eventualities could also have a negative impact on the Company's reputa\u00ad tion. The BMW Group is monitoring the situation very closely, assessing developments on a continual basis and ensuring that supply chains and production plants are working to\u00ad gether as closely as possible.\n\nThe increased threat of cyberattacks along the entire value chain also affects supply security as well as the ability to protect know\u00adhow relevant to the BMW Group. In order to ensure a uniform level of IT security for all those involved along the value and supply chain, the BMW Group impresses on suppliers the importance of obtaining appropriate IT se\u00ad curity certification.\n\nWhen selecting its suppliers, the BMW Group not only takes into account external requirements, such as those contained in the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferketten\u00ad sorgfaltspflichtengesetz), but also ensures that the sustain\u00ad ability standards set internally by the Group are met.\n\nThe risks associated with the supply of raw materials are mitigated either by reducing the use of the raw materials in question or substituting them with alternative products.\n\nWithin the Purchasing and Supplier Network, opportunities arise primarily in the context of global sourcing and associ\u00ad ated efficiency improvements. Making optimal use of any innovations developed by suppliers is a key prerequisite for developing future\u00adoriented mobility products and services. Similarly, favourable location\u00adrelated cost factors, particular\u00ad ly those arising due to the close proximity of supplier struc\u00ad\n\ntures to new and existing BMW Group production plants as well as the introduction of innovative production techno l\u00ad ogies,  could  lead  to  lower  cost  of  materials  for  the BMW Group.\n\nOpportunities arising over the assessment period are classi\u00ad fied as insignificant.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to the sales network\n\nIn order to sell its products and services, the BMW Group op\u00ad erates  a  global  sales  network  -  mainly  comprising  inde\u00ad pendent dealerships, branches, subsidiaries and importers. Any threat to the continued activities of parts of the sales network, for example due to the impending insolvency of large\u00adscale dealerships, would entail risks for the BMW Group. The risk amount attached to sales and market\u00ad ing risks over the two\u00adyear assessment period is classified as low.\n\nAs in other areas, the BMW Group is shaping the future of its sales organisation with a clear focus on placing the custom\u00ad er experience at the centre of its activities. Our declared aim is to deliver the best premium brand and customer experi\u00ad ence in the industry. A key building block in this endeavour is the digitalisation of the customer journey. In conjunction with the dealership organisation, new opportunities are arising in this context, which the BMW Group, however, classifies as insignificant.\n\n## Information security, data protection and IT\n\nDigitalisation and automation across all areas of the busi\u00ad ness and all BMW Group products offer excellent opportu\u00ad nities that are helping move the organisation forward on its strategic path towards sustainability. At the same time, re\u00ad quirements regarding the confidentiality, integrity and avail\u00ad ability of information are becoming increasingly strict, with a corresponding impact on the related use of information tech\u00ad nology (IT). The level of threat has continuously risen in re\u00ad cent years and the impact of the military conflict between\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRussia and Ukraine could lead to a further increase in the number of cyberattacks. Moreover, legal and regulatory re\u00ad quirements are becoming ever stricter worldwide. Examples include the Second Act to Increase the Security of Informa\u00ad tion Technology Systems (German IT Security Act 2.0) and new data protection laws in China.\n\nIn  view  of  the  higher  incidence  of  observed  attacks  on BMW Group applications and systems, the risk amount despite extensive security measures - is classified as high.\n\nIn addition to threats in the form of cyberattacks and phy s\u00ad ical interventions, information and data can also be compro\u00ad mised by a lack of risk awareness and inappropriate behav\u00ad iour.  The  main  direct  consequences  would  be  negative effects on revenues, disruption in the production of compo\u00ad nents and vehicles, or reputational damage.\n\nThe BMW Group places great emphasis on protecting busi\u00ad ness information, for instance against unauthorised access and / or misuse. Data security is an integral part of all Group business processes and practised in accordance with the ISO / IEC 27001 international standard. In conjunction with risk management requirements, risks relating to information security,  data  protection  and  IT  are  systematically  docu\u00ad mented, allocated appropriate measures by the departments concerned and continuously monitored with regard to threat level and risk mitigation. Regular analyses and controls as well as tight security management policies ensure an appro\u00ad priate level of security.\n\nHowever, despite continuous testing and preventive security measures, it is impossible to completely eliminate risks in this area. All authorised persons are required to treat infor\u00ad mation such as confidential business, customer and em\u00ad ployee  data  with  great  care,  use  information  systems securely and handle risks in a transparent manner. Uniform requirements that apply throughout the Group are",

A consistently applied policy of updating such rules and reg\u00ad ulations to current situations, coupled with regular commu\u00ad nication, awareness\u00adraising and training measures, form the basis  for  a  high  level  of  security  and  risk  awareness  in general.\n\nWith regard to cooperations and business partnerships, the BMW Group protects its intellectual property as well as its customer and employee data by issuing clearly defined in\u00ad structions on information security and data protection. Trade secrets and sensitive personal data are subject to particular\u00ad ly stringent security measures.\n\nThe loss or theft of sensitive business information could also have a negative impact on the Company's reputation.\n\n## Financial Risks and Risks relating to the use of Financial Instruments\n\n## Currency risks and opportunities\n\nAs an internationally operating enterprise, the BMW Group conducts business in a variety of currencies, thus giving rise to currency risks and opportunities. A substantial portion of Group revenues, production, other purchases and funding occur outside the eurozone, particularly in China and the USA. Regularly updated cash\u00adflow\u00adat\u00adrisk models and scen\u00ad ario analyses are used to measure currency risks and oppor\u00ad tunities. The risk amount associated with currency risks is classified as low. The risk situation is more favourable than in the previous year, as exchange rates have developed posi\u00ad tively compared with those assumed in earlier forecasts.\n\nOperational currency management is based on the results of currency risk analyses. The BMW Group manages currency risks at both strategic (medium to long term) and operational level (short to medium term). Medium\u00ad to long\u00adterm meas\u00ad ures include increasing production and purchase volumes in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nforeign currency regions, i. e. natural hedging. Currency risks are managed in the short to medium term and for operation\u00ad al purposes by means of hedging on financial markets. The principal objective is to increase planning reliability for the BMW Group. Hedging transactions are entered into only with financial partners of good credit standing. Depending on ex\u00ad change  rate  developments,  significant  opportunities  may arise.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices\n\nAs a manufacturing company, the BMW Group is exposed to purchase price risks, particularly in relation to the raw mate\u00ad rials used in vehicle production. Changes in prices are moni\u00ad tored via a well\u00addefined management process, the primary objective of which is to improve planning reliability for the BMW Group as a whole.\n\nThe analysis of raw materials price risks is based on planned purchases  of  raw  materials  and  components  containing those  products.  Cash\u00adflow\u00adat\u00adrisk  models  and  scenario analyses are deployed to measure risks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices. Price fluctuations for pre\u00ad cious  metals  (platinum,  palladium,  rhodium),  non\u00adferrous metals  (aluminium,  copper),  raw  materials  for  batteries (lead, nickel, cobalt) and, to some extent, for steel and its basic ingredients (iron ore, coking coal) as well as energy (gas, electricity) are hedged using financial derivatives and supply contracts with fixed pricing arrangements.\n\nDue to high demand, the prices of many raw materials have been, and continue to be, subject to a high degree of fluctu\u00ad ations on commodity markets. Accordingly, the risk amount associated with raw materials prices is classified as high. Significant opportunities could arise if raw materials prices, contrary to current expectations, develop favourably for the BMW Group.",

Liquidity risks can arise in the form of rising refinancing costs or from restricted access to funds due to the general market situation. The risk amount associated with liquidity risks is classified as low.\n\nBased on the experience gained during the global financial crisis, a liquidity concept has been drawn up, which is rigor\u00ad ously adhered to and continuously developed. In the Finan\u00ad cial Services segment, the use of the 'matched funding prin\u00ad ciple' ensures that liquidity risks are generally avoided.\n\nSolvency is assured at all times throughout the BMW Group by adhering to liquidity ratios and using a broadly diversified range  of  refinancing  sources.  Regular  measurement  and monitoring ensure that cash inflows and outflows for the vari ous maturities and currencies offset one another. This approach is an integral part of the BMW Group's liquidity concept.\n\nThe liquidity position is monitored continuously and man\u00ad aged through the Group\u00adwide planning of financial require\u00ad ments and funding. At present, opportunities relating to li\u00ad quidity are not expected to have any significant earnings impact. Further information on risks in conjunction with fi\u00ad nancial instruments is provided in \u2197 note 39 to the Group Fi\u00ad nancial Statements.\n\n## Other financial risks\n\nOther financial risks worth mentioning include counterparty risks as well as those arising in connection with investments in other entities.\n\nThe BMW Group works together with banks to ensure that the available liquidity is optimally invested in order to hedge against  financial  market  risks  (particularly  currency,  com\u00ad modity and interest rate risks) using derivative financial in\u00ad\n\nstruments and to protect payments made in advance. Coun\u00ad terparty risk denotes the risk that the BMW Group will not receive, or not receive in full, the payments due to it in con\u00ad nection with the investment and hedging transactions re\u00ad ferred to above. An enhanced value\u00adat\u00adrisk model is em\u00ad ployed to measure counterparty risk, taking into account the creditworthiness (rating) of the banks and the business vol\u00ad umes involved. Risk is managed using a limit system, which includes daily monitoring of the extent to which limits are being utilised at the level of the individual counterparties.\n\nThe  BMW Group  holds  equity  investments  of  varying amounts in numerous entities, which could give rise to risks requiring the recognition of impairment losses.\n\nThe risk amount associated with other financial risks is clas\u00ad sified as medium. Generally speaking revaluations of invest\u00ad ments  could  give  rise  to  opportunities  with  a  significant earnings impact.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to pension obligations\n\nFuture pension obligations are financed largely via external pension funds or trust constructs that are legally separate from the BMW Group. Externally managed funds are invest\u00ad ed on capital markets in a broadly diversified portfolio with a view to enabling future pension payments to be disbursed out of pension assets. These arrangements greatly reduce the  need  to  fund  pension  payments  out  of  ongoing operations.\n\nRisks can arise from fluctuations in pension obligations on the one hand and the related pension assets on the other. Opportunities can arise if the value of pension assets on capital markets develops favourably or if pension obligations decrease at a more pronounced rate than the related assets.\n\nPension obligations are primarily measured using a discount rate  based  on  market  yields  from  high\u00adquality  corporate bonds. These yields are subject to market fluctuations and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntherefore influence the level of pension obligations. Changes in other parameters, such as rising inflation rates and longer life expectancy, also impact the amount as well as the dura\u00ad tion of future pension payments. Regulatory requirements or changes may also affect the amount of pension obligations.\n\nThe fluctuation of pension assets reflects the volatility of in\u00ad dividual asset classes on capital markets. The broadly diver\u00ad sified  portfolio  comprises  investments  in  interest\u00adbearing securities, equities, real estate and other asset classes.\n\nThe risk relating to pension obligations was substantially re\u00ad duced by the restructuring of pension commitments in Ger\u00ad many  in  2021.  Under  the  new  arrangements,  employees were given the option to switch to the Company's defined contribution pension plan. While the latter entails the risk as\u00ad sociated with guaranteeing a minimum rate of return, the overall risk is lower than that arising in connection with the defined benefit pension plan.\n\nThe risk amount attached to pension obligations is classified as medium.\n\nRemeasurements on the liabilities and assets sides are rec\u00ad ognised net of deferred taxes through other comprehensive income and hence directly in equity of the BMW Group (with\u00ad in revenue reserves). Further information on risks in conjunc\u00ad tion with pension provisions is provided in \u2197 note  32 to the Group Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management\n\n## Legal Risks\n\nDue to the global nature of its operations, the BMW Group is exposed to various legal risks. Legal risks may result from  non\u00adcompliance  with  laws  or  other  legal  require\u00ad ments, or from legal disputes with business partners or other market participants. If legal risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two\u00adyear assessment period. The risk amounts attached to signifi\u00ad cant identified legal risks are classified as medium.\n\nThe growing globalisation of the BMW Group's operations as well as of business interdependencies in general, com\u00ad bined with the variety and complexity of legal provisions increasingly including import and export regulations - give rise to a greater risk of non\u00adcompliance with applicable legislation. A Compliance Management System is in place across the BMW Group to ensure that its representative bodies, executives and staff members worldwide consist\u00ad ently act in a lawful manner. Further information on com\u00ad pliance within the BMW Group as well as on the Compli\u00ad ance  Management  System  is  provided  in  the  chapter \u2197 Compliance and human rights .\n\nLike all entities with international operations, the BMW Group is confronted with legal disputes and alleged claims relating in particular to warranty and product liabil\u00ad ity, infringements of protected rights and proceedings initi\u00ad ated by government agencies. Any of these could, amongst other  consequences,  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the Group's reputation. Proceedings of this nature are essen\u00ad tially typical for the sector, may result as a consequence of realigning  product  or  purchasing  strategies  to  changed market conditions, or are antitrust\u00ad related. Particularly in the US market, class action lawsuits and product liability risks  can  have  substantial  financial  consequences  and cause damage to the BMW Group's reputation. More rigor\u00ad ous application, interpretation of, or changes to, existing regulations could result in a greater number of  recalls.\n\nFor several years, lawsuits have been filed against BMW Bank GmbH (BMW Bank) in which consumers claim the withdrawal of their loan and leasing contracts on the basis of allegedly incorrect and insufficient pre\u00adcontractual infor\u00ad mation. The focus is on loan contracts. Since 2017, BMW Bank has won the vast majority of these lawsuits. In No\u00ad vember 2019, the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) adopted a decision of principle in favour of BMW Bank, confirming the accuracy  of  consumer\u00adrelevant  information  in  loan  con\u00ad tracts. In addition, in October 2020 the BGH decided in a case in which BMW Bank was not involved that consumers are generally obliged to pay a compensation after a suc\u00ad cessful withdrawal. Since the beginning of 2020, several references for a preliminary ruling on the scope of informa\u00ad tion obligations have been filed with the European Court of Justice (ECJ). On September 9, 2021, the ECJ decided on the requests for preliminary ruling concerning the require\u00ad ments  on  the  terms  and  conditions  in  consumer  credit agreements in particular with regard to default interest and prepayment  penalty.  Based  on  this  ruling  the  BGH  re\u00ad quests the ECJ for another preliminary ruling whether the concept of abuse of rights in connection with consumer credit agreements is still applicable under certain circum\u00ad stances. Although this is technically not a final decision, the BGH mentioned in the reasoning part of its decision that it does not consider BMW Bank's terms and conditions in consumer credit agreements to completely fulfill the re\u00ad quirements as set by the ECJ ruling. Therefore, there is a legal risk that borrowers might withdraw consumer credit agreements of BMW Bank with reference to the proceeding submitted to the ECJ and the ECJ decision as of September 9, 2021. However, the right to compensation of BMW Bank due to the car use period of the borrower is still applicable. The  possible  financial  impact  cannot  be  definitively  as\u00ad sessed at this stage.\n\nInternational movements of goods require compliance with extensive  export  control  regulations.  In  addition  to\n\ngoods\u00adrelated restrictions, international trading may also involve personal, country\u00adspecific and end\u00aduse\u00adrelated re\u00ad strictions.  In  particular,  non\u00adcompliance  with  applicable EU and US export control regulations could result in signif\u00ad icant legal consequences for the BMW Group. In light of its strong presence in the USA and China, any intensification of the trade dispute between the two countries could be a potential source of additional risk exposure.\n\nThe BMW Group is subject to tax and customs audits in every country in which it operates, potentially resulting in back taxes, retrospective customs duties, interest, penal\u00ad ties and similar payments. Payments of this nature may, for instance, result from the full or the partial non\u00adrecogni\u00ad tion of intercompany transfer prices in the countries con\u00ad cerned. Further substantive legal risks may also arise as a result of changes in tax or customs legislation or due to the way that legislation is interpreted by tax and customs au\u00ad thorities or courts. In many cases, such changes can also have a retrospective impact on calendar years that were not yet subject to definitive audits. In order to minimise procedural tax and customs risks, the BMW Group recently set up a comprehensive Tax and Customs Control Frame\u00ad work that is already being applied in Germany and will be rolled out successively in other countries.\n\nThe BMW Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for lawsuits and risks. In addition, a part of these risks is insured to an economically reasonable extent. Neverthe\u00ad less, it cannot be ruled out that damages may occur in ex\u00ad cess of the insured amounts. In accordance with Interna\u00ad tional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the required information is not provided if the BMW Group concludes that disclosure of the information could seriously prejudice the outcome of the relevant legal proceedings. Further in\u00ad formation on contingent liabilities is provided in \u2197 note 38 to the Group Financial Statements.",

The main tool used to manage risk within the Financial Ser\u00ad vices segment is to ensure its risk\u00adbearing capacity.\n\nAll risks - in the sense of unexpected losses - must be cov\u00ad ered at all times. Based on the segment's risk appetite, this is achieved by ensuring specified levels of risk\u00adcovering as\u00ad sets (asset cushions) in the form of equity capital. Unexpect\u00ad ed losses are measured using various value\u00adat\u00adrisk models, which are validated at regular intervals. Risks are aggregat\u00ad ed after taking account of correlation effects. In addition to assessing the Group's ability to bear risk, stress scenarios are also examined. The segment's risk\u00adbearing capacity is regularly controlled by means of an integrated limit system for the various risk categories.\n\nDue to the close interrelationships within the Group, devel\u00ad opments that affect the BMW Group's industrial business in the first step are also relevant for the Financial Services seg\u00ad ment in the second step. In addition, banking supervisory agencies around the world require sustainability risks to be adequately addressed. Sustainability risks, such as natural events or a change in carbon pricing, affect existing risk cat\u00ad egories and can also have an impact in the short term.\n\nThe following overview provides a summary of the main risks and opportunities in the Financial Services segment:\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nThe main categories of risk relevant for financial services business are credit and counterparty risk, residual value risk, interest  rate  risk,  operational  risk  and  liquidity  risk.  The evaluation of liquidity risk for the Financial Services segment is included in the liquidity risk category for the Group as a whole.\n\n## Credit and counterparty risks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nCredit and counterparty default risk arises within the Finan\u00ad cial Services segment if a contractual partner (e. g. a cus\u00ad tomer or dealership) becomes either unable or only partially able to fulfil its contractual obligations, so that less income is generated or losses are incurred. Among other consequenc\u00ad es, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine could also result in credit losses. The risk amount attached to the occurrence of unexpected credit or counterparty default risks over the two\u00adyear assessment period is classified as medi\u00ad um. The BMW Group classifies potential opportunities in this area as insignificant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the financial year 2021, the Financial Services segment benefited among other things from a favourable risk situ\u00ad ation and the resulting lower level of impairment allowances required. Credit losses were at an historically low level.\n\nInitial and continuous creditworthiness testing is an import\u00ad ant aspect of the BMW Group's credit risk management sys\u00ad tem. For this reason, every borrower's creditworthiness is tested for all credit financing and leasing contracts entered into by the BMW Group. Opportunities may arise if the man\u00ad aged  portfolio  performs  better  over  time  than  estimated when the credits were granted. Changes in the creditworthi\u00ad ness of customers arising during the credit term are covered by risk provisioning procedures. The credit risk of individual customers is quantified on a monthly basis and, depending on the outcome, taken into account within the risk provision\u00ad ing  system.  Macroeconomic  developments  are  currently subject to a higher degree of volatility. If developments are more favourable than assumed in the outlook, credit losses may be lower than expected, leading to a positive earnings impact.\n\n|                       | Risks                                         | Risks                                    | Opportunities                | Opportunities                         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk           | Classification   of the risk amount  1 Medium | Change compared  to prior year  2 Stable | Classification Insignificant | Change compared  to prior year Stable |\n| Residual value        | High                                          | Stable                                   | Significant                  | Stable                                |\n| Interest rate changes | Low                                           | Stable                                   | Significant                  | Stable                                |\n| Operational risks     | Medium                                        | Increased                                | -                            | -                                     |\n\n- 1 The classified risk amount does not change as a result of the full consolidation of BMW Brilliance.",

        "page_content": "Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management\n\n## Residual value risks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nRisks  and  opportunities  arise  in  conjunction  with  leasing contracts if the market value of a leased vehicle at the end of the contractual term of a lease differs from the residual value estimated at the commencement date of the lease. A re\u00ad sidual value risk exists if the expected market value of the vehicle at the end of the contractual term is lower than its estimated residual value at the date the contract was  entered into. The risk amount attached to the occurrence of unex\u00ad pected residual value risks over the two\u00adyear assessment period is classified as high. Opportunities can arise out of a positive deviation between the actual market value and the original residual value forecast. The BMW Group classifies potential residual value opportunities as significant.\n\nEach vehicle's estimated residual value is calculated at the beginning of the contract on the basis of historical external and internal data. Developments on pre\u00adowned car markets are an important factor for the BMW Group. The BMW Group has developed and implemented specialised methods and processes that enable the sustainability aspects of residual value risks to be appropriately assessed and managed.\n\nMarket developments are observed throughout the contrac\u00ad tual period and the risk assessment updated accordingly. Residual  value  risk  management  essentially  follows  the same established process, regardless of the drive system variant.\n\nThe  exceptional  upturn  in  the  pre\u00adowned  vehicle  market, particularly in the USA and the UK, combined with high lev\u00ad els of revenue generated on lease returns sold, had a cor\u00ad respondingly positive effect on the residual value situation across the Financial Services segment during the financial year 2021. This development was reflected in the lower level of residual value risk provisioning required.\n\n## Interest rate risks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nInterest rate risks in the Financial Services segment relate to potential losses caused by changes in market interest rates. These  can  arise  when  fixed  interest  rate  periods  do  not match for assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet. The risk amount attached to interest rate risks is clas\u00ad sified as low. Favourable interest rate developments com\u00ad pared  to  the  outlook  represent  opportunities  that  the BMW Group classifies as significant. Interest rate risks in the Financial Services business are managed by ensuring that fixed  interest  rate  periods  match  to  a  large  extent  and through the use of interest\u00adrate derivatives. If the relevant recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled,  derivatives  used  by  the BMW Group are accounted for as hedging relationships. Fur\u00ad ther information on risks in conjunction with financial instru\u00ad ments  is  provided  in \u2197 note  39 to  the  Group  Financial Statements.\n\n## Operational risks relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, operational risks are de\u00ad fined as the risk of losses arising due to the unsuitability or failure of internal procedures (process risks), people (per\u00ad sonnel\u00adrelated risks), systems (infrastructure and IT risks) and  external  events  (external  risks).  The  recording  and measurement of risk scenarios, loss events and counter\u00ad measures in the operational risk management system pro\u00ad vide the basis for the systematic analysis and management of potential or materialised operational risks. Annual self\u00adas\u00ad sessments are also carried out.\n\nDue to closer interconnection with other risk categories, such as outsourcing risks or information security risks, the level of the risk amount has been raised slightly from low to medium compared to the previous year. The classification of the risk amount has changed to medium as the pertinent threshold of \u20ac200 million was exceeded for the first time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate\u00adRelated  Opportunities and Risks\n\nNumerous developments of relevance for the BMW Group are either directly or indirectly linked to climate\u00adrelated is\u00ad sues. The BMW Group is taking action to mitigate the impact of climate change and to adapt to changing climatic condi\u00ad tions. It is therefore imperative to identify climate\u00adrelated risks and opportunities and to take appropriate account of them in determining the strategic direction to be followed, managing the business and organising a Group\u00adwide risk management system. Since 2019, the BMW Group has been acting on the recommendations of the Task Force on Cli\u00ad mate\u00adrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and is continu\u00ad ously developing its reporting on the management of cli\u00ad mate\u00adrelated risks and opportunities.\n\nWhen considering climate\u00adrelated risks, the BMW Group dis\u00ad tinguishes between physical and transitory risks. Physical risks refer to the actual impact of climate change. Physical risks attributable to fundamental changes in climatic condi\u00ad tions, such as rising temperatures or changing precipitation patterns, are referred to as chronic and generally have a longer\u00adterm effect. We therefore monitor these risks over a period of up to 30 years. However, extreme weather events such as storms, floods and heatwaves are already becoming more frequent.\n\nTransitory risks, on the other hand, arise from the transition to a low\u00adcarbon economy. This category of risks includes for example new and additional legal requirements relating to climate protection. We also see the changes resulting from the transition to a low\u00adcarbon future as an opportunity. In\u00ad novative products and services enable us to develop new fields of business, help decarbonise the mobility sector and thus boost our competitiveness at the same time.\n\n## Organisation and processes for managing climate\u00adrelated risks\n\nWithin the BMW Group, the Board of Management is directly responsible for all matters relating to climate change includ\u00ad ing dealing with the consequences of climate change.

        "page_content": "Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management\n\ncordingly, the individual members of the Board of Manage\u00ad ment are each charged with the task of ensuring that their portfolios are strategically aligned with the stated objectives. Moreover, each proposal presented to the Board of Manage\u00ad ment is required to be assessed from a sustainability per\u00ad spective and thus also with regard to climate\u00adrelated as\u00ad pects. \u2197 Internal management within strategy\n\nAs part of the environmental analysis as part of the strategy process,  the  BMW Group  analyses  and  takes  account  of transitory risks from a regulatory perspective on a continu\u00ad ous  basis.  During  the  financial  year  under  report,  the BMW Group successfully completed its 'Adaptation to Cli\u00ad mate Change' project with the involvement of top manage\u00ad ment.  The  physical  climate  risks  were  analysed  and  as\u00ad sessed using an external assessment tool.\n\n## Scenario analyses for identifying climate\u00adrelated  opportunities and risks\n\nThe BMW Group focuses on both mitigating and adapting to the consequences of climate change.\n\nIn the Adaptation to Climate Change project, we identified and assessed physical risks comprehensively for the first time on the basis of two different time horizons (2030 and 2050) as well as various climate change scenarios. Three warming  pathways  developed  by  the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were applied and, in ac\u00ad cordance  with  the  TCFD  recommendation,  the  impact  of physical risks on the various stages of the value chain (in\u00ad cluding real estate, logistics and suppliers) was examined.\n\nThe so\u00adcalled RCP * scenarios range from a low\u00ademissions scenario in line with the 2\u00b0C target (RCP 2.6), a medium scen ario with global warming of 2.4-2.7\u00b0C by the year 2100 (RCP 4.5) through to a 5\u00b0C scenario (RCP 8.5). On the one\n\nhand, the RCP 2.6 scenario entails high transitory risks for the BMW Group due to stricter regulatory requirements gov\u00ad erning carbon emissions. On the other hand, fewer physical risks would be likely to arise given the more ambitious cli\u00ad mate protection measures. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, how\u00ad ever, the physical risks dominate due to insufficient climate protection measures. Based on the BMW Group's assess\u00ad ment, the RCP 4.5 scenario is currently seen as the most likely and roughly corresponds to the contributions currently committed to by each country at national level.\n\n## Physical climate risks\n\n- - Climate change is likely to cause natural disasters to oc\u00ad cur more frequently at our locations, for example heavy rains and heat waves, with the risk of damage to both inventories and products. To avoid production stoppages, we have already taken preventive measures at our pro\u00ad duction sites and other premises, such as the installation of sluice gates at the plant in Chennai, India.\n- - Extreme weather events at suppliers' locations world\u00ad wide can impact component deliveries and consequently supplies  to  production  plants.  Under  these  circum\u00ad stances, key transport routes could be blocked - with im\u00ad plications for both the supply of components and the dis\u00ad tribution of new vehicles.\n- - Physical climate risks could have a negative impact on economic growth in the regions affected, with noticeable unfavourable macroeconomic consequences, including a loss of income and the threat of unemployment for con\u00ad sumers. These factors, in turn, could reduce purchasing power in certain regions and have a negative impact on the BMW Group's sales volumes and operating result.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transitory climate risks\n\n- - A significant tightening of laws and regulations in the BMW Group's main markets (the EU, the USA and  China), particularly  in  terms  of  carbon  emissions  regulations which may also result from possible legal proceedings or court decisions and regional vehicle purchase and usage taxes, could have an impact on the BMW Group's range of  products  and  services  and  result  in  higher  costs and / or lower sales volumes. \u2197 Changes in legislation and regula\u00ad tory requirements\n- -Any serious failure to comply with sustainability or qual\u00ad ity standards could cause disruptions in the supply chain or the inability of individual suppliers to deliver.\n- - The aim is to reduce carbon emissions across all relevant supply chains on the basis of constructive cooperation with suppliers. It is important to point out, however, that the BMW Group depends on receiving accurate informa\u00ad tion from suppliers in this regard.\n- - However, if the carbon price were to rise to unexpected levels without sufficient time to plan accordingly, produc\u00ad tion costs will be driven up, with a correspondingly nega\u00ad tive impact on the BMW Group's sales volumes and prof\u00ad itability. Furthermore, setting a price for carbon emissions could result in reduced purchasing power and thus hold down economic growth in the regions concerned.\n- - The global spread of electric mobility may give rise to bottlenecks in the availability of raw materials, particular\u00ad ly those needed to manufacture battery cells. As a result, higher raw materials prices could also have an impact on the BMW Group's earnings situation.",

Due to the po\u00ad tential macroeconomic consequences, the related sus\u00ad tainability risks are seen as a threat to the stability of financial markets. They could also have a negative im\u00ad pact on job security as well as the financial position of selected industries and their employees.\n\n## Climate\u00adrelated opportunities\n\n- - With its flexible vehicle architectures and production sys\u00ad tems, the BMW Group strives to take account of fluctuat\u00ad ing customer demand as well as regulatory and infra\u00ad structural  differences  in  its  markets  in  a  swift  and adaptable manner. \u2197 Production network\n- - The BMW Group sees the growing demand for electrified vehicles as a major opportunity. We are leveraging this opportunity by continuously expanding our range of elec\u00ad trified products, while at the same time pressing ahead with the in\u00adhouse development and production of electric drive systems, batteries and battery cell prototypes. This approach enables us to secure key know\u00adhow in new technologies at an early stage, gain crucial systems ex\u00ad pertise and exploit cost advantages, which could also provide a decisive competitive edge. \u2197 Production network\n- - The BMW Group's strategic planning assumptions will endeavour to anticipate the consequences of rising car\u00ad bon prices in the form of taxes and levies as well as po\u00ad tential  shortfalls  in  emissions  credits  under  emissions trading schemes, taking into account the assumptions applied in its own decision\u00admaking process and its coop\u00ad eration with suppliers. \u2197 Circular economy, resource efficiency and\n\nrenewable efficiency\n\n- - The BMW Group can exert its influence across its global supplier network to cut carbon emissions and work to\u00ad wards implementing decarbonisation measures. For in\u00ad stance, it has already entered into a contractual agree\u00ad ment  with  its  cell  manufacturers  that  only  green electricity will be used to produce the fifth generation of battery  cells. \u2197 Supplier  network  and  purchases and \u2197 Decarbo\u00ad nisation\n- - By  switching  to  lower\u00adcarbon  processes  and  technol\u00ad ogies at its own production plants, the BMW Group is not only boosting efficiency, but also cutting its costs. For ex\u00ad ample, generating its own electricity from renewable en\u00ad ergy sources reduces the carbon footprint and minimises dependence on external electricity sources as well as its exposure  to  price  fluctuations  on  the  energy  market. \u2197 Renewable energy\n- - In the best interest of a circular economy, the BMW Group intends to gradually increase its use of secondary mater\u00ad ials and hence reduce carbon emissions at the same time. With this strategy, we are not only contributing to\u00ad wards achieving our decarbonisation target in the supply chain, but also reducing our dependence on primary ma\u00ad terials in terms of their availability and cost. \u2197 Circular econ\u00ad omy and resource efficiency\n- - By  reporting  comprehensively  and  transparently  in  a manner that meets potential legal requirements at an early stage, we are better able to ensure our access to capital  markets  and  obtain  attractive  financing  condi\u00ad tions on a long\u00adterm basis. \u2197 BMW Group and Capital Markets\n\nBy rigorously aligning its corporate strategy to meet specific sustainability targets, the BMW Group takes appropriate ac\u00ad count of risks and opportunities in all its investments, in\u00ad novations and corporate decisions.",

        "page_content": "Internal Control System\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe Internal Control System* (ICS) is part of the BMW Group's overall system of internal governance, and is based on a set of measures and control activities that are integrated in pro\u00ad cesses and organisational structures with a view to ensuring the accuracy of external financial and non\u00adfinancial report\u00ad ing. The requirements for the design and structure of ICS procedures incorporated in accounting and financial report\u00ad ing processes as well as those used to  generate selected non\u00adfinancial information included in the BMW Group Report are defined on a Group\u00adwide basis.\n\nThe ICS for financial reporting has the task of ensuring that the BMW Group's accounting and financial reporting pro\u00ad cesses are both accurate and reliable. The ICS for non\u00adfinan\u00ad cial reporting focuses primarily on the further development of  the  processes  used  to  gather  data  as  the  basis  for reporting  non\u00adfinancial  performance  indicators  within  the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe BMW Group's ICS is based on the 'Three Lines of De\u00ad fence' model, including a clear definition of how the various functions are required to interact with one another to man\u00ad age risks. As an essential component of the second line of defence, the ICS serves as a link between the operating units (first line), internal audit (third line) and the external auditor.\n\nInternationally acknowledged standards for internal control systems were taken into account when designing the various elements of the ICS deployed by the BMW Group. The sys\u00ad tem comprises:\n\n- - Group\u00adwide mandatory accounting guidelines\n- - Controls integrated in processes and IT systems\n- - Organisational measures incorporating the principles of the risk\u00adoriented segregation of duties\n- - Process\u00adindependent monitoring measures\n\nBasically, the aim of any internal control system is to prevent, or reduce the probability of, potential risks from occurring. Both the system itself and the methods applied are subject to continuous improvement, with system effectiveness as\u00ad sessed regularly on the basis of centralised and decentral\u00ad ised process analyses, data analyses within the various fi\u00ad nancial systems, and audit\u00adrelated procedures.\n\nThe principal features of the BMW Group's ICS are described below.\n\nGuidelines for recognising, measuring and allocating items to accounts, along with the definitions of non\u00adfinancial per\u00ad formance indicators are available to all employees via the BMW Group's  intranet  system.  New  financial  reporting standards are assessed at an early stage for their impact on the BMW Group's accounting and financial reporting sys\u00ad tems. Pertinent requirements are reviewed continuously and revised at least once a year, or more frequently if required.\n\nPreventive controls serve to identify and eliminate weak\u00ad nesses and omissions in processes. Detective controls on the other hand are deployed to detect and correct any errors in the results of those processes and are generally based on the principle of the segregation of duties. All key relevant IT systems incorporate controls that are designed, among other\n\nthings, to prevent business transactions from being recorded incorrectly, ensure the complete recognition and accurate of business transactions in accordance with the applicable re\u00ad quirements, and provide the basis for checking the accuracy of consolidation procedures.\n\nWhenever changes are made to IT systems relating to ac\u00ad counting and financial reporting processes, the aforemen\u00ad tioned controls are adapted to take account of new require\u00ad ments  and/or  any  opportunities  that  have  arisen  due  to technical advances in information technology. Moreover, the BMW Group  deploys  data  analysis  tools  to  identify  and subsequently eliminate weaknesses in its processes and/or control systems.\n\nResponsibilities for ensuring the effectiveness of ICS proce\u00ad dures for accounting and financial reporting processes as well as the further development of the reporting of non\u00adfi\u00ad nancial performance indicators are clearly defined in a role\u00ad based model and allocated to the relevant line and process managers. Once a year, the managers responsible report on their assessment of the ICS in place for accounting and fi\u00ad nancial reporting processes, based on the results of both internal and external audits as well as continual monitoring. The results of the assessment are gathered and document\u00ad ed in a centralised IT system. Any weaknesses found in the ICS are eliminated, taking into account their potential im\u00ad pact. Both the Board of Management and the Audit Commit\u00ad tee are informed about the effectiveness of the ICS on an annual basis. The Board of Management and, where appro\u00ad priate, the Supervisory Board, are promptly informed in the event of any significant changes to the ICS.",

Ac\u00ad cordingly, the unappropriated profit is required to be appro\u00ad priated in the following order:\n\n- (a) Subsequent  payment  of  any  arrears  on  dividends  on non\u00advoting  shares  of  preferred  stock  in  the  order  of accruement\n- (b) Payment of an advance dividend of \u20ac 0.02 per \u20ac 1 par value on non\u00advoting shares of preferred stock\n- (c) Uniform payment of any other dividends on shares of common and preferred stock, provided the shareholders do not resolve otherwise at the Annual General Meeting\n\n## Restrictions affecting voting rights or the transfer of shares\n\nIn addition to shares of common stock, the Company has also issued non\u00advoting shares of preferred stock. Further in\u00ad formation can be found in the section 'Composition of sub\u00ad scribed capital'.\n\nWhen the Company issues non\u00advoting shares of preferred stock to employees in conjunction with its Employee Share Programme, these shares are generally subject to a Com\u00ad pany\u00adimposed blocking period of four years, calculated from the beginning of the calendar year in which the shares were issued.\n\nContractual  holding  period  arrangements  also  apply  to shares of common stock acquired by Board of Management members and certain senior department heads in conjunc\u00ad tion with share\u00adbased remuneration programmes. \u2197 Remuner\u00ad ation Report\n\n<!-- image -->",

All amounts are disclosed in millions of euros (\u20ac million) unless stated otherwise.\n\nKey figures presented in the report have been rounded in accordance with standard commercial practise. In certain cases, this may mean that values do not add up exactly to the stated total and that percentages cannot be derived from the values shown.\n\nThe income statement for the BMW Group and segments is presented using the cost of sales method.\n\nIn order to provide a better insight into the results of opera\u00ad tions, financial position and net assets of the BMW Group, and going beyond the requirements of IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the Group Financial Statements also include an income statement and a balance sheet for the Automotive, Motorcycles,  Financial  Services  and  Other  Entities  seg\u00ad ments. The Group Cash Flow Statement is supplemented by a statement of cash flows for the Automotive and Financial Services segments. Inter\u00adsegment transactions relate pri\u00ad marily to internal sales of products, the provision of funds for Group companies and the related interest. A description of the nature of the business and the major operating activities of  the  BMW Group's  segments  is  provided  in \u2197  note  45 ('Explanatory notes to segment information').\n\nApproval for the publication of the Group Financial State\u00ad ments was granted by the Board of Management on 8 March 2022.\n\n## 02  Group reporting entity and consolidation principles\n\nThe BMW Group Financial Statements include BMW AG and all material subsidiaries over which BMW AG - either directly or indirectly - exercises control. This also includes 59 struc\u00ad tured entities, consisting of asset\u00adbacked financing arrange\u00ad ments and special purpose funds.\n\nIn  relation  to  fully  consolidated  companies,  the  following changes took place in the Group reporting entity in the finan\u00ad cial year 2021:\n\n|                                     | Germany   | Foreign   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Included at                         |           |           |         |\n| 31 December 2020                    | 21        | 185       | 206     |\n| Included for the first time in 2021 | -         | 16        | 16      |\n| No longer included in 2021          | 1         | 16        | 17      |\n| Included at                         |           |           |         |\n| 31 December 2021                    | 20        | 185       | 205     |\n\nAll  consolidated  subsidiaries  have  the  same  year\u00adend  as BMW AG with the exception of BMW India Private Ltd. and BMW India Financial Services Private Ltd., whose year\u00adends are 31 March in accordance with local legal requirements. Interim financial statements are prepared as at 31 December for the two companies with divergent reporting dates.\n\nWhen assessing whether an investment gives rise to a con\u00ad trolled entity, an associated company, a joint operation or a joint venture, the BMW Group considers contractual arrange\u00ad ments and other circumstances, as well as the structure and legal form of the entity. Discretionary decisions may also be required. If indications exist of a change in the judgement of",

As a general rule, the Group is assumed to have significant influence if it holds 20 % or more of the entity's voting power.\n\nJoint operations and joint ventures are forms of joint arrange\u00ad ments.  Such  an  arrangement  exists  when  a  BMW Group entity jointly carries out activities with a third party on the basis of a contractual agreement.\n\nIn the case of a joint operation, the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of a joint opera\u00ad tion are recognised proportionately in the Group Financial Statements on the basis of the BMW Group entity's rights and obligations (proportionate consolidation). The impact of joint operations on the Group Financial Statements are of minor significance.\n\nThe BMW Group's largest joint operation is Spotlight Auto\u00ad motive Limited (Spotlight), which has been operated jointly with the Chinese automobile manufacturer Great Wall Motor Company Limited (Great Wall) since 2019, jointly developing and manufacturing electric vehicles in China. The BMW Group and Great Wall each hold 50 % of the joint operation's equity. In addition to electric MINI vehicles, Spotlight will in future also develop and produce electric vehicles for Great Wall.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial   Statements\n\nIn the case of a joint venture, the parties which have joint control only have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, with measurement on initial recog\u00ad nition based on acquisition cost.\n\nOn 30. September 2021, the BMW Group signed an agree\u00ad ment with the Huachen Group to acquire all of the shares of Brilliance  Automobile  Manufacturing  Co,  Ltd.,  a  Huachen Group subsidiary. The acquisition includes land usage rights as well as buildings and production facilities of a Huachen Group vehicle plant at the Shenyang site. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022 after all the necessary regulatory approvals have been obtained.\n\nThe other changes to the Group reporting entity do not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial posi\u00ad tion and net assets of the Group.\n\n## 03   Increased shareholding in BMW Brilliance Automotive  Ltd.\n\nOn 11 February 2022, via the Group company BMW Holding B. V., the BMW Group increased its shareholding in the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BMW Brilliance) from 50 % to 75 % with the acquisition of a further 25 % of BMW Brilliance's shares. On 11 October 2018, the BMW Group signed an agreement with its joint venture partner, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (CBA), to acquire these shares. The agreement was approved at the CBA shareholders' meeting on 18 January 2019.\n\nThe previous joint venture requirement came to an end with effect  from  1  January  2022.  The  amended  joint  venture agreement came into force and the formal transfer of shares was completed on 11 February 2022, following the issuance of  an  amended  'business  license'.  Since  that  date,  the BMW Group has held a 75 % majority of the voting rights, as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na result of which it now has control over BMW Brilliance. BMW Brilliance will therefore be fully consolidated as a sub\u00ad sidiary in the BMW Group Financial Statements with effect from 11 February 2022. The contractual term of the joint ven\u00ad ture, which previously ran until 2028, has been extended to 2040.\n\nBMW Brilliance manufactures BMW brand models primarily for the Chinese market at its two vehicle production plants as well as petrol engines and high\u00advoltage batteries at a sepa\u00ad rate facility.\n\nThe  strategic  objective  of  the  acquisition  is  to  further strengthen the BMW Group's long\u00adterm collaboration with a partner  in  China,  to  expand  production  capacities  at  the existing locations in Shenyang and to systematically increase the local production of further models including New Energy Vehicles.\n\nSince the acquisition took place prior to the date on which the financial statements were approved for publication, this report contains disclosures relating to the business combi\u00ad nation, even though BMW Brilliance will not be fully consoli\u00ad dated until the financial year 2022.\n\nThe consideration paid for the additional 25 % stake totals \u20ac 3.7 billion, including hedging effects, and has been settled entirely in cash.\n\nCash and cash equivalents acquired totalled approximately \u20ac 8.7 billion.\n\nAs the BMW Group already held 50 % of the shares in BMW Brilliance prior to the acquisition, the transaction constitutes a business combination achieved in stages (step acquisi\u00ad tion).\n\nIn this context, the Group's 50 % shareholding in BMW Bril\u00ad liance at the acquisition date will be measured at fair value,",

The expected remeasurement gain of \u20ac 7 to 8 billion will be recognised in the financial year 2022 on the line item 'Result on investments' within the financial result.\n\nThe fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are currently in the process of being measured. The balance sheet values at 31 December 2021 are included in \u2197 note 24 . The remeasurement of acquired assets and liabilities will give rise primarily to the recognition of reacquired rights and dealership relationships as intangi\u00ad ble assets. Other fair value adjustments will also be recog\u00ad nised, mainly for property, plant and equipment and invento\u00ad ries. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date and the date on  which  these  financial  statements  were  authorised  for issue, further information is not yet available for disclosure and  will  be  provided  in  the  BMW Group's  next  quarterly statement. Adjustments to the fair value may also arise over the course of the financial year 2022 as the fair value meas\u00ad urement process is finalised.\n\nFollowing the business combination, minority interests in the equity capital of BMW Automotive Finance (China) Co. Ltd. and in Herald International Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. will change  to  10.5 %  in  each  case.

Under this method, assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate, whilst income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate. Differences arising on foreign currency trans\u00ad lation are presented in 'Accumulated other equity'.\n\nIn the single entity accounts of BMW AG and its subsidiaries, foreign currency receivables and payables are measured on initial recognition using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of first\u00adtime recognition. Advance payments to suppli\u00ad ers or from customers in a foreign currency that result in the addition of non\u00admonetary assets or liabilities are recorded at\n\nthe exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency receivables and payables are measured using the closing exchange rate. The resulting unrealised gains and losses, as well as realised gains and losses arising on settlement, are recognised in the income statement, in line with the underlying substance of the transaction. Non\u00admonetary balance sheet items denom\u00ad inated in foreign currencies are rolled forward on the basis of historical exchange rates.\n\nThe  exchange  rates  of  currencies  which  have  a  material impact on the Group Financial Statements were as follows:\n\n|                       | Closing rate              | Average rate   | Average rate   |    |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|----|\n| 1 Euro =              | 31. 12. 2021 31. 12. 2020 | 2021           | 2020           |    |\n| US Dollar 1.14        | 1.23                      | 1.18           | 1.14           |    |\n| British Pound 0.84    | 0.90                      | 0.86           | 0.89           |    |\n| Chinese Renminbi 7.22 | 8.00                      | 7.63           | 7.87           |    |\n| Russian Rouble 85.23  | 90.54                     | 87.18          | 82.71          |    |\n| Korean Won 1,351.64   | 1,329.79                  | 1,353.58       | 1,345.42       |    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amendments  contain  a  number  of  reliefs  to  mitigate  the impact on the accounting treatment of hedge relationships, financial instruments and lease liabilities resulting from the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nThe BMW Group is impacted by the reform of interest rate benchmarks primarily in the area of financial liabilities and related interest rate hedges. For a significant proportion of these instruments, the previous benchmark interest rate was replaced by an alternative interest rate in 2021.\n\nThe adoption of the rules contained in the amended Stand\u00ad ard means that the existing hedging relationships can be continued and the contractual changes arising due to the\n\n## b  Financial reporting pronouncements issued by the IASB, but not yet applied\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB published IFRS 17 Insurance Con\u00ad tracts.

Early adoption of IFRS 17 is not planned.\n\nSimilarly, other financial reporting standards issued by the IASB and not yet applied are not expected to have any sig\u00ad nificant impact on the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n\n## 06   Accounting policies, assumptions, judgements and estimations\n\nRevenues from customer contracts include in particular rev\u00ad enues from the sale of products (primarily new and pre\u00ad owned vehicles and related products) as well as revenues from services. Revenue is recognised when control is trans\u00ad ferred to the dealership or retail customer. In the case of sales of products, this is usually at the point in time when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Revenues are stated net of settlement discount, bonuses and rebates as well as interest and residual value subsidies. The consid\u00ad eration arising from these sales usually falls due for payment immediately or within 30 days. In exceptional cases, a longer payment may also be agreed. In the case of services, control is transferred over time. Consideration for the rendering of services to customers usually falls due for payment at the beginning of a contract and is therefore deferred as a con\u00ad tract liability. The deferred amount is released over the ser\u00ad vice period and recognised as revenue in the income state\u00ad ment. As a rule, amounts are released on the basis of the expected  expense  trend,  as  this  best  reflects  the  perfor\u00ad mance of the service. If the sale of products includes a deter\u00ad minable  amount  for  services  (multiple\u00adcomponent  con\u00ad tracts), the related revenues are deferred and recognised as income  in  the  same  way.  Variable  consideration  compo\u00ad nents,  such  as  bonuses,  are  measured  at  the  expected value, and in the case of multi\u00adcomponent contracts, allo\u00ad cated to all performance obligations unless directly attribut\u00ad able to the sale of a vehicle.",

Instead, revenues are either recognised proportion\u00ad ately or the difference between the sales and repurchase price is recognised in instalments over the term of the con\u00ad tract depending on the nature of the agreement. In the case of vehicles sold to a dealership that are expected to be repur\u00ad chased in a subsequent period as part of leasing operations, revenues are not recognised at Group level at the time of the sale of the vehicle. Instead, assets and liabilities relating to the right of return vehicles are recognised.\n\nRevenues  from  leases  of  own\u00admanufactured  vehicles  are recognised at Group level in accordance with the require\u00ad ments for manufacturer or dealer leases. In the case of oper\u00ad ating leases, revenues from lease payments are recognised on a straight\u00adline basis over the lease term.\n\nFinance leases, on the other hand, are accounted for as a sale. At the lease commencement date, revenues are recog\u00ad nised at the amount of the fair value of the leased asset and reduced by any unguaranteed residual value of vehicles that are expected to be returned to the Group at the end of the lease term. In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as cost of sales at the lease commencement date.\n\nRevenues also include interest income from financial ser\u00ad vices. Interest income arising on finance leases as well as on retail customer and dealership financing is recognised using the effective interest method and reported as interest income on credit financing within revenues.\n\nPublic sector grants are not recognised until there is rea\u00ad sonable  assurance  that  the  conditions  attaching  to  them have been complied with and the grants will be received. The resulting income is recognised in cost of sales over the peri\u00ad ods in which the costs occur that they are intended to com\u00ad pensate.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial   Statements\n\nEarnings per share are calculated as follows: Basic earn\u00ad ings  per  share  are  calculated  for  common  and  preferred stock by dividing the net profit for the year after minority interests and attributable to each category of stock, by the average number of outstanding shares. Net profit for the year is accordingly allocated to the different categories of stock. The portion of the net profit that is not being distrib\u00ad uted is allocated to each category of stock based on the number of outstanding shares. Profits available for distribu\u00ad tion are determined directly on the basis of the dividend pro\u00ad posals  or  resolutions  for  common  and  preferred  stock. Diluted earnings per share are calculated and separately disclosed in accordance with IAS 33.\n\nIntangible  assets are  measured  on  initial  recognition  at acquisition or manufacturing cost. Subsequently, intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight\u00adline basis over their useful lives of between three and 20 years. Impairment losses are recognised where necessary. Intangi\u00ad ble assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment. Internally generated intangible assets mainly comprise development costs for vehicle, module and archi\u00ad tecture projects.\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalised if all of the criteria spec\u00ad ified by IAS 38 are met. They are measured on the basis of direct costs and directly attributable overhead costs. Pro\u00ad ject\u00adrelated capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight\u00adline basis following the start of production over the estimated product life (usually five to twelve years).\n\nGoodwill arises  when  the  cost  of  acquiring  a  business exceeds the Group's share of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  identified  during  the acquisition.\n\nIntangible  assets  also  include emission  allowances and similar rights arising from programmes aimed at reducing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncarbon or other climate\u00addamaging emissions (for example in  conjunction  with  the  EU  Emissions  Trading  System  or vehicle\u00adrelated emissions regulations in the USA or China). These allowances and rights are carried at cost and, in the event that they are allocated free of charge, recorded at a value of zero. Amounts are derecognised at the date of the return, sale or expiry of the allowances or rights. In parallel to the recognition of these allowances and rights as assets, provisions are recognised in accordance with IAS 37 corre\u00ad sponding to the amount of obligations expected to arise in conjunction with the related emission regulations. Provisions are  measured  on  the  basis  of  the  expected  value  of  the allowances or rights that are to be returned.\n\nIf there is any indication of impairment of intangible assets , or if an annual impairment test is required (i. e. intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, intangible assets during the development phase and goodwill), an impairment test is performed. Each individual asset is tested separately unless the cash flows generated by the asset are not sufficiently independent from the cash flows generated by other assets or  other  groups  of  assets.  In  these  cases,  impairment  is tested at the level of a cash\u00adgenerating unit, which is the norm for the BMW Group.\n\nFor the purpose of the impairment test, the carrying amount of an asset (or a cash\u00adgenerating unit) is compared with the recoverable amount. The first step of the impairment test is to determine the value in use. If the value in use is lower than the carrying amount, the next step is to determine the fair value less costs to sell and compare the amount so deter\u00ad mined with the asset's carrying amount. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is rec\u00ad ognised, reducing the carrying amount to the higher of the asset's value in use or fair value less costs to sell.\n\nIf the reason for a previously recognised impairment loss no longer exists, the impairment loss is reversed up to the level",

Impairment  losses  on goodwill are not reversed.\n\nAs part of the process of assessing recoverability, it is gener\u00ad ally necessary to apply estimations and assumptions - in particular regarding future cash inflows and outflows and the length of the forecast period - which could differ from actual amounts. Actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and estimations used if business conditions develop differ\u00ad ently to expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group determines the value in use on the basis of a present value computation. Cash flows used for this calcu\u00ad lation  are  derived  from  long\u00adterm  forecasts  approved  by management.  These  long\u00adterm  forecasts  are  based  on detailed forecasts drawn up at an operational level, covering a planning period of six years. For the purposes of calculat\u00ad ing  cash  flows  beyond  the  planning  period,  a  perpetual annuity return is assumed which does not take growth into account. Forecasting assumptions are continually adjusted to current information and regularly compared with external sources. The assumptions used take account in particular of expectations  of  the  profitability  of  the  product  portfolio, future market share development, macroeconomic develop\u00ad ments (such as currency, interest rate and raw materials prices) as well as the legal environment and past experi\u00ad ence. Assumptions also take into account the impact of cli\u00ad mate change and the influence of other sustainability factors on  business  performance  and  the  product  portfolio,  for example as a result of changes in demand patterns, regula\u00ad tory requirements or changes in production conditions.\n\nAmounts are discounted on the basis of a market\u00adrelated cost  of  capital  rate.  Impairment  tests  are  performed  for accounting and financial reporting purposes for the Automo\u00ad tive and Motorcycles cash\u00adgenerating units using a risk\u00adad\u00ad justed pre\u00adtax cost of capital (WACC). In the case of the Financial Services cash\u00adgenerating unit, a pre\u00adtax cost of\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial   Statements\n\nequity capital is used, as is customary in the sector. The fol\u00ad lowing discount factors were applied:\n\n|   in % |   2021 | 2020               |\n|--------|--------|--------------------|\n|   10.1 |   10.2 | Automotive         |\n|   10.1 |   10.2 | Motorcycles        |\n|   13   |   13.2 | Financial Services |\n\nThe risk\u00adadjusted discount rate, calculated using a CAPM model, also takes into account specific peer\u00adgroup informa\u00ad tion relating to beta\u00adfactors, capital structure data and bor\u00ad rowing costs. In conjunction with the impairment tests for cash\u00adgenerating units, sensitivity analyses are performed for the  main  assumptions  in  order  to  rule  out  that  possible changes to the assumptions used to determine the recover\u00ad able amount would result in the requirement to recognise an impairment loss. Even in the case of a 10 % deterioration in the individual measurement assumptions, the need to rec\u00ad ognise an impairment loss did not arise.\n\nAll items of property, plant and equipment are measured at acquisition or manufacturing cost less accumulated depreci\u00ad ation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe cost of internally constructed plant and equipment com\u00ad prises all costs which are directly attributable to the manu\u00ad facturing process as well as an appropriate proportion of production\u00adrelated overheads. This includes production\u00adre\u00ad lated depreciation and amortisation as well as an appropri\u00ad ate proportion of administrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in acquisition or manufacturing cost unless they are directly attributable to the asset.

For machinery used in multiple\u00adshift operations, deprecia\u00ad tion rates are increased to account for the additional utilisa\u00ad tion. If there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and  equipment,  an  impairment  test  is  performed  as described above for intangible assets.\n\nIn the case of leased items of property, plant and equip\u00ad ment , a right\u00adof\u00aduse asset and a liability for the outstanding lease payments are recognised with effect from the date on which the leased asset becomes available for use by the BMW Group. The cost of the right\u00adof\u00aduse asset is the sum of the amount at which lease liability is initially measured, any lease payments made at or before the lease commence\u00ad ment date, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and the estimated costs of dismantling, removing or restoring the leased asset. Lease incentives granted by the lessor are deducted. Right\u00adof\u00aduse assets are depreciated on a straight\u00ad line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset  and  the  expected  lease  term.  If  ownership  of  the leased asset is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease payments, the right\u00adof\u00aduse asset is depreciated on a  straight\u00adline  basis  over  the  expected  useful  life  of  the leased asset. Right\u00adof\u00aduse assets are reported in the bal\u00ad\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial   Statements\n\nance sheet within the relevant line items for property, plant and equipment. The depreciation expense on right\u00adof\u00aduse assets is reported in the income statement in cost of sales as well as in selling and administrative expenses.\n\nThe lease liability is measured on initial recognition at the present value of the future lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced, without income statement impact, by the lease payments made. Lease liabilities are reported within financial liabili\u00ad ties, while interest expense is reported as part of net interest result. In the cash flow statement, both the repayment por\u00ad tion and the interest portion of lease payments are shown as cash outflows from financing activities.\n\nThe lease payments to be taken into account to measure the right\u00adof\u00aduse asset and the lease liability comprise fixed pay\u00ad ments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or an interest rate as well as amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees. If it is reasonably certain that a purchase or lease extension option will be exercised, the relevant payments are also included. Payments for peri\u00ad ods for which the lessee has an option to terminate a lease unilaterally are only included in the lease payments if it is reasonably certain that the termination option will not be exercised.  For  the  purposes  of  assessing  options,  the BMW Group takes account of all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exer\u00ad cise the option.\n\nIFRS 16 requires that lease payments are discounted as a general rule using the interest rate implicit in the lease. How\u00ad ever, since the interest rate in leases entered into by the BMW Group cannot readily be determined, amounts are dis\u00ad counted  on  the  basis  of  the  incremental  borrowing  rate, comprising the risk\u00adfree interest rate in the relevant currency for matching maturities plus a premium for the credit risk. Specific risks attached to an asset are generally not taken\n\ninto account, given that collateral received in the context of alternative financing arrangements is not relevant within the BMW Group.\n\nDetermining which items are to be counted as lease pay\u00ad ments - including the issue of the lease term underlying those payments - and which discount rate to apply involves using estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual outcomes.\n\nAs lessee, the BMW Group makes use of the application exemptions available for short\u00adterm leases and leases of low\u00advalue assets.\n\nThe BMW Group has not applied the exemptions available to lessees to account for COVID\u00ad19\u00adrelated rent concessions (amendments to IFRS 16 dated 28 May 2020 and 31 March 2021).\n\nGroup  products  recognised  by  BMW Group  entities  as leased products under operating leases are measured at manufacturing cost and all other leased products at acquisi\u00ad tion cost, in each case including initial direct costs. All leased products are depreciated over the period of the lease using the  straight\u00adline  method  down  to  their  expected  residual value.\n\nWhere  the  recoverable  amount  of  a  lease  exceeds  the asset's carrying amount, changes in residual value expecta\u00ad tions  are  recognised  by  adjusting  scheduled  depreciation prospectively over the remaining term of the lease. If the recoverable  amount  is  lower  than  the  asset's  carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised for the shortfall. A test is carried out at each balance sheet date to determine whether an impairment loss recognised in prior years no longer exists or has decreased. In such cases, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount, at a maximum up to the amount of the asset's amortised cost.",

Relevant factors to be considered include the trend in market prices and demand on the pre\u00adowned automobile market. The expected change in the drive\u00adsys\u00ad tem mix going forward, which is subject to continuous anal\u00ad ysis, is also taken into account. The BMW Group has devel\u00ad oped and implemented methods and processes that enable the sustainability aspects of residual value risks, particularly climate\u00adrelated factors, to be appropriately assessed and managed. Potential regulatory changes are also taken into account.  For  example,  upward  or  downward  adjustments can be made to residual values on the basis of a range of scenario analyses. The assumptions are based on internally available historical data and current market data as well as on forecasts of external institutions. Furthermore, assump\u00ad tions  are  regularly  validated  by  comparison  with  external data. Certain types of contracts require a high degree of judgement when deciding whether they give rise to operat\u00ad ing leases or finance receivables.\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method are\n\nmeasured - provided no impairment has been recognised at cost of investment adjusted for the Group's share of earn\u00ad ings and changes in equity capital. If there is any indication that an investment is impaired, an impairment test is per\u00ad formed on the basis of the discounted cash flow method. An indicator exists, for example, in the event of a serious short\u00ad fall compared to budget, the loss of an active market or if funds are required to avoid insolvency.\n\nWith the exception of lease receivables, financial assets are measured on initial recognition at their fair value. Financial assets include in particular other investments, receivables from sales financing, marketable securities and investment funds, derivative financial assets, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. As a general rule, initial recognition takes place as soon as the BMW Group becomes a party to a contract; in the case of standard purchases or sales of\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial   Statements\n\nnon\u00adderivative  financial  assets,  initial  recognition  takes place at the settlement date.\n\nDepending on the business model and the structure of con\u00ad tractual cash flows, financial assets are classified as meas\u00ad ured at amortised cost, at fair value through comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. The category 'measured at fair value through comprehensive income' at the BMW Group comprises mainly marketable securities and investment funds used for liquidity management purposes. Selected marketable securities and investment funds, money market funds within cash and cash equivalents as well as convertible bonds are recognised at fair value through profit or loss, as their contractual cash flows do not solely repre\u00ad sent payments of principal and interest.\n\nThe BMW Group does not make use of the option to meas\u00ad ure equity instruments at fair value through other compre\u00ad hensive income or debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe market values of financial instruments measured at fair value are determined on the basis of market information available at the balance sheet date, such as quoted prices or using appropriate measurement methods, in particular the discounted cash flow method.\n\nItems reported under other investments within the scope of IFRS 9 are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associ\u00ad ated companies that are not material to the BMW Group are also included in other investments.\n\nReceivables from sales financing are measured as a gen\u00ad eral rule at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nReceivables from sales financing also include finance lease receivables which are measured at the amount of the net\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninvestment in the lease. This balance sheet line item also includes operating lease receivables due at the end of the reporting period, while the related vehicles are reported as leased products.\n\nWith the exception of receivables from operating leases and trade  receivables,  the  BMW Group  applies  the  general approach described in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of financial assets. Under the general approach, loss allow\u00ad ances are measured on initial recognition on the basis of the expected 12\u00admonth credit loss (stage 1). If the credit loss risk at the end of the reporting period has increased significantly since initial recognition, the impairment allowance is meas\u00ad ured on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 - general approach). The measurement of the change in default risk is based on a comparison of the default risk at the date of initial recognition and at the end of the reporting period. The default risk at the end of each reporting period is determined on the basis of credit checks, current key perfor\u00ad mance indicators and any overdue payments.\n\nThe BMW Group applies the simplified approach described in IFRS 9 to operating lease and trade receivables, whereby the amount of the loss allowance is measured subsequent to the initial recognition of the receivable on the basis of life\u00ad time expected credit losses (stage 2 - simplified approach). For the purposes of allocating at item to stage 2, it is irrele\u00ad vant whether the credit risk of the assets concerned has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nAs a general rule, the BMW Group assumes that a receivable is in default if it is more than 90 days overdue or if there are objective indications of insolvency, such as the opening of insolvency proceedings. Credit\u00adimpaired assets are identi\u00ad fied as such on the basis of this definition of default. In the case of credit\u00adimpaired assets which had not been credit\u00adim\u00ad paired  at  the  time  they  were  acquired  or  originated,  an impairment allowance is recognised at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (stage 3). This is the case",

In the case of stage 3 assets, interest income is cal\u00ad culated on the asset's carrying amount less any impairment loss.\n\nThe BMW Group derecognises financial assets when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery. This may be the case, for instance, if the debtor is deemed not to have sufficient assets or other sources of income to service the debt.\n\nLoss allowances relating to the balance sheet item 'Receiv\u00ad ables from sales financing' are determined primarily on the basis of past experience with credit losses, current data on overdue receivables, rating classes and scoring information.\n\nForward\u00adlooking information (for instance forecasts of key performance indicators) is also taken into account if, based on past experience, such indicators show a substantive cor\u00ad relation to actual credit losses.\n\nLoss allowances on trade receivables are determined pri\u00ad marily  on  the  basis  of  information  relating  to  overdue amounts. Furthermore, both positive and negative economic scenarios are used alongside the latest forecasts of key per\u00ad formance indicators when determining the level of valuation allowances. These scenarios are based on local analyses and take into account, for example, anticipated political and economic developments as well as sustainability risks in the markets concerned.\n\nInput factors available on the market, such as ratings and probabilities of default, are used to calculate valuation allow\u00ad ances for cash and cash equivalents, financial receivables, receivables from subsidiaries and receivables from compa\u00ad nies in which an investment is held. In the case of marketa\u00ad ble securities and investment funds, the BMW Group usually applies the option not to allocate financial assets with a low default risk to different stages. Accordingly, assets with an investment grade rating are always allocated to stage 1.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial   Statements\n\nDerivative  financial  instruments are  used  within  the BMW Group for hedging purposes in order to reduce cur\u00ad rency, interest rate, fair value and market price risks. Deriva\u00ad tive  financial  instruments  are  recognised  as  of  the  trade date, measured at their fair value. Depending on their market value at measurement date, these financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet as financial assets or financial liabilities.\n\nFair values are determined on the basis of valuation models. Observable market price, tenor and currency basis spreads are  taken  into  account  in  the  measurement  of  derivative financial instruments. Furthermore, the Group's own credit risk and that of counterparties is taken into account on the basis of credit default swap values for market contracts with matching terms.\n\nThe BMW Group applies the option to recognise the credit risks arising from the fair values of a group of derivative financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their total net amount. Portfolio\u00adbased valuation adjustments (credit valu\u00ad ation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments) to the individual derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are  allocated  using  the  relative  fair  value  approach  (net method).\n\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, changes in fair value of derivative  financial  instruments  are  presented  as  part  of other financial result in the income statement or within other comprehensive  income  as  a  component  of  accumulated other equity, depending on whether the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\n\nFair value hedges are mainly used to hedge interest rate risks relating to financial liabilities. The currency basis is not designated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of cross  currency  interest  rate  hedges  accounted  for  as  fair value hedges. Accordingly, changes in the market value of such components are recorded as costs of hedging within\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naccumulated other equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to other financial result within the income statement over the term of the hedging relationship.\n\nIn addition, for selected fixed\u00adinterest assets, a portion of the interest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis in accordance with  IAS  39.  The  designated  hedged  items  (underlying transactions) are reported in the balance sheet as receiva\u00ad bles from sales financing or financial liabilities. Interest rate risks are hedged on the basis of the present value of net cash  flows  relating  to  fixed\u00adincome  assets  (on  the  asset side) less cash flows relating to variable\u00adrate financing (on the liabilities side). The net cash flow determined in this way is hedged by purchasing corresponding interest rate swaps that have the effect of reducing the interest rate risk. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a monthly basis  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  thereby  taking account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\n\nFair value hedge ineffectiveness is generally recognised in other financial result.\n\nThe time values of option transactions and the interest com\u00ad ponent - including the currency basis - of forward currency contracts are not designated as part of the hedging relation\u00ad ship in the case of currency hedges accounted for as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of such components are recorded as costs of hedging on a separate line within accumulated other equity. Amounts recorded in accumulated other equity from currency hedges are reclassified to cost of sales when the related hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIn the case of raw materials hedges that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the hedging instruments are designated in full as part of the hedging relationship. As an exception to this general rule, the interest component of raw materials deriva\u00ad tive instruments redesignated in conjunction with the first\u00ad time application IFRS 9 was not designated as part of the",

Changes in the fair value of this compo\u00ad nent are recorded as costs of hedging on a separate line within accumulated other equity. Amounts recorded in accu\u00ad mulated other equity are included in the carrying amount of inventories on initial recognition.\n\nIneffectiveness  arising  on  cash  flow  hedges  is  recognised directly in cost of sales, whereas the impact of prematurely ter\u00ad minated hedging relationships is recognised in other operating income and expenses.\n\nDeferred income taxes are recognised for all temporary differ\u00ad ences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and liabilities, including differences arising on consolidation proce\u00ad dures, as well as on unused tax losses and unused tax credits, when it is probable that they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed at each balance sheet date on the basis of planned taxable income in future financial years. If with a probability of more than 50 per\u00ad cent future tax benefits will not be realised, either in part or in total, a valuation allowance is recognised on the deferred tax assets. The calculation of deferred tax assets requires assump\u00ad tions to be made with regard to the level of future taxable income and the timing of recovery of deferred tax assets.\n\nThese assumptions take account of forecast operating results, future legislative changes in connection with climate change and the impact on earnings of the reversal of taxable tempo\u00ad rary differences. Since future business developments cannot be predicted with certainty and to some extent cannot be influenced by the BMW Group, the measurement of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial   Statements\n\nDeferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences aris\u00ad ing from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associ\u00ad ated companies as well as interests in joint arrangements are not recognised if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. This is particularly the case if it is intended that profits will not be distributed, but rather will be used to maintain the substance and expand the volume of business of the entities concerned.\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated within the BMW Group on the basis of tax legislation applicable in the relevant coun\u00ad tries. To the extent that judgement was necessary to deter\u00ad mine the treatment and amount of tax items presented in the financial statements, there is in principle a possibility that local tax authorities may take a different position.\n\nAs a general rule, each income tax treatment is considered independently when accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. If it is not considered probable that an income tax treatment will be accepted by the local tax authorities, the BMW Group uses the most likely amount of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit and the tax base.\n\nInventories of raw materials, supplies and goods for resale are stated at the lower of average acquisition cost and net realisable value.\n\nWork in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of manufacturing cost and net realisable value. Manufactur\u00ad ing cost comprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manufacturing process as well as an appropriate propor\u00ad tion of production\u00adrelated overheads. This includes produc\u00ad tion\u00adrelated depreciation and amortisation and an appropri\u00ad ate proportion of administrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in the acquisition or manufacturing cost of inventories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInventories also include vehicles held for sale in the financial services business, measured at their amortised cost or lower net realisable value.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise mainly cash on hand and cash at bank with an original term of up to three months. With the exception of money market funds, cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.\n\nFinancial liabilities, with the exception of lease liabilities, are measured on first\u00adtime recognition at their fair value. For these purposes, transaction costs are taken into account except in the case of financial liabilities allocated to the cat\u00ad egory 'measured at fair value through profit or loss'. Subse\u00ad quent to initial recognition, liabilities are - with the exception of derivative financial instruments - measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nProvisions for pensions are measured using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, not only obligations relating to known vested benefits at the reporting date are recognised, but also the effect of future expected increases in pensions and salaries. The calculation is based on inde\u00ad pendent actuarial valuations which take into account the rel\u00ad evant biometric factors.\n\nIn the case of funded plans, the pension obligation is offset against plan assets measured at their fair value. If the plan assets exceed the pension obligation, the surplus is tested for recoverability.\n\nIn the event that the BMW Group has a right of reimburse\u00ad ment or a right to reduce future contributions, it reports an asset (within Other financial assets), measured on the basis of the present value of the future economic benefits attached to the plan assets. For funded plans, in cases where the obli\u00ad gation exceeds plan assets, a liability is recognised under pension provisions.",

Provisions with a remaining period of more than one year are measured at their net present value.\n\nThe measurement of provisions for statutory and non\u00adstat\u00ad utory  warranty  obligations  (statutory,  contractual  and voluntary) involves estimations. In addition to manufacturer warranties prescribed by law, the BMW Group offers various further standard (assurance\u00adtype) warranties depending on the product and sales market. No provisions are recognised for additionally offered service packages that are treated as separate performance obligations.\n\nProvisions  for  statutory  and  non\u00adstatutory  warranties  are recognised at the point in time when control over the goods is transferred to the dealership or retail customer or when it is decided to introduce new warranty measures. With respect to the level of the provision, estimations are made in particu\u00ad lar based on past experience of damage claims and pro\u00ad cesses. Future potential repair costs and price increases per product and market are also taken into account. Provisions for  warranties  for  all  companies  of  the  BMW Group  are adjusted regularly to take account of new information, with the impact of any changes recognised in the income state\u00ad ment. Further information is provided in \u2197 note 33 . Similar esti\u00ad mates are also made in conjunction with the measurement of expected reimbursement claims.\n\nThe recognition and measurements of provisions for litiga\u00ad tion and liability risks necessitates making assumptions in order to determine the probability of liability, the amount of claim and the duration of the legal dispute. The assumptions made, especially the assumption about the outcome of legal proceedings, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.

Revenues from the sales of products previously leased to customers, income\n\nfrom lease instalments and interest income on loan financ\u00ad ing and finance leases are allocated to the Financial Ser\u00ad vices segment.\n\nSundry other income relates mainly to the Automotive seg\u00ad ment and the Financial Services segment.\n\nThe  major  part  of  revenues  expected  to  arise  from  the Group's order book at the end of the reporting period relates to the sale of vehicles. Revenues resulting from those sales will be recognised in the next financial year.\n\nThe services included in vehicle sale contracts that will be recognised as revenues in subsequent years represent only an insignificant portion of expected revenues. Accordingly, use has been made of the practical expedient contained in IFRS 15, permitting an entity not to disclose information on a quantitative basis due to the short\u00adterm nature of items and the lack of informational value of such disclosures.\n\nInterest  income  on  loan  financing  and  finance  leases includes  interest  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  effective interest method totalling \u20ac 3,379 million (2020: \u20ac 3,424 mil\u00ad lion). This interest income is not reported separately in the income statement as it is not significant compared to total Group revenues.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\n## 08  Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales comprises:\n\n| in \u20ac million                                                        | 2021 2020                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                                                     | Manufacturing costs 51,361 46,878 |\n| Cost of sales relating to financial  services  business             | 26,409 27,114                     |\n| thereof: interest expense relating   to financial services business | 1,643 1,960                       |\n| Research and development expenses                                   | 6,299 5,689                       |\n| Expenses for service contracts,  telematics and roadside assistance | 1,591 1,411                       |\n| Warranty expenditure                                                | 2,192 2,971                       |\n| Other cost of sales                                                 | 1,401 1,345                       |\n| Cost of sales                                                       | 89,253 85,408                     |\n\nCost of sales is reduced by public\u00adsector subsidies in the form  of  reduced  taxes  on  assets  and  reduced  consump\u00ad tion\u00adbased  taxes  amounting  to  \u20ac  118 million  (2020: \u20ac 105 million).\n\nImpairment losses recognised in the income statement 2021 in connection  with  receivables  from  sales  financing amounted to \u20ac 103 million (2020: \u20ac 646 million).

Income from the reversal of provisions includes income arising on the reassessment of risks from legal disputes.\n\nIn 2019, a provision of approximately \u20ac 1.4 billion was recog\u00ad nised in connection with EU Commission anti\u00adtrust proceed\u00ad ings  which  resulted  in  an  increase  in  other  operating expenses in the financial year 2019 (see also \u2197 note 10 to the BMW Group  Financial  Statements  for  the  financial  year 2019). In this antitrust investigation, the EU Commission had alleged that five German car manufacturers colluded with the aim of restricting competition for innovation with regards to certain exhaust treatment systems for petrol\u00ad and die\u00ad sel\u00addriven passenger vehicles. The investigation was solely concerned with possible infringements of competition law. There were no allegations that the BMW Group conducted a deliberate and unlawful manipulation of the emissions con\u00ad trol system. On the basis of BMW AG's detailed submissions, the EU Commission dropped most of its charges. The pro\u00ad ceedings were settled on 8 July 2021, and a fine amounting to approximately \u20ac 373 million was issued.\n\nIn the opinion of the EU Commission, the carmakers con\u00ad cerned - within the framework of what was actually legiti\u00ad mate technical cooperation in the development of SCR tech\u00ad nology  (SCR:  selective  catalytic  reduction)  -  created  an undue degree of transparency with regard to the sizes of their AdBlue tanks, the range that can be achieved with a full tank  and  the  assumed  average  AdBlue  consumption, thereby violating EU competition law. The amount of the pro\u00ad vision exceeding the fine was reversed with income state\u00ad ment effect in the year under report. The fine was paid in July 2021, thereby concluding the EU Commission's proceedings.",

        "page_content": "## Group  Financial Statements\n\nTax loss  carryforwards relating  to  Germany  and  foreign operations amounted to \u20ac 4,138 million (2020: \u20ac 1,568 mil\u00ad lion). This includes one tax\u00adloss carryforward amounting to \u20ac  413 million (2020: \u20ac  406 million), on which a valuation allowance of \u20ac 140 million (2020: \u20ac 138 million) was recog\u00ad nised on the related deferred tax asset.\n\nFor entities with tax losses available for carryforward, a net surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities is reported amounting to \u20ac 2,487 million (2020: \u20ac 392 million). The  basis  for  the  recognition  of  deferred  taxes  is  the BMW Group business model or management's assessment that there is material evidence that the entities will generate future taxable profit, against which deductible temporary dif\u00ad ferences can be offset. The increase in tax loss carryfor\u00ad wards was mainly attributable to the exercise of a tax option by  the  BMW Group's  US  companies.  Furthermore,  it  is assumed that tax start\u00adup losses relating to the San Luis Potos\u00ed plant in Mexico, opened in 2019, can be utilised by offset against planned future profits.\n\nLoss  carryforwards  amounting  to  \u20ac  3,834 million  (2020: \u20ac 1,129 million) can be used indefinitely, while \u20ac 304 million (2020: \u20ac 439 million) expire after more than 3 years.\n\nCapital losses available for carryforward in the United King\u00ad dom which do not relate to ongoing operations increased to \u20ac 1,959 million (2020: \u20ac 1,832 million) due to currency fac\u00ad tors. As in previous years, deferred tax assets recognised on these tax losses - which increased to \u20ac 490 million due to a tax rate change in the UK (2020: \u20ac 348 million) - were fully written down since they can only be utilised against future capital gains.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted for each relevant tax entity if they relate to the same tax author\u00ad ities.\n\nDeferred  taxes  recognised  directly  in  equity  amounted  to \u20ac 1,733 million (2020: \u20ac 1,710 million).\n\n| in \u20ac million                                                                                                                      | 2021        | 2020                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Deferred taxes at 1 January (assets (+) / liabilities (-))                                                                        | 1,950 1,562 |                                                                                             |\n| Deferred tax expense (-) / income (+) recognised through income statement                                                         | - 1,085 658 |                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                   | 23 - 305    | Change in deferred taxes recognised directly in equity                                      |\n| thereof relating to fair value gains and losses on financial instruments and marketable securities recognised  directly in equity | 247 - 443   |                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                   | - 250 161   | thereof relating to the remeasurements of net liabilities for defined benefit pension plans |\n| 26                                                                                                                                | - 23        | thereof from currency translation                                                           |\n| - 144                                                                                                                             | 35          | Exchange rate impact and other changes                                                      |\n| 744                                                                                                                               | 1,950       | Deferred taxes at 31 December (assets (+) / liabilities (-))                                |\n\nTaxable  temporary  differences  relating  to  investments  in subsidiaries,  associated  companies  and  joint  ventures amount  to  \u20ac  25,526 million  (2020:  \u20ac  22,174 million).  No deferred taxes are recognised on these taxable temporary differences because the BMW Group is able to determine the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future, in particular in view of the fact that there is no intention to distribute the profits, but rather to use them to maintain their substance and reinvest in the compa\u00ad nies concerned. No computation was made of the potential impact of income taxes on the grounds of proportionality. Deferred  tax  liabilities  on  expected  dividends  amount  to \u20ac 79 million (2020: \u20ac 76 million) and relate primarily to divi\u00ad dends from foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.\n\nThe tax returns of BMW Group entities are checked regularly by German and foreign tax authorities. Taking account of numerous factors - including interpretations, commentaries and legal decisions relating to the various tax jurisdictions as well  as  past  experience  -  adequate  provision  has  been made, to the extent identifiable and probable, for potential future tax obligations.",

Preferred stock, to which no voting rights are  attached,  bear  an  additional  dividend  of  \u20ac  0.02  per share.\n\nIn 2021, a total of 1,718,070 shares of preferred stock was sold to employees at a reduced price of \u20ac 60.78 per share in conjunction  with  an  Employee  Share  Programme.  These shares are entitled to receive dividends for the first time with effect from the financial year 2022.\n\nIssued share capital increased by \u20ac 1.7 million as a result of the issue to employees of 1,715,000 new shares of non\u00advot\u00ad ing preferred stock. BMW AG is authorised up to 15 May 2024 to  issue  5 million  shares  of  non\u00advoting  preferred  stock amounting to nominal \u20ac 5.0 million. At the end of the report\u00ad ing  period,  1.7 million  of  these  amounting  to  nominal \u20ac 1.7 million remained available for issue.\n\nIn addition, 3.070 previously issued shares of preferred stock were acquired and re\u00adissued to employees.\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nCapital reserves include premiums arising from the issue of shares and totalled \u20ac 2,325 million (2020: \u20ac 2,199 million). The change amounting to \u20ac 126 million related to the share capital increase in conjunction with the issue of shares of preferred stock to employees.\n\n## Revenue reserves\n\nRevenue reserves comprise the non\u00addistributed earnings of companies consolidated in the Group Financial Statements. In addition, remeasurements of the net defined benefit obli\u00ad gation  for  pension  plans  are  also  presented  in  revenue reserves.\n\nIt is proposed that the unappropriated profit of BMW AG for the financial year 2021 amounting to \u20ac 3,827 million be uti\u00ad lised as follows:\n\n- - Distribution of a dividend of \u20ac 5.82 per share of preferred stock (\u20ac 336 million)\n- - Distribution of a dividend of \u20ac 5.80 per share of common stock (\u20ac 3,491 million)\n\nThe proposed distribution was not recognised as a liability in the Group Financial Statements.\n\n## Group  Financial Statements\n\nNotes to the Group Financial  Statements\n\n## Accumulated other equity\n\nAccumulated other equity comprises amounts recognised directly in equity resulting from the translation of the finan\u00ad cial statements of foreign subsidiaries, changes in the fair value  of  derivative  financial  instruments  and  marketable securities, costs of hedging recognised directly in equity as well the related deferred taxes.\n\n## Capital management disclosures\n\nThe BMW Group's objectives with regard to capital manage\u00ad ment are to safeguard over the long\u00adterm the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide an adequate return to shareholders.\n\nThe capital structure is managed in order to meet needs arising from changes in economic conditions and the risks of the underlying assets.\n\nThe BMW Group is not subject to any unified external mini\u00ad mum equity capital requirements. Within the Financial Ser\u00ad vices segment, however, there are a number of individual entities which are subject to equity capital requirements of relevant regulatory banking authorities.\n\nIn  order  to  manage  its  capital  structure,  the  BMW Group uses various instruments, including the amount of dividends paid  to  shareholders  and  share  buybacks.  Moreover,  the BMW Group  actively  manages  debt  capital,  carrying  out funding activities with a target debt structure in mind. A key aspect in the selection of financial instruments is the objec\u00ad tive to achieve matching maturities for the Group's financing requirements. In order to reduce non\u00adsystematic risk, the BMW Group uses a variety of financial instruments available on the world's capital markets to achieve diversification.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Defined benefit plans may be covered by provisions or pension assets. In Germany, pension obliga\u00ad tions of the BMW Group are mostly covered by assets trans\u00ad ferred to BMW Trust e. V., Munich, in conjunction with a Con\u00ad tractual  Trust  Arrangement  (CTA)  (funded  plan).  Funded plans also exist in the UK, the USA, Switzerland, Belgium and Japan. In the meantime, most of the defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\nThe assumptions stated below, which depend on the eco\u00ad nomic situation in the relevant country, are used to measure the defined benefit obligation of each pension plan.

The level of ongoing pension payments is adjusted in accordance with \u00a7 16 of the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz).\n\nThe defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants since 2014. Defined contribution plans with a minimum rate of return, comprising employer\u00ad and employee\u00adfunded com\u00ad ponents, continue to exist. The fact that the plan involves a minimum rate of return means that the defined contribution entitlements  are  classified  in  accordance  with  IAS  19  as defined benefit plans.

The Board of Directors is responsible for investments, drawing up and deciding on investment guidelines as well as monitoring compliance with those guidelines. The members of the association can be employees, employee representa\u00ad tives, senior executives and members of the Board of Man\u00ad agement of BMW AG. An ordinary Members' General Meet\u00ad ing takes place once every calendar year, and deals with a range  of  matters,  including  receiving  and  approving  the association's  annual  report,  ratifying  the  activities  of  the\n\nBoard of Directors and adopting changes to the associa\u00ad tion's statutes.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nDefined benefit plans exist in the United Kingdom which are closed for all plan participants. Vested benefits remain in place. New benefits are covered by contributions made to a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans are administered by BMW Pension  Trustees  Limited,  Farnborough,  and  BMW  (UK) Trustees  Limited,  Farnborough,  both  trustee  companies which act independently of the BMW Group. BMW (UK) Trus\u00ad tees Limited, Farnborough, is represented by ten trustees and BMW Pension Trustees Limited, Farnborough, by five trustees. A minimum of one third of the trustees must be elected  by  plan  participants.  The  trustees  represent  the interests  of  plan  participants  and  decide  on  investment strategies.  Funding  contributions  to  the  funds  are  deter\u00ad mined in agreement with the BMW Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The fixed amounts to which  employees  were  previously  entitled  in  the  defined benefit plan remain unchanged going forward and therefore this  is  one  factor  which  results  in  a  plan  amendment  in accordance with IAS 19. The previous pension entitlement trend (Festbetragstrend) was converted - with the exception of one remaining component - into a career trend. Further\u00ad more,  an  employee  switching  to  the  defined  contribution plan received an entitlement deemed to be equivalent in legal terms to their previous rights.\n\nThis gave rise to an overall positive impact of \u20ac 562 million on past service cost, which was recognised in the income statement, primarily in the form of reductions to cost of sales as well as to selling and administrative expenses.\n\nActuarial gains arising in the financial year 2021 resulted in a surplus of plan assets over liabilities for one of the pension plans in the United Kingdom. However, because there is no right of reimbursement or right to reduce future contributions to the fund, the amount of plan assets recognised has been limited to the amount of the obligations.\n\nIn the previous financial year, employment contract termina\u00ad tion agreements were agreed with employees, resulting in the persons concerned leaving the BMW Group with vested pension benefits. Past service cost resulted mainly from dif\u00ad fering assumptions used to calculate statutory pension enti\u00ad tlements on the one hand and for the ongoing accounting for active employees on the other.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\n<!-- image -->",

The discount rates used to cal\u00ad culate pension obligations are subject to market fluctuations and therefore influence the level of the obligations. Further\u00ad more,  changes  in  other  actuarial  parameters,  such  as expected rates of inflation, also have an impact on pension obligations. In order to reduce currency exposures, a sub\u00ad stantial portion of plan assets is either invested in the same currency as the underlying plan or hedged by means of cur\u00ad rency derivatives. As part of the internal reporting proce\u00ad dures and for internal management purposes, financial risks relating to the pension plans are reported using a value\u00adat\u00ad risk approach by reference to the pension deficit. The invest\u00ad ment strategy is also subject to regular review together with external consultants, with the aim of ensuring that invest\u00ad ments are structured to match the timing of pension pay\u00ad ments and the expected development of pension obliga\u00ad tions.

The calculation of sensitivities using ranges other than those specified could result in a disproportional change in the defined benefit obli\u00ad gation.\n\nIn the UK, the sensitivity analysis for the pension level trend also takes account of restrictions due to caps and floors.\n\n| Discount rate             | increase of 0.75 %  decrease of 0.75 %   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                           | increase of 0.25 %                       |\n| Pension level trend       | decrease of 0.25 %                       |\n| Average life expectancy   | decrease of 1 year                       |\n|                           | increase of 0.25 %                       |\n| Pension entitlement trend | decrease of 0.25 %                       |\n|                           | increase of 0.10 %                       |\n| Career trend              | decrease of 0.10 %                       |\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\n## Change in defined benefit obligation\n\n|              | 31. 12. 2021 31. 12. 2020   | 31. 12. 2021 31. 12. 2020   | 31. 12. 2021 31. 12. 2020   |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| in \u20ac million | in %                        | in \u20ac million                | in %                        |\n| - 2,650      | - 10.6                      | - 3,514                     | - 13.2                      |\n| 3,311        | 13.2                        | 4,585                       | 17.2                        |\n| 610          | 2.4                         | 766                         | 2.9                         |\n| - 586        | - 2.3                       | - 721                       | - 2.7                       |\n| 896          | 3.6                         | 1,078                       | 4.1                         |\n| - 910        | - 3.6                       | - 1,081                     | - 4.1                       |\n| 3            | -                           | 218                         | 0.8                         |\n| - 3          | -                           | - 210                       | - 0.8                       |\n| 63           | -                           | -                           | -                           |\n| - 62         | -                           | -                           | -                           |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Expected reimbursement  claims  at 31 December 2021 amounted to \u20ac 1,112 million (2020: \u20ac 1,046 million) and are disclosed within other assets (see \u2197 note 28 ).\n\nProvisions for obligations for personnel and social expenses comprise mainly obligations relating to performance\u00adrelated remuneration components, workforce measures as well as\n\npre\u00adretirement part\u00adtime working arrangements and long\u00adservice awards.\n\nThe provisions for other obligations cover numerous specific risks and uncertain obligations, in particular for litigation and liability risks. Further information on the reversal of the pro\u00ad vision relating to EU Commission antitrust proceedings is provided in \u2197 note 10 .\n\nOther obligations for ongoing operational expenses include in particular expected payments for bonuses and other price deductions.\n\n## 34  Income tax liabilities\n\nCurrent income tax liabilities totalling \u20ac  921 million (2020: \u20ac 747 million) include \u20ac 44 million (2020: \u20ac 40 million) which are expected to be settled after more than twelve months. Liabilities may be settled earlier than this depending on the timing of the underlying proceedings.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\n<!-- image -->",

These cash outflows relate to periods of up to 62 years (2020: up to 74 years). The decrease in the period under report was due to a contractual adjust\u00ad ment.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial  Statements\n\n## 31. 12. 2021\n\n## 31. 12. 2020\n\n<!-- image -->",

This assessment may change over time and is adjusted regularly on the basis of new information and circumstances. A part of the risks is covered by insurance.\n\nThe EU Commission's antitrust proceedings (see \u2197 note 10 for additional information) was settled on 8 July 2021. In relation to these allegations, numerous class action lawsuits have\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\nbeen brought in the USA and Canada as well as several pri\u00ad vate lawsuits in South Korea. In the USA, the customer class actions were withdrawn and the dealer class action was dis\u00ad missed.\n\nThe class action lawsuits in Canada and the private lawsuits in South Korea remain at an early stage. Further civil law\u00ad suits based on the allegations are possible going forward.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Chinese  State  Administration  for  Market Regulation opened antitrust proceedings against BMW AG in March 2019, followed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission in May 2020 and the Turkish Competition Authority in July 2020.\n\nWith respect to the Korean investigation, BMW AG recog\u00ad nised a provision during the financial year. The Turkish anti\u00ad trust authority issued its decision in January 2022, abstain\u00ad ing from issuing a fine. Possible risks for the BMW Group in connection with the antitrust proceedings in China cannot be currently foreseen, either in terms of their outcome nor the amounts involved. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nRegulatory authorities have ordered the BMW Group to recall various vehicle models in conjunction with airbags supplied by the Takata group of companies. Provision for the costs involved has been recognised within warranty provisions. In addition to the risks already covered by warranty provisions, further  BMW Group  vehicles  may  possibly  be  affected  by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfuture recall actions going forward. Further disclosures pur\u00ad suant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at the present time.\n\nOn 22 January 2020, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Com\u00ad mission (SEC) opened an investigation into possible viola\u00ad tions of U. S. securities laws by the BMW Group relating to disclosures  regarding  the  BMW Group's  unit  sales  of  new vehicles. This matter was settled with the SEC, without admit\u00ad ting  or  denying  the  allegations,  and  the  BMW Group  con\u00ad sented to the entry of an Order finding violations of the U. S. Securities Act and agreed to pay a penalty of US $ 18 million. Certain BMW Group entities and their officers are defendants in private securities litigation following the SEC Order. Possi\u00ad ble risks for the BMW Group cannot be quantified at present. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\n## Other financial commitments\n\nIn addition to liabilities, provisions and contingent liabilities, the following commitments exist for the BMW Group at the end of the reporting period:\n\n| in \u20ac million                                            | 31. 12. 2021   | 31. 12. 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Purchase commitments for property,  plant and equipment | 3,350          | 3,264          |\n| Purchase commitments for  intangible assets             | 2,190          | 2,787          |",

For the purposes of fair value measurement using  the  discounted  cash  flow  method,  expected  future cash flows are discounted on the basis of up\u00adto\u00addate interest curves observable on the market.\n\nThe fair values of receivables from sales financing are meas\u00ad ured using the discounted cash flow method, taking into account customer\u00adspecific credit risk. In view of the fact that these allowances are calculated in part on the basis of inter\u00ad nal information, receivables from sales financing are allo\u00ad cated to Level 3 in the level hierarchy in accordance with\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\nIFRS 13. The fair values of the financial assets shown in the table exist with financial institutions and are also measured using the discounted cash flow method, taking into account the risk of default. Given that these financial institutions all have excellent credit ratings, the risk of default is low and can be observed on the market. The fair values of these items are therefore allocated to Level 2.\n\nIn the case of financial liabilities, own credit risk is taken into account based on credit default swaps available on the mar\u00ad ket, so that the fair values of these items are also allocated to Level 2.\n\nFor all other financial instruments not listed here that are measured  at  amortised  cost,  the  carrying  amount  corre\u00ad sponds to the fair value. For this reason, they are not pre\u00ad sented separately.\n\n|                                                                 | 31. 12. 2021   | 31. 12. 2021     | 31. 12. 2020   | 31. 12. 2020     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| in \u20ac million                                                    | Fair value     | Carrying  amount | Fair value     | Carrying  amount |\n| Receivables from sales financing - credit financing             | 67,158         | 64,795           | 65,326         | 63,104           |\n| Receivables from sales financing - finance and operating leases | 24,675         | 22,622           | 23,116         | 21,173           |\n| Financial assets - Marketable securities and investment funds   | 20             | 20               | 116            | 115              |\n| Financial liabilities                                           |                |                  |                |                  |\n| Bonds                                                           | 53,022         | 51,498           | 58,136         | 56,665           |\n| Asset\u00adbacked financing transactions                              | 19,602         | 19,362           | 18,818         | 18,819           |\n| Liabilities from customer deposits (banking)                    | 16,732         | 16,702           | 16,599         | 16,466           |\n| Liabilities to banks                                            | 9,177          | 9,079            | 9,209          | 9,037            |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The fair values of these financial instruments are shown in the following table:\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 31. 12. 2021  Fair value   | 31.12.2020  Fair value                 |\n|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 724            | 397                        | Unquoted equity instruments            |\n| 23             | 22                         | Convertible bonds                      |\n| -              | 3                          | Options on unquoted equity instruments |\n| 67             | - 5                        | Derivative instruments                 |\n\nFinancial instruments allocated to Level 3 relate mainly to investments  in  a  private\u00adequity  fund.  The  valuation  of unlisted equity instruments is determined primarily using the market\u00adbased approach. In particular, the financing rounds that take place within the private equity sector - usually on a regular basis at intervals of approximately 12 to 24 months - represent a significant input factor for these purposes. In addition, the investment advisor provides the external fund manager with relevant, investment\u00adspecific information on an ongoing basis (at least quarterly). The latter subsequently assesses the underlying individual companies in accordance with the guidelines for International Private Equity and Ven\u00ad ture Capital Valuations (IPEV).\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\nAs part of the process of analysing valuations, the external fund manager reviews the investment\u00adspecific milestones, including an analysis of financial, technical and liquidity\u00adspe\u00ad cific performance indicators. Based on this analysis, it is considered whether the price of the most recent financing round is acceptable as a reasonable market valuation, in particular for early\u00adstage or growth\u00adphase investments. Key performance indicators used for the purpose of milestone analysis are highly dependent on the business model under\u00ad lying the investment. Typical technical key performance indi\u00ad cators relate to licenses and patents held, the stage of tech\u00ad nology  development  such  as  evidence  of  feasibility  and prototypes, market entries, customer and user growth and appointments to key management positions. Key financial performance indicators used are revenues, EBITDA and the corresponding growth rate and / or development of specific contribution  margins.  Key  liquidity\u00adspecific  performance indicators are cash on hand, cash burn rates and prospects for future financing rounds.\n\nSince the pricing from the financing rounds is considered to be the decisive input factor for the valuation, increases or decreases in valuation give rise to a similar change in the equity instrument that is recognised in the income state\u00ad ment.\n\nIn addition, equity instruments that are held outside the pri\u00ad vate equity fund are measured using the income approach. This involves discounting cash flows on the basis of current business cases using the weighted average cost of capital to determine the fair value of the financial instrument. Changes in fair values determined in connection with adjustments to significant input factors are not material for the BMW Group.\n\nThe convertible bonds that have been classified to Level 3 are  primarily  used  as  instruments  in  advance  of  future financing rounds relating to private equity investments. Val\u00ad uations are therefore performed in accordance with the IPEV guidelines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMandatory conversions are usually structured in such a way that the number of shares to be received depends on the future share price. Due to the generally short maturities, the instruments are subject to only insignificant fluctuations in value.  Irrespective  of  this  fact,  impairment  tests  are  per\u00ad formed at regular intervals.\n\nThe exercise price for share options in such companies is generally low, verging towards zero. Consequently, financing rounds have a direct impact on the fair value of the options. In this respect, the valuation of options and assessment of their impact on sensitivity is similar to the approach taken to unquoted equity instruments, as described above.\n\nFor selected derivatives, a complete set of data relevant for valuation purposes is not available due to their limited mar\u00ad ket maturity. In order to model forward curves, data are col\u00ad lated and updated on the basis of regular bank and trader inquiries. The valuation methodology applied is in line with the general valuation principles for derivatives used within the  treasury  management  system  of  the  BMW Group. Changes in fair values resulting from shifts in forward curves within  a  range  of  + / \u00ad 10 %  are  not  material  for  the BMW Group.",

        "page_content": "## Group  Financial Statements\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to counterparty credit risks if contractual partners, for example a retail customer or a deal\u00ad ership, are unable or only partially able to meet their contrac\u00ad tual obligations. Information on the management of credit risk for receivables from financial services is provided in the Combined Management Report (see section Outlook, Risk and Opportunity Management).\n\nNotwithstanding  the  existence  of  collateral  accepted,  the carrying amount of financial assets (with the exception of derivative  financial  instruments)  generally  represents  the maximum credit risk. In addition, the credit risk is increased by additional unutilised loan commitments in the dealership financing line of business. Total dealership financing credit risk at the end of the reporting period therefore amounted to \u20ac 31,508 million (2020: \u20ac 30,682 million).\n\nIn  the  case  of  all  relationships  underlying  non\u00adderivative financial instruments, in order to minimise the credit risk and depending on the nature and amount of exposure, collateral is required, credit information and references obtained or historical data based on the existing business relationship, in particular payment behaviour, reviewed.\n\nIn  the  case  of  trade  receivables,  customers  are  regularly assessed with regard to their credit risk. Depending on con\u00ad tractual status, necessary measures, such as dunning pro\u00ad cedures, are initiated in good time.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\nThe credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative finan\u00ad cial instruments is minimised by the fact that the Group only enters into such contracts with parties of first\u00adclass credit standing.\n\nWithin the financial services business, items financed for retail customers and dealerships (such as vehicles, facilities and property) serve as first\u00adranking collateral with a recover\u00ad able value. Security is also put up by customers in the form of collateral asset pledges, asset assignment and first\u00adrank\u00ad ing mortgages, supplemented where appropriate by warran\u00ad ties and guarantees. Items previously held as collateral that are subsequently acquired relate mainly to vehicles. As a rule, these assets can be converted into cash at short notice through the dealership organisation. Creditworthiness test\u00ad ing is an important aspect of the BMW Group's credit risk management. Every borrower's creditworthiness is tested for all credit financing and lease contracts entered into by the BMW Group. In the case of retail customer financing, credit\u00ad worthiness  is  assessed  using  validated  scoring  systems integrated in the purchasing process. In the area of dealer\u00ad ship financing, creditworthiness is assessed by means of ongoing credit monitoring and an internal rating system that takes account not only of the material credit standing of the borrower, but also of qualitative factors, such as past reliabil\u00ad ity in business relations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe credit risk on trade receivables is assessed mainly on the basis of information relating to overdue amounts. The gross carrying amounts of these receivables are allocated in accordance with IFRS 9 to overdue ranges used for manage\u00ad ment purposes as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 31. 12. 2021   | 31. 12. 2020              |\n|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| 2,113          | 2,002          | Not overdue               |\n| 120            | 229            | 1 - 30 days overdue       |\n| 12             | 31             | 31 - 60 days overdue      |\n| 14             | 23             | 61 - 90 days overdue      |\n| 34             | 60             | More than 90 days overdue |\n| 2,293          | 2,345          | Total                     |",

However, in view of the processes that have been established for credit risk management, inef\u00ad fectiveness is not expected to arise.\n\nThe BMW Group measures currency risk using a cash\u00adflow\u00ad at\u00adrisk model. The analysis of currency risk is based on fore\u00ad cast  foreign  currency  transactions  which  could  result  in exposures to surpluses of foreign currency cash inflows and cash outflows. At the end of the reporting period, the overall currency exposure - in each case for the following year and determined  by  aggregating  the  individual  currency  expo\u00ad sures based on their absolute amount - was as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 31. 12. 2021   | 31. 12. 2020      |\n|----------------|----------------|-------------------|\n|                | 38,134 33,975  | Currency exposure |\n\nCurrency  exposures  include  short  positions  amounting  to \u20ac  2,715 million (2020: \u20ac  5,222 million).

        "page_content": "## Group  Financial Statements\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest  rate  risks  arise  when  funds  are  borrowed  and invested with differing fixed\u00adrate periods or differing terms. At the BMW Group, all items subject to, or bearing, interest are exposed to interest rate risk and can therefore affect both the assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's interest rate portfolios was as follows at the end of the reporting period:\n\n| in \u20ac million                            | 31. 12. 2021   | 31. 12. 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Fair values of interest rate portfolios | 63,835         | 58,545         |\n\nInterest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives. As part of the implementation of the risk man\u00ad agement  strategy,  interest  rate  risks  are  monitored  and managed  at  regular  intervals.  The  interest  rate  contracts used for hedging purposes comprise mainly swaps, which, if hedge accounting is applied, are accounted for as fair value hedges.  The  economic  relationship  between  the  hedged item and the hedging instrument is based on the fact that the main parameters of the hedged item and the related hedging instrument, for example start date, term and cur\u00ad rency, are the same. Items are hedged on the basis of a con\u00ad stant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nIn view of the fact that own credit risk is excluded from the hedging relationship, ineffectiveness is expected to be low.\n\nFor selected fixed\u00adinterest assets, part of the interest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial  Statements\n\nIn this case, swaps are used as the hedging instrument. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\n\nIn light of the reform and replacement of certain benchmark interest rates, some of the BMW Group's hedging relation\u00ad ships have been redesignated to take account of alternative benchmark interest rates.\n\nThe transition to the newly created or revised benchmark interest rates is being managed, monitored and assessed with regard to risk management implications as part of a multidisciplinary project. The tasks of the conversion project includes  the  continual  monitoring  of  regulatory  develop\u00ad ments, the initiation of necessary changes to systems, pro\u00ad cesses, risk and measurement models as well as the clarifi\u00ad cation of the associated accounting and financial reporting implications.  The  uncertainty  triggered  by  the  benchmark interest rate reform, in the meantime relating primarily to the USD and CAD, is expected to be eliminated during the finan\u00ad cial year 2022.\n\nThe BMW Group's fair value hedges affected by the reform are mainly based on the benchmark interest rates relating to the British pound (GBP), the US dollar (USD) and the Japan yen (JPY). Fair value hedges for which GBP LIBOR and JPY LIBOR were previously designated as the hedged risk were converted during the financial year 2021, with GBP LIBOR replaced  by  the  SONIA  benchmark  interest  rate  and  JPY LIBOR replaced by the TONA benchmark interest rate. The BMW Group  continues  to  see  the  economic  link  and  has therefore continued to account the pertinent items as fair value hedges. The notional amount of financial derivatives\n\nthat have been transferred with effect from 31 December 2021 to an alternative benchmark interest rate in accordance with  the  IBOR  Fallbacks  Protocol  totals  \u20ac  6,890 million (mainly  GBP  LIBOR  \u20ac  4,229 million  and  JPY  LIBOR \u20ac 2,279 million).\n\nIn  the  case  of  USD  LIBOR  and  CAD  CDOR,  uncertainty remains as to the exact timing and nature of the changes. The notional amount of financial derivatives not yet con\u00ad verted to an alternative interest rate at 31 December 2021 is \u20ac 12,522 million (USD LIBOR \u20ac 12,522 million). The nominal amount  of  non\u00adderivative  financial  liabilities  not  yet  con\u00ad verted to an alternative interest rate is \u20ac 700 million (thereof USD LIBOR \u20ac 387 million and CAD CDOR \u20ac 313 million).\n\nThe BMW Group applies a value\u00adat\u00adrisk approach through\u00ad out the Group for internal reporting purposes and to manage interest rate risk. This approach is based on a historical sim\u00ad ulation in which the potential future fair value losses of the interest rate portfolios are compared across the Group with expected amounts on the basis of a holding period of 250 days and a confidence level of 99.98 %. The risk mitigating effect of correlations between the various portfolios is taken into account when the risks are aggregated.\n\nIn the following table the potential volumes of fair value fluc\u00ad tuations  -  measured  on  the  basis  of  the  value\u00adat\u00adrisk approach - are compared with the expected value for the interest\u00adrate\u00adsensitive exposures of the BMW Group:\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 31. 12. 2021   | 31. 12. 2020   |\n|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 1,237          | 1,160          | Value at risk  |\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to hedge these risks, the Group mainly uses forward commodity contracts. As part of the implemen\u00ad tation of the risk management strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided at regular inter\u00ad vals and the corresponding hedging ratio defined. Items are hedged  on  the  basis  of  a  constant  ratio  of  one  to  one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for counterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that have been established for credit risk management, inef\u00ad fectiveness is not expected to arise.\n\nThe economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on the fact that they have the same basis and term. The BMW Group desig\u00ad nates only the commodity price index\u00adlinked raw material surcharge, which is specified in the purchase contracts of vehicle components, as a hedged item. The proportion of the hedged  risk  component  as  a  percentage  of  the  total  fair value depends on the specific types of vehicle component involved. Other price components contained in the contract are not designated as being part of the hedge relationship as no effective hedging instruments exist for these compo\u00ad nents.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial  Statements\n\nThe starting point for analysing raw materials price risk is to identify planned purchases of raw materials or components containing raw materials, the so\u00adcalled 'exposure'.

        "page_content": "## 41 Share\u00adbased  remuneration\n\nThe BMW Group provides three share\u00adbased programmes: one for eligible employees, one for senior heads of depart\u00ad ment and one for members of the Board of Management.\n\n## Employee Share Programme\n\nIn connection with the Employee Share Programme Share Programme, non\u00advoting shares of preferred stock in BMW AG were granted in 2021 to qualifying employees at favourable conditions (see \u2197 note 31 Equity for the number and price of issued shares). Participants in the programme were entitled in 2021 to acquire packages of 10, 20, 30, 40 or 90 shares of preferred stock (2020: 8, 18 or 28) with a discount in each case of \u20ac 13.50 (2020: \u20ac 11.50) per share compared to the market price (average closing price in Xetra trading in the period from 28 October to 3 November 2021: \u20ac 74.28). The programme was open to employees who have been in an employment relationship with BMW AG or a wholly\u00adowned BMW AG subsidiary in Germany, provided that the manage\u00ad ment of the subsidiary concerned has decided to participate in the programme. At the date of the announcement of the programme, there was a requirement for the employment relationship to have existed without interruption for at least one year and for it to continue until the transfer of the shares of preferred stock. Shares of preferred stock acquired in con\u00ad junction with the Employee Share Programme are subject to a vesting period of four years, starting from 1 January of the year in which the shares were acquired.\n\nIn the financial year under report, 1,718,070 (2020: 822,124) shares of preferred stock were acquired by employees. This figure  includes  1,715,000  (2020:  822,000)  shares  out  of Authorised Capital 2019, with the remainder bought back via the stock exchange. Every year the Board of Management of BMW AG decides whether the scheme is to be continued.\n\nNotes to the Group\n\nFinancial  Statements\n\nIn the financial year 2021, the BMW Group recorded a per\u00ad sonnel expense of \u20ac 23 million (2020: \u20ac  9 million) for the Employee Share Programme, corresponding to the differ\u00ad ence between the market price and the reduced price of the shares of preferred stock purchased by employees.\n\n## Programme for senior heads of department and members of the Board of Management\n\nThe share\u00adbased remuneration programme in place in 2021 for qualifying departmental heads is aimed at rewarding a long\u00adterm, entrepreneurial approach to running the business on a sustainable basis. Under the terms of the programme, participants give a commitment to invest an amount equiva\u00ad lent to 26 % of their performance\u00adbased bonus in BMW com\u00ad mon stock and to hold the shares so acquired for a minimum of  four  years.  In  return  for  the  investment  requirement, BMW AG pays 100 % of the investment amount as a net subsidy. Once the four\u00adyear holding period requirement has been fulfilled, the participants receive - for each three com\u00ad mon stock shares held and at the Company's option - one additional share of common stock or the cash equivalent, to be decided at BMW AG's discretion.\n\nWith effect from the financial year 2021, the members of the Board of Management receive an earmarked cash amount (personal investment cash amount), net of taxes and deduc\u00ad tions to be invested in BMW AG common stock. The personal investment cash amount is paid after the end of the Annual General Meeting, at which the separate financial statements of BMW AG for the relevant financial year are presented. The shares of common stock are purchased immediately after the personal investment cash amount has been paid out, and, with effect from the date of purchase, are subject to a holding period of four years. The target amount for the per\u00ad sonal investment cash amount comprises a RoCE compo\u00ad nent (50 %) and a strategic focus targets component (50 %). The RoCE component is determined on the basis of a RoCE factor that depends on the RoCE achieved in the Automotive segment in the grant year. The strategic focus targets com\u00ad\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nponent is determined on the basis of at least two strategic focus targets that are required to be defined before the start of the financial year. Minimum, target and maximum values are defined and factors stipulated for the Automotive seg\u00ad ment's RoCE as well as for each strategic focus target. After the end of the financial year, the relevant factors are deter\u00ad mined on the basis of target achievement.\n\nUp to and including 2020, the members of the Board of Management received an earmarked cash amount (invest\u00ad ment component) amounting to 45 % of the gross amount of the bonus, which, net of taxes and deductions, was required to be invested in BMW common stock, also subject to a four\u00ad year holding period, after which the member of the Board of Management received, at BMW AG's discretion, one addi\u00ad tional share of common stock for every three shares held or, alternatively, the equivalent value in cash (matching compo\u00ad nent).\n\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for early payment of share\u00adbased remuneration components based on the target amounts. Insofar the service contract is prema\u00ad turely  terminated  and  the  Company  has  an  extraordinary right of termination, or if the Board member resigns without the Company's agreement, entitlements to amounts as yet unpaid relating to share\u00adbased remuneration are forfeited.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management in office at the end  of  the  reporting  period  hold  58,560  shares  of  BMW common stock based on holding requirements arising from share\u00adbased remuneration for the financial years 2017 to 2020 (2020: 44,037).",

Further information is provided in \u2197 note 3 Increased shareholding in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\n\nThe  war  in  Ukraine  had  no  impact  on  the  Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. Any potential effects on the BMW Group's business perfor\u00ad mance are being monitored on an ongoing basis. Due to the current situation, local production in Russia as well as the export of automobiles and motorcycles to the Russian mar\u00ad ket have been discontinued for the foreseeable future. The war in Ukraine is having a substantial negative effect on the country's automotive suppliers. The resulting supply restric\u00ad tions  have  led  to  production  schedule  adjustments  and interruptions at a number of BMW Group plants, which in turn is likely to have a negative impact on automobile sales figures. For this reason, the corresponding key performance indicators  reported  by  the  Automotive  segment  are  now forecast to be down on the previous year. The war in Ukraine is not currently expected to have a significant impact on the business performance of the Motorcycles and Financial Ser\u00ad vices segments.\n\nCurrent estimates and assumptions for the financial year 2022, to the extent already known, have been taken into account and described in the outlook. However, the outlook does  not  factor  in  a  significant  tightening  of  sanctions against Russia and/or an escalation of the conflict outside Ukraine. Similarly, additional major price hikes for energy and raw materials, including rises triggered by the war in Ukraine and/or the related sanctions, have not been taken into account.\n\nApart from this, no other events have occurred since the end of the financial year which could have a major impact on the results of operations, financial position and net assets of BMW AG and the BMW Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  segment  also  includes  the operating  companies  BMW  (UK)  Investments  Ltd.  and Bavaria Lloyd Reiseb\u00fcro GmbH, which are not allocated to one of the other segments.\n\n## Internal management and reporting\n\nSegment information is prepared as a general rule in con\u00ad formity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the Group Financial Statements. Exceptions to this general principle include the treatment of inter\u00adseg\u00ad ment warranties, the earnings impact of which is allocated to the  Automotive  and  Financial  Services  segments  on  the basis used internally to manage the business. In addition, intragroup repurchase agreements between the Automotive and  Financial  Services  segments  pursuant  to  IFRS  15, impairment  allowances  on  intragroup  receivables  and changes in the value of consolidated other investments pur\u00ad suant  to  IFRS  9  are  also  excluded.  Intragroup  leasing arrangements are not reflected in the internal management and reporting system on an IFRS 16 basis and therefore, in\n\naccordance with IFRS 8, do not give rise to any changes in the  presentation  of  segment  information.  Inter\u00adsegment receivables and payables, provisions, income, expenses and profits  are  eliminated  upon  consolidation.  Inter\u00adsegment revenues are based on market prices. Centralised cost com\u00ad ponents are included in the respective segments, without resulting in cash settlement.\n\nThe role of 'chief operating decision maker' with respect to resource  allocation  and  performance  assessment  of  the reportable segment is embodied in the full Board of Man\u00ad agement. For this purpose, different measures of segment performance  as  well  as  segment  assets  are  taken  into account in the operating segments.\n\nThe Automotive and Motorcycles segments are managed on the basis of return on capital employed (RoCE). The relevant measure  of  segment  results  used  is  therefore  profit  before financial result. Capital employed is the corresponding meas\u00ad ure  of  segment  assets  used  to  determine  how  to  allocate resources and comprises all current and non\u00adcurrent opera\u00ad tional assets after deduction of liabilities used operationally which are generally not subject to interest (e. g. trade payables).\n\nWith effect from the reporting year 2022, a simplified defini\u00ad tion of capital employed will be applied to make the RoCE calculation more comprehensible and transparent for users. Further  information  is  provided  in  the  section  'Managing operational performance at segment level' within the Com\u00ad bined Management Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Transparent reporting and corporate communi\u00ad cation, corporate governance that is aligned with the inter\u00ad ests of all stakeholders, cooperation based on trust be\u00ad tween the Board of Management, Supervisory Board and employees, and compliance with applicable law are essen\u00ad tial cornerstones  of  the  corporate  culture  within  the BMW Group.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board re\u00ad port below on the main features of corporate governance. A detailed report on corporate governance can be found in the  Statement  on  Corporate  Governance,  available  at \u2197 www.bmwgroup.com / statement on corporate governance (Corporate Governance).\n\n## INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S GOVERNING CONSTITUTION\n\nThe designation BMW Group comprises Bayerische Motor\u00ad en Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG) and its Group en\u00ad tities.

The  Supervisory  Board  appoints  the members of the Board of Management and can, at any time, revoke an appointment for good cause. The Board of Man\u00ad agement informs the Supervisory Board and reports to it regularly,  promptly  and  comprehensively,  in  line  with  the principles of conscientious and faithful accountability and in accordance with the law and the reporting duties determined by the Supervisory Board. The Board of Management re\u00ad quires  the  approval  of  the  Supervisory  Board  for  certain\n\nmajor proceedings. The Supervisory Board is not, however, authorised to undertake management measures itself.\n\nThe close interaction between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in the interests of the enterprise as  described  above  is  also  known  as  a  'two\u00adtier  board structure'.\n\n## BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Board of Management manages the enterprise under its own responsibility, acting in the best interests of the enter\u00ad prise with the aim of achieving sustainable creation of value. The interests of shareholders, employees and other stake\u00ad holders are also taken into account in the pursuit of this aim. \u2197 GRI 102\u00ad43\n\nIn accordance with \u00a7 7 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Management of BMW AG comprises two or more persons; other than that, the number of members of the Board  of  Management  is  determined  by  the  Supervisory Board.  At  31  December  2021,  the  Board  of  Management comprised seven members. The Board of Management de\u00ad cides on the principal guidelines for managing the enter\u00ad prise, determines and agrees upon the strategic orientation with the Supervisory Board, and ensures its implementation.

The ten Supervisory Board  members  representing  employees  comprise  seven Company employees, including one executive staff repre\u00ad sentative, and three members elected following nomination by unions. The Supervisory Board is charged with the task of advising and supervising the Board of Management in its management of BMW AG.

The Supervisory Board reports on the handling of such conflicts of interest to the Annual Gen\u00ad eral Meeting. Conflicts of interest requiring to be disclosed include, in particular, conflicts of interest that may result from a directorship function or advisory role with clients, suppli\u00ad ers,  lenders  or  other  business  partners.  If  a  Supervisory Board member has significant and non\u00adtemporary conflicts of interest, this will lead to the termination of the mandate.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly assesses the effectiveness of its activities and the activities carried out by its commit\u00ad tees by means of a questionnaire as well as discussions with\n\nthe Chairman. The findings and conclusions resulting from this self\u00adassessment process are subsequently discussed in plenary.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has stated specific targets for its composition, agreed to a diversity concept and determined a competency profile. Members of the Supervisory Board are responsible for undertaking any training required for the per\u00ad formance  of  their  duties,  appropriately  assisted  by  the Company.\n\nTaking  into  account  the  specific  circumstances  of  the BMW Group and the number of Board members, the Super\u00ad visory Board has set up a Presiding Board and four commit\u00ad tees, namely the Personnel Committee, the Audit Commit\u00ad tee, the Nomination Committee  and  the  Mediation Committee. These serve to raise the effectiveness of the Su\u00ad pervisory Board's work and facilitate the handling of com\u00ad plex issues.\n\nThe composition of the Presiding Board and the committees is based on legal requirements, the Articles of Incorporation, the rules of procedure and corporate governance principles, particularly taking into account the professional expertise of their members.\n\nBMW AG ensures that the Supervisory Board and its com\u00ad mittees are appropriately equipped to carry out their duties. This includes providing a central Supervisory Board office to support the chairpersons in their coordination work.\n\nMore information about the composition of the Supervisory Board, and how it operates and its individual committees, is provided  in  the  Statement  on  Corporate  Governance  at \u2197 www.bmwgroup.com / statement on corporate governance .\n\n\u2197 GRI\u00adIndex: 102\u00ad23\n\n<!-- image -->",

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial state\u00ad ments as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n## 1 Measurement of leased products\n\n- 2 Valuation of receivables from sales financing\n- 3 Valuation of provisions for statutory and non\u00adstatutory warranty obligations and product guarantees\n- 4     Presentation of the acquisition of BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, China, after the balance sheet date in the notes\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been struc\u00ad tured in each case as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Matter and issue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\nAudit approach and findings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3 Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n## 1 Measurement of leased products\n\n- 1 The BMW Group leases vehicles to end customers under operating leases (leased products). At the balance sheet date, the figure reported under the 'leased products' line item for operating leases was EUR 44,700 million (ap\u00ad proximately 19.5 % of total assets). Leased products are measured at cost, which is depreciated on a straight\u00adline basis over the lease term to the expected residual value (recoverable amount). A key estimated value for subse\u00ad quent measurement of leased products is the expected residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  The BMW Group uses internally available data on historical empirical values, current market data and market esti\u00ad mates as well as forecasts by external market research institutes.  The  estimation  of  future  residual  values  is subject to judgment due to the large number of assump\u00ad tions  to  be  made  by  the  executive  directors  and  the amount of data included in the determination.\n\nAgainst this background and due to the resulting signifi\u00ad cant uncertainties with regard to estimates in the context of measuring the residual values of the leased products, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n- 2 As part of our audit we obtained an understanding of the development of operating leases, the underlying residu\u00ad al value risks as well as the business processes for the identification, management, monitoring and measure\u00ad ment of residual value risks, among other things by in\u00ad quiries and inspection of documents related to the inter\u00ad nal calculation methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system, particularly regarding the determination of ex\u00ad pected residual values. This included the evaluation of the propriety of the relevant IT systems as well as the implemented interfaces therein by our IT\u00adspecialists. In addition, we evaluated the appropriateness of the fore\u00ad casting methods, the model assumptions as well as the parameters used for the measurement of the residual values  based  on  the  validations  carried  out  by  the BMW Group.  For  this  purpose,  we  inquired  with  the BMW Group's experts responsible for the management and monitoring of residual value risks and inspected the internal analysis on residual value developments and re\u00ad sidual value forecasts as well as the validation results. We  examined  the  mathematically  correctness  of  the forecast values using the key calculation steps.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the methods and processes for determin\u00ad ing the expected residual values of leased products un\u00ad derlying the valuation are appropriate and the assump\u00ad tions and parameters included in the forecast model for the residual value are appropriate as a whole.\n\n- 3     The Company's disclosures on the applied 'Accounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations' are contained  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements under note 6 and on leased products are contained under note 23.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2     Valuation of receivables from sales financing\n\n- 1 The BMW Group offers end customers, dealerships and importers various financing models for vehicles. In this context, current and non\u00adcurrent receivables from sales financing totaling EUR 87,417 million are reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as at the balance sheet date (approximately 38.1 % of total as\u00ad sets). Impairment losses amounting to EUR 1,599 mil\u00ad lion were recognized on these receivables as at the bal\u00ad ance sheet date. In order to determine the amount of the necessary valuation allowances to be recognized with respect  to  receivables  from  sales  financing,  the BMW Group, among others, evaluates the creditworthi\u00ad ness of the dealers, importers and end customers, as well as any loss ratios, and risk provisioning parameters are derived based on historical default probabilities and loss ratios.\n\nThe determination of the valuation allowances by the executive directors is subject to a significant degree of judgment due to several value\u00adinfluencing factors such as the estimation of creditworthiness, the determina\u00ad tion of probabilities of default and loss ratios and was therefore of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n- 2     As part of our audit we obtained a comprehensive un\u00ad derstanding  of  the  development  of  receivables  from sales financing, the associated default\u00adrelated risks as well as the business processes for the identification, management, monitoring and measurement of default risks, among other things by inquiries and inspection of documents on the internal calculation methods. Fur\u00ad thermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effec\u00ad tiveness of the internal control system regarding the determination of the impairment loss to recognize. In this context, we also evaluated the relevant IT systems and internal processes. The evaluation included an as\u00ad\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\nsessment by our IT\u00adspecialists of the appropriateness of the systems concerned and associated interfaces to ensure the completeness of data as well as the audit of automated controls for data processing. As part of our audit we assessed in particular the appropriateness of the risk classification procedures as well as the risk provisioning  parameters  used.  For  this  purpose,  we analyzed  in  particular  the  validations  of  parameters that are regularly conducted by the Company. To as\u00ad sess the default risk, we also used targeted sampling of individual cases to examine whether the attributes for assignment to the respective risk categories were suit\u00ad ably available and the impairment losses had been cal\u00ad culated using the parameters defined for these risk cat\u00ad egories.\n\nIn our view, the assumptions and parameters used in the measurement of receivables from sales financing were appropriate overall.\n\n- 3     The Company's disclosures on the applied 'Accounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations' are contained  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements under note 6 and on 'receivables from sales financing' are contained under note 25.\n\n## 3     Valuation of provisions for statutory and non\u00adstatu\u00ad tory warranty obligations and product guarantees\n\n- 1 Provisions for statutory and non\u00adstatutory warranty ob\u00ad ligations as well as product guarantees are included in the consolidated financial statements of BMW Group as a material amount in other provisions. The obligations amounted to EUR 6,600 million (approximately 2.9 % of total assets) as at December 31, 2021. BMW Group is re\u00ad sponsible for the legally required warranty and product guarantees in the respective sales market. In order to estimate  the  liabilities  arising  from  statutory  and non\u00adstatutory warranty obligations and product guar\u00ad\n\nantees for vehicles sold, information on the type and volume of damages arising and on remedial measures is recorded and analyzed at vehicle model level. The ex\u00ad pected amount of obligations is extrapolated from costs of the past and recognized as a provision in the corre\u00ad sponding amount, if the criteria of IAS 37 have been met. For specific or anticipated individual circumstanc\u00ad es, for example recalls, additional provisions are recog\u00ad nized provided they have not already been taken into account.\n\nThe determination of provisions is associated with una\u00ad voidable estimation uncertainties and is subject to a high risk of change, depending on factors such as notification of detected defects as well as claims made by vehicle owners. Against this background, this matter was of par\u00ad ticular significance during our audit.\n\n- 2     In order to assess the appropriateness of the valuation method used for the determination of the provisions for statutory and non\u00adstatutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees including the assumptions and parameters, we primarily obtained an understanding of the process for determining the assumptions and pa\u00ad rameters through discussions with the responsible em\u00ad ployees of the BMW Group. We also evaluated the ap\u00ad propriateness as well as effectiveness of controls for determining the assumptions and parameters. With the involvement of our IT specialists, we checked the IT sys\u00ad tems used regarding their compliance. We compared the expenses for claims and technical actions with actual costs incurred in order to draw conclusions on the fore\u00ad cast accuracy. Based on a targeted sample of vehicle models, the mathematically correctness of the valuation model used across the Group was examined. We exam\u00ad ined  and  evaluated  the  assumptions  used  by  the BMW Group concerning the extent to which the past val\u00ad ues were representative of the expected susceptibility of damage,  the  expected  value  of  damage  per  vehicle\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taking into consideration the information available, we believe that, overall, the measurement parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are appropriate.\n\n- 3     The Company's disclosures on the applied 'Accounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations' are contained  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements under note 6 and on 'Other provisions' are contained under note 33.\n\n## 4     Presentation of the acquisition of BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, China, after the balance sheet date in the notes\n\n- 1 The BMW Group held so far 50 % of shares in BMW Bril\u00ad liance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, China. On October 11, 2018, a purchase agreement was concluded for the ac\u00ad quisition of a further 25 % of the shares in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. Shenyang, China. The acquisition was subject to the removal of the joint venture obligation for automotive production in China, which occurred in Jan\u00ad uary 2022. The closing of the transaction was on Feb\u00ad ruary 11, 2022. The acquisition date therefore falls with\u00ad in the preparation phase of the consolidated financial statements for financial year 2021. The previously held shares will be measured at fair value as at the acquisi\u00ad tion  date,  which  will  result  in  an  appreciation  effect amounting to EUR 7.0 billion to EUR 8.0 billion in the financial year 2022. Due to the gain of control after the balance sheet date but prior to the approval of the pub\u00ad\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\nlication of the consolidated financial statements for financial year 2021 , disclosures in the notes to the financial statements are already required for the busi\u00ad ness combination (a as is the case for acquisitions during the reporting period) in accordance with IFRS 3 and IAS 10.\n\nDue to the estimates made by the executive directors in determining  the  appreciation  effect  on  the  previously held shares and the associated uncertainties as well as the significance of this matter for an assessment of the future net assets and liabilities, financial position and fi\u00ad nancial performance of the Group, this matter was of par\u00ad ticular significance during our audit.\n\n- 2 As part of our audit of the presentation of the acquisition of BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. Shenyang, China, we first inspected the contractual agreements and, based on this, evaluated the acquisition date, with the involve\u00ad ment of our specialists in international accounting. Fur\u00ad thermore, we examined the determination of the appre\u00ad ciation  effect.  In  view  of  the  special  features  of determining the fair values in the context of the prelimi\u00ad nary purchase price allocation, our valuation specialists assisted us in the process. Together, we examined the appreciation effect and, by using checklists, evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements required under IFRS 3 and IAS 10.\n\nOverall, we were able to satisfy ourselves that, taking into consideration the information available, the acquisition is properly presented in the notes to the consolidated fi\u00ad nancial statements and that the estimates and assump\u00ad tions made by the executive directors are appropriate overall for the presentation of the acquisition.\n\n- 3     The Company's disclosures relating to the acquisition are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 3 'Increase of share in BMW Bril\u00ad liance Automotive Ltd.'.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other infor\u00ad mation.  The  other  information  comprises  the  following non\u00adaudited parts of the group management report:\n\n- - the 'Corporate Governance' section of the group man\u00ad agement report\n- - the disclosures marked with ' \u2026 ' of the non\u00adfinancial statement pursuant to \u00a7 289b Abs. 1 HGB and \u00a7 315b Abs. 1 HGB\n\nThe other information comprises further\n\n- - the  statement  on  corporate  governance  pursuant  to \u00a7 289f HGB and \u00a7 315d HGB\n- - the remuneration report pursuant to \u00a7 162 AktG [Aktien\u00ad gesetz: German Stock Corporation Act], for which the supervisory board is also responsible\n- - all  remaining  parts  of  the  annual  report  -  excluding cross\u00adreferences to external information - with the excep\u00ad tion of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have  determined  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the exec\u00ad utive  directors  are  responsible  for  assessing  the  Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation  of  the  group  management  report  that,  as  a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\nand is, in all material respects, consistent with the consoli\u00ad dated financial statements, complies with German legal re\u00ad quirements,  and  appropriately  presents  the  opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and meas\u00ad ures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in ac\u00ad cordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe  supervisory  board  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group manage\u00ad ment report.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consoli\u00ad dated Financial Statements and of the Group Manage\u00ad ment Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated fi\u00ad nancial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropri\u00ad ately presents the opportunities and risks of future develop\u00ad ment, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with  German  Generally  Accepted  Standards  for  Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaft\u00ad spr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are con\u00ad\n\nsidered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain profession\u00ad al skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropri\u00ad ate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstanc\u00ad es, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of es\u00ad timates made by the executive directors and related dis\u00ad closures.\n- - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive direc\u00ad tors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a materi\u00ad al uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to con\u00ad tinue as a going concern.

As a result of the implementation of the second EU Shareholder Rights Directive via \u00a7 162 AktG, the reporting standard applicable to Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktienge\u00ad sellschaft (BMW AG) has changed as of the reporting year 2021.  The  report  shows  and  explains  the  remuneration granted and owed to the individual current and former mem\u00ad bers  of  the  Board  of  Management  and  the  Supervisory Board of BMW AG in the financial year 2021. 1\n\nIn order to facilitate understanding, the basic features of the remuneration  systems  applicable  to  the  members  of  the Board of Management and the members of the Supervisory Board, as applied in the 2021 financial year, are also set out below. In view of the fact that individual members of the Board of Management also received remuneration components from earlier remuneration systems during the 2021 financial year (specifically the remuneration systems for the 2016 financial year and for 2019 financial year) elements of these systems are also explained to the extent necessary for comprehension.\n\nThe  auditing  firm  PricewaterhouseCoopers  GmbH  has audited the remuneration report beyond the requirements of \u00a7 162 (3) Sentences 1 and 2 AktG.\n\n## I. Review of the past financial year from a remunera\u00ad tion perspective\n\nThe Supervisory Board adopted the current remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management with\n\neffect  from  1  January  2021.  The  Annual  General  Meeting approved it on 12 May 2021 with a majority of 91.60 % of the valid votes cast.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by supply shortages and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, 2021 was a very successful financial year for the BMW Group, with solid sales growth for its BMW, MINI and Rolls\u00adRoyce brands. The BMW brand set a new sales record and took over the top position in the global premium segment. In 2021, the BMW Group also con\u00ad sistently pushed ahead with the expansion of its range of electrified models, increasing the share of electrified vehicles sold by the BMW and MINI brands by more than 70 per cent compared to 2020. The launch of the BMW iX and the BMW i4 also marked the entry of two products at the forefront of innovation to the market.\n\nUnder  the  leadership  of  the  Board  of  Management,  the BMW Group's management continued to steer the company in a prudent fashion through the volatile and challenging environment that characterised last year. For example, the production,  sales  and  purchasing  networks  successfully managed the challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic and supply bottlenecks, demonstrating genuine flexibility in the process. As a result, the impact of Covid\u00ad19 was limited over the past financial year.",

        "page_content": "At  the  same  time,  the  Board  of  Management  of  the BMW Group worked very constructively and intensively on the core strategic course for the future, in order to create the conditions for an attractive and future\u00adoriented product port\u00ad folio, and to achieve a significant improvement in profitabil\u00ad ity. The strategic decisions taken in this regard focused in particular on strategic issues related to electrification.\n\nIn December 2020, the Supervisory Board set ambitious tar\u00ad gets linked to the variable remuneration of the members of the Board of Management for the 2021 financial year. Of the total variable target remuneration available, approximately 38 % is linked to environmental, social or governance (ESG) targets. It set targets for fleet carbon emissions in the EU and sales targets for electrified vehicles in the 2021 financial year as strategic focus targets for long\u00adterm variable remu\u00ad neration (share\u00adbased remuneration). In doing so, it attached particular significance to the strategic importance of acceler\u00ad ating market penetration for electrified vehicles and sustain\u00ad ability targets in determining remuneration.\n\nThanks to its strong overall performance, the Board of Man\u00ad agement exceeded both the financial and non\u00adfinancial tar\u00ad gets for short\u00adterm variable remuneration (bonuses) \u2197 'Bonus for the 2021 financial year' . The financial target regarding long\u00ad term  variable  remuneration  (share\u00adbased  remuneration) was  also  exceeded  with  regard  to  the  return  on  capital employed (RoCE) in the Automotive segment. The Board of Management achieved (or nearly achieved) the ambitious non\u00adfinancial strategic focus targets for long\u00adterm variable remuneration. At 115.9 g / km, fleet carbon emissions came in under the EU legal limit of 125.8 g / km \u2197 'Share\u00adbased remuner\u00ad ation for the 2021 financial year' .\n\nIf necessary, and in the interest of the long\u00adterm success of BMW AG, the Supervisory Board may temporarily deviate from the remuneration system - as provided for in \u00a7 87a (2) Sentence 2 AktG. In accordance with G.11 of the German Cor\u00ad porate  Governance  Code  dated  16  December  2019,  the Supervisory  Board  has  also  reserved  the  right  to  make adjustments if extraordinary developments occur, such as significant acquisitions  and  disposals,  or  changes  in accounting standards or tax regulations that have a signifi\u00ad cant impact. After due examination, the Supervisory Board did not make use of these options for the 2021 financial year.\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Board  of  Management  did  not change during the year. For Dr. Wendt, the target remunera\u00ad tion applicable to Members of the Board of Management from the second mandate period onwards was applied at the beginning of his second mandate period, from 1 October 2021 onwards.\n\nThe remuneration system for the members of the Supervi\u00ad sory Board is set out in Article 15 of the Articles of Incorpora\u00ad tion. It was confirmed by the Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2021 with a majority of 99.40 % of the valid votes cast, and implemented for the 2021 financial year in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation.\n\nIn the 2021 financial year, there were several changes to the composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  meaning  that  the Supervisory Board remuneration for individual Supervisory Board members had to be calculated pro rata temporis. With effect from the end of the 2021 Annual General Meeting, Dr. Kley resigned from the Supervisory Board and the Personnel Committee, which, among other things, is responsible for preparing decisions in connection with Board of Manage\u00ad ment remuneration. The Supervisory Board elected Dr. Bock as his successor on the Personnel Committee, with effect from 12 May 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- II. Remuneration of the members of the Board of Management\n- 1. Principles of the remuneration system and the contribution of remuneration to the promotion of the company's business strategy and its long\u00adterm development\n\nThe remuneration system in place since the 2021 financial year is easy to understand and clearly structured. It complies with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations and suggestions of the German  Corporate  Governance  Code.  The  Supervisory Board has applied the following principles in designing the remuneration system for the Board of Management:\n\n- - The remuneration structure is geared towards the sus\u00ad tainable  and  long\u00adterm  development  of  the  company. Therefore, variable remuneration components are pre\u00ad dominantly granted on the basis of a multi\u00adyear assess\u00ad ment.\n- - The total remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is commensurate with their tasks and per\u00ad formance as well as the company's situation.\n- - The remuneration system ensures that both positive and negative developments are appropriately reflected in the remuneration ('pay for performance').\n- - The remuneration system takes into account both the performance of the entire Board of Management and the achievement of individual targets.\n- - The remuneration system observes the principle of con\u00ad sistency between the remuneration systems in the com\u00ad pany: The remuneration systems for the Board of Man\u00ad agement, executives and employees of BMW AG are all designed in a similar way.",

        "page_content": "- - The  total  remuneration  is  in  line  with  market  practice both in terms of amount and structure, and takes into account the size, complexity and economic situation of the company.\n\nThe BMW Group aims to be the most successful and sus\u00ad tainable premium provider of individual mobility. The busi\u00ad ness strategy focuses on the customer and the provision of sustainable individual mobility in the premium segment, tak\u00ad ing into account high profitability, in order to secure the com\u00ad pany's independence in the future. The remuneration sys\u00ad tem  contributes  to  the  implementation  of  the  business strategy and the sustainable and long\u00adterm development of the company. It also takes into account the concerns of the company's important stakeholders (in particular, sharehold\u00ad ers, customers, and employees). The incentive effects of the various remuneration components have a complementary effect.\n\n- - The fixed basic remuneration counteracts the temptation to take disproportionately high risks in order to achieve short\u00adterm goals, and thus contributes to the long\u00adterm development of the company.\n- - The variable bonus is divided into two parts, which influ\u00ad ence behaviour in different ways. The earnings\u00adrelated component of the bonus rewards recipients for achieving the company's financial targets in the vesting year, and promotes  the  earnings\u00adrelated  parts  of  the  business strategy. In contrast, the performance component of the bonus  is  based  on  non\u00adfinancial  performance  criteria, which are also derived from the business strategy. In this respect, the performance component of the bonus also offers particular incentives to encourage individuals con\u00ad sistently to pursue the goals of the business strategy for the long\u00adterm development of the company. These goals\n\ndo not have to be directly reflected in the key financial indicators for a given vesting year.\n\n- - The amount of the variable share\u00adbased remuneration also depends on the fulfilment of financial and non\u00adfi\u00ad nancial  objectives  derived  from  the  business  strategy, since  50 %  of  the  target  cash  amount  earmarked  for share  purchases  is  linked  to  a  financial  key  indicator (RoCE in the Automotive segment), and 50 % is linked to strategic  focus  targets.  The  obligation  to  use  the  net amount to purchase shares of common stock in the com\u00ad pany and to hold these shares for at least four years also motivates the members of the Board of Management to strive to ensure the long\u00adterm positive development of the company, as this in turn promotes sustainable posi\u00ad tive developments in the price of BMW shares.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Determination and review of the remuneration  system and individual remuneration\n\nDetermining the system and structure of Board of Manage\u00ad ment remuneration, and reviewing it regularly, is a task of the full Supervisory Board, as is determining the individual level of remuneration of members of the Board of Management. The Personnel Committee of the Supervisory Board assumes a preparatory function in the determination and review of the remuneration system as a whole, and of the individual remu\u00ad neration paid to members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  reviews  the  remuneration  system annually to ensure it is appropriate in terms of structure, tar\u00ad get and maximum remuneration, as well as actual remuner\u00ad ation. The Supervisory Board also takes remuneration stud\u00ad ies into account when assessing the market conformity of the  target  and  maximum  remuneration,  as  well  as  when assessing actual remuneration in horizontal terms. Due to the size and structure of the BMW Group, DAX companies are used as a comparison group and the remuneration data from this group is compared with the remuneration paid to members of the Board of Management at BMW AG. Verti\u00ad cally, the Supervisory Board compares the remuneration of members of the Board of Management with the remunera\u00ad tion of senior executives and with the average remuneration of employees employed by BMW AG in Germany in areas inside and outside the scope of collective bargaining agree\u00ad ments, including in terms of how they have changed over a period of several years. Recommendations from independ\u00ad ent external remuneration experts, as well as suggestions from investor and analyst circles, may also be included in the deliberations.  For  the  2021  financial  year,  the  review  has shown that the target and maximum remuneration as well as actual remuneration are appropriate.\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration system, the Supervi\u00ad sory Board - acting on the proposal of the Personnel Com\u00ad mittee - sets specific target remuneration for each individual member  of  the  Board  of  Management  for  the  upcoming financial year, as well as the performance criteria associated with the variable remuneration components provided for in the remuneration system.\n\nThe total target remuneration is composed of the fixed remu\u00ad neration and the variable remuneration. Within the variable remuneration, the proportion of share\u00adbased remuneration as long\u00adterm variable remuneration exceeds the share of the bonus as short\u00adterm variable remuneration. The share of the individual  remuneration  components  is  within  the  ranges specified by the remuneration system.\n\n## a) Target remuneration for the 2021 financial year\n\nThe following tables show the individual target remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the rela\u00ad tive share of the respective remuneration component in the total target remuneration.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF TOTAL TARGET REMUNERATION FOR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nin %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExcluding a possible payment to new members of the Board of Management to compensate for salary losses from a previous employment relationship and/or to cover relocation costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This variable component of the remuneration system applicable for the financial years 2018 to 2020 falls under the overall caps set by the Supervisory Board for the vesting year 2019. A final assessment of compliance with the overall caps set for the 2019 vesting year will only be possible when the matching component of the share\u00adbased remuneration for the 2019 vesting year is paid out after the expiry of the four\u00adyear shareholding period in the 2024 financial year.\n\nThe remuneration granted and owed for the 2021 financial year pursuant to \u00a7 162 AktG \u2197 Remuneration granted and owed also includes  the  payment  of  the  matching  component  of  the share\u00adbased remuneration for the 2016 vesting year to the members of the Board of Management who were in office in that financial year. This payment was made in May 2021, after the expiry of the four\u00adyear shareholding period. This\n\ncomponent is subject to the overall cap set for the vesting year 2016, which was complied with for the members of the Board of Management in office at that time.\n\n## 4. Remuneration for the 2021 financial year\n\nFollowing  a  proposal  by  the  Personnel  Committee,  the Supervisory Board determined in December 2020 the target remuneration for the members of the Board of Management for the 2021 financial year, as well as the performance crite\u00ad ria for the variable remuneration components provided for in the remuneration system. In March 2022, at the suggestion of the Personnel Committee, the Supervisory Board set or confirmed the amount of the variable remuneration compo\u00ad nents due to the members of the Board of Management for the 2021 financial year after reviewing and assessing the extent to which the targets had been achieved.\n\n## a) Fixed remuneration for the 2021 financial year\n\nEach member of the Board of Management receives a fixed basic remuneration, which is paid monthly on a pro rata basis.  The  fixed  basic  remuneration  ensures  a  minimum income appropriate to the tasks and responsibilities of a member of the Board of Management. It counteracts the temptation to take disproportionately high risks in order to achieve short\u00adterm goals, and thus contributes to the com\u00ad pany's long\u00adterm development.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF FIXED REMUNERATION FOR THE 2021 FINANCIAL YEAR (IN \u20ac)\n\n|                   | Base salary   | Fringe benefits (other  remuneration)   | Total fixed remuneration   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Oliver Zipse      | 1,950,000     | 19,355                                  | 1,969,355                  |\n| Ilka Horstmeier   | 900,000       | 47,633                                  | 947,633                    |\n| Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107 | 900,000       | 43,237                                  | 943,237                    |\n| Pieter Nota       | 1,050,000     | 18,525                                  | 1,068,525                  |\n| Nicolas Peter     | 1,050,000     | 22,746                                  | 1,072,746                  |\n| Frank Weber       | 900,000       | 97,833                                  | 997,833                    |\n| Andreas Wendt     | 937,500       | 60,303                                  | 997,803                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe amount of the basic remuneration depends on the indi\u00ad vidual's respective function on the Board of Management and the duration of their tenure on the Board of Manage\u00ad ment or their appointment period, as applicable.\n\nThe fringe benefits include, in particular, insurance benefits, non\u00adcash benefits from vehicle use and use of telephones and computers, health care, employee discounts and subsi\u00ad dies for safety equipment. In addition, the Supervisory Board can approve payments to newly appointed members of the Board of Management in order to compensate them for loss of salary from a previous employment relationship and / or to cover relocation costs. No such approvals were issued in the 2021 financial year.\n\n## b) Variable remuneration for the 2021 financial year\n\nThe variable remuneration for the 2021 financial year con\u00ad sists of the bonus and the share\u00adbased remuneration. The bonus consists of the earnings and performance compo\u00ad nents, and the share\u00adbased remuneration (personal cash investment amount) consists of the RoCE component and the strategic focus targets component. The performance cri\u00ad teria for the variable remuneration paid to members of the Board of Management are based on the Group's key strate\u00ad gic financial and non\u00adfinancial targets and performance indi\u00ad cators, and sustainably promote the Group's development. When  determining  specific  target  values,  the  Supervisory Board takes into account, in particular, long\u00adterm corporate planning and business development planning for the follow\u00ad ing year. These plans are prepared by the Board of Manage\u00ad ment and submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval.

If 100 % of the target is achieved, the share of the bonus attached to each component is 50 % of the individual target amount of the bonus. The bonus amount is  capped  at  180 %  of  the  individual  target  amount.  The bonus is paid following the Annual General Meeting at which the annual financial statements for the vesting year are pre\u00ad sented.\n\n## Earnings component of the bonus\n\nThe earnings component of the bonus rewards the perfor\u00ad mance of the business in the vesting year, as measured by the financial indicators 'Profit attributable to shareholders of BMW AG' and 'Group post\u00adtax return on sales'. For this pur\u00ad pose,  the  Supervisory  Board  adopts  an  allocation  matrix before the start of the vesting year, from which an earnings factor is derived based on the values achieved.\n\nFor both indicators, the Supervisory Board defines a mini\u00ad mum value, a target value and a maximum value before the start of the vesting year.

In the financial year 2021, BMW AG's share of profit attributable to shareholders was \u20ac 12.4 billion, and the Group post\u00adtax return on sales was 11.2 %. Both key indicators exceeded the maximum val\u00ad ues defined for the assessment of the earnings component, so the earnings factor has been capped at the maximum value of 1.800 (corresponding to a target achievement of 180 %, the highest possible percentage).\n\n## Performance component of the bonus\n\nThe  performance  component  of  the  bonus  rewards  the achievement  of  certain  non\u00adfinancial  targets.  Before  the beginning of the financial year, the Supervisory Board sets these  targets  in  the  form  of  various  non\u00adfinancial  perfor\u00ad mance criteria and associated metrics. The performance cri\u00ad teria are derived primarily from the corporate strategy, long\u00ad term  corporate  planning  and  the  business  development planning done for the following year. The targets are divided into individual targets for the individual members of the Board of Management (departmental targets) and collective targets for the entire Board of Management (interdepartmental tar\u00ad gets). The Supervisory Board has discretion in weighting the performance  criteria.  Approximately  10 %  of  the  target amount for the performance bonus is intended to be allo\u00ad\n\n## TARGETS SET AND ACHIEVED EARNINGS COMPONENT OF BONUS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2021\n\n| Performance criteria                                       |   Minimum  value |   Target   value |   Maximum  value |   Actual   value | Target  achievement  in %   | Earnings  factor   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n| Profit attributable to shareholders of BMW AG in \u20ac billion |                3 |              5.3 |               11 |             12.4 | 180 %                       | 1,800              |\n| Group post\u00adtax return on sales in %                         |                3 |              5.6 |                9 |             11.2 | 180 %                       | 1,800              |\n\n## OVERVIEW OF EARNINGS COMPONENT OF THE BONUS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2021\n\n| Member of the Board of Management   | Proportionate target bonus  amount in \u20ac   | Earnings factor   | Earnings component   of bonus in \u20ac   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Oliver Zipse                        | 1,050,000                                 |                   | 1,890,000                            |\n| Ilka Horstmeier                     | 475,000                                   |                   | 855,000                              |\n| Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107                   | 475,000                                   |                   | 855,000                              |\n| Pieter Nota                         | 575,000                                   | 1.800             | 1,035,000                            |\n| Nicolas Peter                       | 575,000                                   |                   | 1,035,000                            |\n| Frank Weber                         | 475,000                                   |                   | 855,000                              |\n| Andreas Wendt                       | 500,000                                   |                   | 900,000                              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncated to the departmental targets. Departmental targets can be department\u00adspecific targets or contributions to shared tar\u00ad gets measured individually for each department. The remain\u00ad der of the target amount for the performance bonus (amount\u00ad ing  to  approximately  90 %)  should  be  associated  with interdepartmental,  non\u00adfinancial  targets.  In  this  regard, around 50 % of the target amount should be connected to the achievement of non\u00adfinancial targets relating to environmen\u00ad tal, social and governance (i. e., ESG targets).\n\n## Targets set and extent of achievement - performance component of the bonus for the financial year 2021\n\nThe targets set by the Supervisory Board for the 2021 vesting year as part of the performance component of the bonus, the weighting of the relevant criteria and the individual target achievement are summarised in the tables below.\n\nIn  order  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  targets  were achieved  in  2021,  the  Supervisory  Board  assessed  the departmental targets, on the one hand, and the interdepart\u00ad mental targets, on the other hand, within a target achieve\u00ad ment corridor with a partial performance factor between 0 (corresponding to a target being 0 % achieved) and 1.80 (corresponding to a target being 180 % achieved, the high\u00ad est  possible  percentage).  The  performance  factor  for  the bonus was determined from the two partial performance factors, with a weighting of 10 % for the departmental tar\u00ad gets and 90 % for the interdepartmental targets. With regard to the interdepartmental targets, 50 % of the weighting is for non\u00adfinancial environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets, and 40 % is for other non\u00adfinancial targets.\n\nIn  order  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  targets  were achieved, the Supervisory Board assessed the leadership performance of the individual members of the Board of Man\u00ad agement and the overall performance of the Board of Man\u00ad agement as a whole. With regard to the departmental tar\u00ad gets, the  Supervisory  Board  assessed  the  individual performance of each member of the Board of Management.",

The Supervisory Board's decision\u00admaking process is based on a detailed, documented analysis of performance as measured against all the agreed criteria, as well as in\u00addepth discus\u00ad sions at Personnel Committee and full Supervisory Board level. As a basis for its assessment, the Supervisory Board was guided, in particular, by the quantitative and qualitative metrics  defined  in  the  corporate  planning  that  had  been done before the beginning of the financial year. These met\u00ad rics  include,  for  example,  key  indicators  such  as  vehicle sales, segment shares and the share of sales for electrified vehicles, as well as other metrics for assessing sustainability performance, R&D rate, the quality of the customer experi\u00ad ence compared to the competition, investments in training and further education, targets for diversity in the workforce and the results of employee surveys. The results of compar\u00ad ative studies and calculations were also used to assess indi\u00ad vidual  metrics.  In  addition  to  a  review  of  performance  in 2021, the Supervisory Board carried out a trend review cov\u00ad ering several financial years. In doing so, it assessed the effects of decisions, measures and the overall course set in previous financial years on the financial year 2021 and, by way of a forecast, also estimated the significance of the per\u00ad formance in 2021 for the future development of the company.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF TARGETS OF THE PERFORMANCE COMPONENT OF THE BONUS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Individual assessment for each member of the Board of Management.\n- 2 Collective assessment of the Board of Management as a team.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  amount  depends  on  the achievement of certain financial and non\u00adfinancial targets in the past financial year (vesting year). The members of the Board of Management are obliged to invest their personal\n\ncash investment amounts (less taxes and duties) in BMW shares of common stock, and to hold these shares for a period of at least four years (Share Ownership Guideline). The obligation to purchase BMW shares of common stock and the multi\u00adyear holding period strengthens the entrepre\u00ad neurial long\u00adterm orientation of the Board of Management. Implementing the corporate strategy sustainably by taking appropriate  decisions  also  creates  lasting  value  for  the shareholders, and thus regularly provides the basis for posi\u00ad\n\ntive long\u00adterm capital market performance. Due to the sub\u00ad stantial investment and the fixed holding period associated with these shares, members of the Board of Management participate in the long\u00adterm positive (and negative) develop\u00ad ment of the company, as reflected in the share price, even after their departure.",

        "page_content": "## Personal cash investment amount\n\nThe personal cash investment amount is paid out after the Annual General Meeting at which the annual financial state\u00ad ments for the vesting year are presented. The size of this amount depends on the target amount, the RoCE achieved in the Automotive segment and the degree to which certain strategic focus targets were achieved in the vesting year. The personal cash investment amount is limited to a maximum of 180 % of the target amount and is calculated as follows:\n\nPersonal cash investment amount =\n\nRoCE component + strategic focus targets component\n\n## Target amount for the personal cash investment amount\n\nThe target amounts for the individual members of the Board of Management for the 2021 financial year are presented in the  table  'Overview  of  share\u00adbased  remuneration  for  the 2021 financial year', below.\n\n## RoCE component of the personal cash investment amount\n\nBefore the beginning of the relevant vesting year, the Super\u00ad visory Board sets minimum, target and maximum values for the RoCE in the Automotive segment in the vesting year on the basis of corporate planning, and assigns a RoCE factor to each of these values. If the minimum value is not reached, the RoCE factor is 0. If the target value is reached, the RoCE factor is 1.00. As of the achievement of the maximum value, the RoCE factor is 1.80. The RoCE component of the per\u00ad sonal investment cash amount is determined by multiplying the RoCE factor for the vesting year by 50 % of the individual target amount.\n\n## Strategic focus targets component of the personal cash invest\u00ad ment amount\n\nThe Supervisory Board sets at least two strategic focus tar\u00ad gets before the start of the vesting year. It derives these tar\u00ad gets from the corporate strategy and corporate planning. It then sets a minimum, target and maximum value for each\n\nstrategic focus target, and assigns a factor to each of these values. If the minimum value is not reached, the factor for that target is 0. If the target value is reached, the factor for that target is 1.00. As of the achievement of the maximum value, the factor for that target is 1.80. The strategic focus targets component of the personal cash investment amount is determined in a two\u00adstep process. In the first step, the fac\u00ad tor for the vesting year achieved for the relevant strategic focus target is multiplied by the share of the individual target amount attributable to this target. In the second step, the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvalues determined for the individual strategic focus targets using this calculation are added together. If two strategic focus targets are set, each strategic focus target accounts for 25 % of the individual target amount, unless the Supervi\u00ad sory Board decides on a different weighting. If more than two strategic focus targets are set, the Supervisory Board determines the weighting of each target.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF SHARE-BASED REMUNERATION\n\n1 Simplified depiction. Payment, acquisition of shares and the start of the four\u00adyear holding period occur following the Annual General Meeting at which the annual financial statements for the vesting year are presented.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Super\u00ad visory Board has determined the following values for the vesting year 2021: Minimum value: 10 %, Target value: 16 %, Maximum  value:  45 %.  The  RoCE  achieved  for  the  2021 financial year was 59.9 %, meaning that the maximum value set for the purposes of assessing the value of the RoCE com\u00ad ponent was exceeded and the RoCE factor for the calculation of the personal cash investment amount is 1.80 (its maxi\u00ad mum value). The target was set by the Supervisory Board in December 2020 on the basis of long\u00adterm corporate plan\u00ad ning. RoCE for the Automotive segment increased signifi\u00ad cantly in the  2021  financial  year,  to  59.9 %  (2020:\n\n## TARGETS SET AND EXTENT OF ACHIEVEMENT ROCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.7 % / +47.2 percentage points). This was driven in large part by increasing EBIT compared to the previous year. A reduction in capital employed, and specifically the reduction in average inventory during the financial year, was another contributing factor. This was due, in particular, to the rapid recovery of operational business from the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and the positive price effects for new and pre\u00adowned vehicles caused by the shortage of sup\u00ad ply due to the tense supply situation for semiconductors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Targets set and extent of achievement for the strategic focus targets component for the 2021 financial year\n\nIn December 2020, the Supervisory Board set the following strategic focus targets for the vesting year 2021, in accord\u00ad ance with the remuneration system:\n\n- - Reduce CO 2 fleet emissions in the EU according to WLTP; weighting  in  relation  to  personal  cash  investment amount: 25 %.\n- - Sales of all\u00adelectric vehicles (Battery Electric Vehicles, BEV); weighting in relation to personal cash investment amount: 12.5 %.\n- - Sales  of  plug\u00adin  hybrid  vehicles  (PHEV);  weighting  in relation to personal cash investment amount: 12.5 %.\n\n## TARGETS SET AND EXTENT OF ACHIEVEMENT REDUCTION OF FLEET CARBON EMISSIONS (EU) 1\n\n<!-- image -->",

The actual value for the 2021 financial year was 115.9 CO 2 g / km, so the target was 91 % achieved. The CO 2 fleet value achieved (after setting an ambi\u00ad tious original target), thus is below the legal limit of 125.8 CO 2 g / km by 9.9 CO 2 g / km in 2021.\n\nFor  sales  of  all\u00adelectric  vehicles  (BEV),  the  Supervisory Board set the following reference values in units for the vest\u00ad ing year 2021: Minimum value: 75,000 units, Target value:\n\n101,000 units, Maximum value: 170,000 units. The actual value for the 2021 financial year was 103,854 units, so the target was 103 % achieved.\n\nFor sales of plug\u00adin hybrid vehicles (PHEV), the Supervisory Board set the following reference values in units for the 2021 vesting year: Minimum value: 180,000 units, Target value: 241,000 units, Maximum value: 400,000 units. The actual value for the 2021 financial year was 224,460 units, so the target was 86 % achieved.\n\nThe personal investment cash amount for the vesting year 2021 will be paid out after the Annual General Meeting 2022, at which the Financial Statements of BMW AG for the finan\u00ad cial year 2021 will be presented.\n\n## TARGETS SET AND EXTENT OF ACHIEVEMENT BEV SALES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TARGETS SET AND EXTENT OF ACHIEVEMENT PHEV SALES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shareholding  rules\n\nThe members of the Board of Management in office as at 31 December 2021 hold a total of 58,560 BMW shares of com\u00ad mon stock which they are required to hold in accordance with the terms of the share\u00adbased remuneration programmes for the financial years 2017- 2020.\n\nThe share\u00adbased remuneration (investment component) for the vesting year 2020 was paid out in 2021, immediately after which the BMW shares of common stock were acquired.\n\n## 6. Retirement  benefits\n\nThe retirement benefits system provides for annual contribu\u00ad tions by the company with a guaranteed minimum interest rate  equal  to  the  maximum  interest  rate  specified  in  the German  actuarial  reserve  regulation  (Deckungsr\u00fcckstel\u00ad lungsverordnung).  Commitments  to  pay  annual  contribu\u00ad tions to the company pension scheme are linked to the term of appointment as a member of the Board of Management. Pension entitlements become vested when the employment relationship has existed for one year. If a mandate is termi\u00ad nated, the defined contribution system provides, in the case of death or invalidity, for amounts accumulated on individual pension accounts to be paid out as a one\u00adoff amount or in instalments.\n\nAs regards pension commitments, retired members of the Board of Management are entitled to retirement benefits at the age of 62 at the earliest. The amount of the benefits to be paid is determined on the basis of the amount accrued in each Board member's individual pension savings account. This figure is in turn based on the annual contributions and an annual interest rate depending on the form of investment. The payment is made as a lump sum or in annual instal\u00ad ments at the discretion of the member of the Board of Man\u00ad agement. For entitlements arising before 2016, there is an option to receive payment as a lifelong pension or in a com\u00ad bined form.

Malus and clawback provisions\n\nThe remuneration system applied since 2021 provides for the possibility of withholding variable remuneration (malus) and reclaiming  variable  remuneration  already  paid  out  (claw\u00ad back) under certain conditions. The rules allow the Supervi\u00ad sory Board to withhold or reclaim variable remuneration in the event of certain serious compliance\u00adrelated violations (compliance  malus  and / or  compliance  clawback).  These provisions can also be applied where variable remuneration components  linked  to  the  achievement  of  certain  targets have  been  paid  out  on  the  basis  of  incorrect  calculation bases or incorrect financial statements. Remuneration can also be withheld or reclaimed after an individual's departure from the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has not identified any reason to with\u00ad hold or reclaim variable remuneration components in the 2021 financial year.\n\n## 8. Regulations in the event of death, invalidity and post\u00adcon\u00ad tractual non\u00adcompetition clause\n\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special regulations apply regarding the early maturity of Performance Cash Plans and share\u00adbased remuneration components (matching compo\u00ad nents)  based  on  target  amounts.  Where  the  contract  of employment  is  terminated  prematurely  and  the  company has an extraordinary right of termination, or if the Board member resigns without the company's agreement, entitle\u00ad ments to amounts as yet unpaid relating to performance cash plans and share\u00adbased remuneration (matching com\u00ad ponents) are forfeited. The other variable remuneration com\u00ad ponents (bonus, personal cash investment amount) are set\u00ad tled on the basis of the target amounts.\n\nA one\u00adyear post\u00adcontractual non\u00adcompetition clause has been agreed with the Board members under specified\n\ncircumstances  against  payment  of  a  remuneration amount. Contracts of employment provide for the pay\u00ad ment of a monthly waiting allowance in the amount of the applicable monthly basic remuneration for the dura\u00ad tion of the post\u00adcontractual non\u00adcompetition clause. In accordance  with  the  recommendation  of  the  German Corporate Governance Code dated 16 December 2019, any severance payment is offset against the non\u00adcom\u00ad petition clause remuneration amount. The same applies to other income from third parties, except remuneration for Supervisory Board appointments approved during the term of office. The company may unilaterally waive the requirement to comply with the post\u00adcontractual non\u00adcompetition clause.\n\nDr. Wendt left the Board of Management on 31 December 2021. For the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022,  the  waiting  allowance  contractually  owed  to  him amounts  to  approximately  \u20ac  1.1 million.  A  provision  was made for this.\n\n## 9. Remuneration granted and owed to members of the Board of Management pursuant to \u00a7 162 of the German Stock Corpora\u00ad tion Act (AktG)\n\nThe  following  tables  ( \u2197 'Presentation  of  remuneration  granted  and owed' ) show the fixed and variable remuneration granted and owed to the members of the Board of Management in the reporting year in accordance with \u00a7 162 AktG.\n\nThe tables include all amounts received by the individual members  of  the  Board  of  Management  in  the  reporting period ('remuneration granted') and all remuneration legally due but not yet received ('remuneration owed').\n\nIn  addition  to  actual  amounts  received,  'remuneration granted' in the reporting year is also assumed if the activity on which the remuneration component is based has been fully performed by the member of the Board of Management as of the balance sheet date, and if all conditions for the\n\n## PENSION ENTITLEMENTS\n\n| in \u20ac        | Service cost in  accordance  with   IFRS for the   financial year 2021   | Cash value of entitle\u00ad ments to pension benefits  in accordance with IFRS  as at 31 December 2021   |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 702,274     | 4,644,382                                                                | Oliver Zipse                                                                                       |\n| (502,626)   | 4,644,382                                                                | (3,701,016)                                                                                        |\n| 401,765     | 1,953,670                                                                | Ilka Horstmeier                                                                                    |\n| (352,433)   | (1,391,936)                                                              | Ilka Horstmeier                                                                                    |\n| 401,466     | 2,441,046                                                                | Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107                                                                                  |\n| (352,121)   | (1,830,168)                                                              | Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107                                                                                  |\n| 402,852     | 1,632,365                                                                | Pieter Nota                                                                                        |\n| (354,680)   | (1,157,145)                                                              | Pieter Nota                                                                                        |\n| 401,099     | 3,731,163                                                                | Nicolas Peter                                                                                      |\n| (351,746)   | (3,134,163)                                                              | Nicolas Peter                                                                                      |\n| 402,075     | 1,100,507                                                                | Frank Weber                                                                                        |\n| (175,000)   | (655,460)                                                                | Frank Weber                                                                                        |\n| 401,099     | 3,379,883                                                                | Andreas Wendt                                                                                      |\n| (351,746)   | (2,863,441)                                                              | Andreas Wendt                                                                                      |\n| 3,112,630   | 18,883,016                                                               | Total  1                                                                                           |\n| (2,615,352) |                                                                          | (18,289,989)                                                                                       |\n\n- 1 Disclosures for the previous year include amounts relating to members of the Board of Management who left office during the financial year 2020.\n\naccrual of entitlement (e. g. the expiry of assessment peri\u00ad ods  or  the  non\u00adoccurrence  of  forfeiture  conditions)  have occurred.",

In  addition,  it  includes  remuneration  components already earned as a result of activity in previous financial years, but for which the respective member of the Board of Management's payment entitlement only arose due to the occurrence of conditions or at the end of the 2021 financial year.\n\nIn addition to the amount of remuneration, the relative share of the relevant remuneration component in the total remu\u00ad neration granted and owed is also shown.

The maxi\u00ad mum amount that can be paid to a Board member is capped at 180 % of the PCP target amount p. a.\n\nIn order to determine the multi\u00adyear earnings factor, an earn\u00ad ings factor is calculated for each year of the three\u00adyear eval\u00ad uation period and an average is then calculated for the eval\u00ad uation period. The earnings factor for the individual year of the assessment period is determined on the basis of the Group's consolidated net profit and the consolidated return on sales after tax for the assessment year concerned, and can amount to a maximum of 1.800. The underlying meas\u00ad urement values are determined in advance for a period of three financial years, and may not be changed retrospec\u00ad tively.\n\nIn addition to the multi\u00adyear earnings factor, the Supervisory Board also sets a multi\u00adyear performance factor after the end of the evaluation period. To this end, the Supervisory Board takes account in particular of the development of the busi\u00ad ness during the evaluation period, the forecast trend in the development of the business, the Board member's individual contribution  to  profitability  and  the  status  of  compliance within the Board member's area of responsibility. The mul\u00ad ti\u00adyear performance factor can be between 0.9 and 1.1.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management in office as at 1 January 2018 received an advance payment from the Per\u00ad formance Cash Plan 2019- 2021 in 2020. The advance pay\u00ad ment amounted to \u20ac 0.5 million for a Board of Management member in their first appointment period, and \u20ac 0.6 million from the second appointment period or the fourth year of appointment. For the Chairman of the Board of Manage\u00ad ment, the advance payment was \u20ac 0.9 million. At the end of the assessment period, the advance payments will be set off or refunded, depending on the actual entitlement arising.\n\nThe Performance Cash Plan 2019- 2021 was approved for the performance of the Members of the Board of Manage\u00ad ment in the 2019 financial year. As at the balance sheet date of the reporting year, the three\u00adyear assessment period of this remuneration component, which was subject to certain forfeiture provisions, had expired.\n\nIn the 2021 financial year, a consolidated net profit of \u20ac 12.5 billion and a consolidated return on sales after tax of 11.2 % were achieved. For both indicators, the defined maximum values were thus exceeded, meaning that the earnings factor was capped at the maximum value of 1.800 (corresponding to a target being 180 % achieved, the maximum possible percentage). Based on the earnings factors for the individual years of the assessment period (financial year 2019: 0.798, financial year 2020: 0.444, financial year 2021: 1.800), the multi\u00adyear performance factor is 1.014.

In  the  financial  year  2021,  the matching component of the share\u00adbased remuneration of the vesting year 2016 was paid out.\n\nUnder  the  share\u00adbased  remuneration  programme  for  the financial year 2016, the members of the Board of Manage\u00ad ment were each required to invest an amount equal to 20 % of  the  total  bonuses  they  received  from  the  company  as additional  cash  remuneration  for  the  financial  year  2016, which were paid exclusive of taxes and social security contri\u00ad butions (the investment component) in shares of the compa\u00ad ny's common stock. In principle, the members of the Board of Management must hold these shares of common stock for at least four years. Under a matching plan, the member of the Board of Management receives from the company - at the  company's  discretion  -  either  an  additional  share  of common stock or the equivalent in cash (share\u00adbased remu\u00ad neration component / matching component) for every three shares  of  common  stock  held  after  the  four\u00adyear  holding period.\n\nThe investment component for the 2016 financial year was paid out immediately after the 2017 Annual General Meeting on  11  May  2017,  and  the  shares  of  common  stock  were acquired on 12 May 2017. Therefore, the holding period for the\n\nacquired shares of common stock expired on 11 May 2021. The company settled the matching component in cash, and paid out the equivalent value of the matching shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## d) Presentation of remuneration granted and owed\n\nThe following tables show the remuneration granted and owed to the members of the Board of Management.\n\n## EARNINGS COMPONENTS: ALLOCATION TABLE FOR CALCULATING EARNINGS FACTOR FOR 2019-2021 1\n\n1 Simplified depiction 2 Earnings factor 2019 3 Earnings factor 2020 4 Earnings factor 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PERFORMANCE CASH PLAN 2019-2021\n\n| in \u20ac                   | Target amount   | Total amount PCP  2019-2021   | Advance payment  1   | PCP factor Remuneration   (payment amount   PCP 2019-2021)   |\n|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1,194,624              | 1.014           | 1,211,349  712,900            | 498,449              | Oliver Zipse                                                 |\n| 141,667                | 1.014           | 143,650   (-)                 | 143,650              | Ilka Horstmeier                                              |\n| 212,500                | 1.014           | 215,475                       | (-)   215,475        | Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107                                            |\n| Nicolas Peter  850,000 | 1.014           | 861,900                       | 500,000              | 361,900                                                      |\n| Pieter Nota  850,000   | 1.014           |                               | 500,000  361,900     | 861,900                                                      |\n| (-)                    | (-)             | (-)                           | (-)   (-)            | Frank Weber                                                  |\n| Andreas Wendt  850,000 | 1.014           | 861,900                       | (-)                  | 861,900                                                      |\n\n- 1 The advance payment was paid out in 2020.",

Articles of Incorporation and procedure\n\nThe regulation governing remuneration for the Supervisory Board applicable to the reporting year was adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2020. It is set out in Arti\u00ad cle 15 of the Articles of Incorporation, and specifies both the remuneration system to be used and the precise framework for calculating the remuneration due to the members of the Supervisory  Board.  The  regulation  was  confirmed  by  the Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2021 with a majority of 99.40 % of the valid votes cast.\n\n## 2. Principles and elements of remuneration\n\nWith effect from the 2020 financial year, remuneration for members of the Supervisory Board has been structured as purely  fixed  remuneration,  and  complies  with  Suggestion G.18 of the German Corporate Governance Code as amended on 16 December 2019. This strengthens the independence of the Supervisory Board in advising and monitoring the Board of  Management.  The  structure  and  amount  of  the  fixed remuneration  ensure  that  highly  qualified  individuals  can continue to be proposed to the Annual General Meeting for membership of the Supervisory Board. This strengthens its advisory and supervisory function, which contributes to the company's sustainable and long\u00adterm development.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, each mem\u00ad ber of the Supervisory Board of BMW AG who does not exer\u00ad cise  any  additional  function  relevant  to  remuneration receives - in addition to the reimbursement of reasonable expenses - fixed remuneration of \u20ac 200,000 p.a.\n\nThe latest version of the GCCC, dated 16 December 2019, recommends that exercising the functions of the chair and deputy chair of Supervisory Board should also be considered when determining the level of remuneration, along with any committees an individual chairs or sits on (Suggestion G.17). This is to take account of the extra time commitment associ\u00ad\n\nated with these positions. In view of the particular demands placed on the members and, in particular, on the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the increased scope of the Audit Committee's tasks, a higher level of remuneration is pro\u00ad vided for work on this committee than for work on other com\u00ad mittees. Accordingly, the Articles of Incorporation of BMW AG stipulate that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board shall receive three times the amount and each Deputy Chair\u00ad man twice the amount of remuneration paid to a Supervisory Board  member,  excluding  amounts  relating  to  additional remuneration\u00adrelevant  functions.  The  Chair  of  the  Audit Committee receives two\u00adand\u00ada\u00adquarter times the amount, the Chair of other Supervisory Board committees twice the amount,  each  member  of  the  Audit  Committee  twice  the amount, and each member of another committee one\u00adand\u00ad a\u00adhalf times the amount of the remuneration paid to a Super\u00ad visory Board member, provided the relevant committee con\u00ad vened on at least three days during the financial year. If a member of the Supervisory Board exercises more than one of  the  functions  referred  to  above,  their  remuneration  is measured only on the basis of the function receiving the highest amount.\n\nIn the event of changes in the composition of the Supervi\u00ad sory Board during the year, or if additional remuneration\u00adrel\u00ad evant functions are performed, remuneration is determined on a proportionate basis.\n\nIn addition, each member of the Supervisory Board receives an attendance fee of \u20ac 2,000 per meeting for each meeting of the Supervisory Board (plenary) in which he or she partic\u00ad ipates.  This  also  applies  to  participation  by  telephone  or video link. If they attend more than one meeting on the same day, the meetings are not remunerated separately.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Incorpo\u00ad ration, the remuneration and the attendance fee are only paid after the end of the respective financial year. Further\u00ad more, the company reimburses each member of the Super\u00ad\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvisory Board for their reasonable expenses. In order to be able to perform his duties, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is provided with secretariat and chauffeur services.\n\n## 3.

Comparison of change in remuneration and earnings pursuant to \u00a7 162 (1) Sentence 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 162 (1) Sentence 2 No. 2 AktG, the following table shows the change in earnings, the annual change in the remuneration of the members of the Board of Manage\u00ad ment and the Supervisory Board, and the annual change in the average remuneration of the employees on a full\u00adtime equivalent basis over the last five financial years.\n\nFor  the  members  of  the  Board  of  Management  and  the Supervisory Board, the remuneration granted and owed in the relevant financial year is presented within the meaning of \u00a7 162 (1) Sentence 1 AktG. The remuneration granted and owed  to  former  members  of  the  Board  of  Management includes any variable remuneration from previous vesting years and any remuneration from any contracts of employ\u00ad ment that remained valid beyond the end of their mandate, as well as retirement benefit plans (pension payments, pay\u00ad ments from the capital account), other remuneration and any waiting allowances paid.\n\nThe change in earnings is presented on the basis of BMW AG's net profit for the year in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB). In addition, the changes in the key indicators  'earnings  attributable  to  shareholders  of  BMW AG' and 'Group post\u00adtax return on sales' are reported, as these key indicators are relevant to the calculation of the var\u00ad iable remuneration of the members of the Board of Manage\u00ad ment (earnings component of the bonus).\n\nThe  presentation  of  average  employee  remuneration  is based  on  the  average  remuneration  of  all  employees  of BMW AG on a full\u00adtime equivalent basis. In the 2021 financial year, this was 78,144 people. As of 31 December 2021, BMW Group  employed  118,909  people  worldwide.  The  compo\u00ad nents of the average employee remuneration presented are generally in line with the remuneration granted and owed to the members of the Board of Management and the Supervi\u00ad sory Board according to \u00a7 162 (1) Sentence 1 AktG.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other  considerations\n\nBMW AG did not grant any loans to members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board in the financial year 2021, nor did it enter into any contingent liabilities in their favour. In the year under review, members of the Board of Management  and  the  Supervisory  Board  concluded  con\u00ad tracts with BMW Group companies for vehicle leasing and vehicle  services  (maintenance  and  repair  work)  at  arm's length conditions.\n\nThe company maintains a financial loss liability insurance policy for company directors. The insurance provides cover for legal liability claims and protects the private assets of members of BMW AG's corporate entities if a claim is made against them for financial loss in the course of exercising their function as a corporate entity. A deductible is provided for members of the Board of Management that complies with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\n## VI.  Outlook for the 2022 financial year\n\nIn principle, the current remuneration system for members of the Board of Management will apply unchanged for the 2022 financial year.\n\nUnder this system, 50 % of the share\u00adbased remuneration as  a  long\u00adterm  component  of  the  variable  remuneration depends on the RoCE achieved in the Automotive segment in the relevant vesting year. For the financial year 2021, the RoCE is defined as the segment profit before financial result, divided by the average capital employed in the segment. The definition  of  this  key  indicator  has  been  adjusted  for  the financial  year  2022.  Previously,  'capital  employed'  com\u00ad prised  the  sum  of  all  current  and  non\u00adcurrent  operating assets, adjusted for deductible capital. The deductible capi\u00ad tal corresponded to the capital shares that were available to the  operational  business,  largely  without  interest.  This included, for example, trade payables and other provisions. In future, the definition of capital employed will include the\n\nsum of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and net working capital. This simplified definition aims to make this indicator more transparent and easier to understand. In addition,  the  capital  employed  items  taken  into  account reflect the focus of operational segment management. The new definition leads to an increase in capital employed com\u00ad pared to the previous definition. The strategic target value for the RoCE in the Automotive segment according to the new definition will therefore be 18 % from the financial year 2022 onwards (previous year: 40 %). In terms of content, this amounts to an even more ambitious objective compared to the previous measurement of return on capital.\n\nThere are no plans to change the remuneration system for members of the Supervisory Board for the 2022 financial year,\n\nBayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft\n\nFor the Supervisory Board\n\nFor the Board of Management\n\nDr.\u00adIng.

Auditor's Report\n\nTo Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft Munich\n\nRemuneration Report pursuant to \u00a7 162 AktG for the Finan\u00ad cial Year from January 1 to December 31, 2021\n\n## Auditor's Report\n\nTo Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, Munich\n\nWe  have  audited  the  remuneration  report  of  Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, Munich, for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2021 including the related disclosures,  which  was  prepared  to  comply  with  \u00a7  [Arti\u00ad cle] 162 AktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act].\n\n## Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board\n\nThe executive directors and the supervisory board of Bayer\u00ad ische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the  preparation  of  the  remuneration  report,  including  the related disclosures, that complies with the requirements of \u00a7  162  AktG.  The  executive  directors  and  the  supervisory board are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a remu\u00ad neration report, including the related disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remunera\u00ad tion report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial state\u00ad ments promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (Insti\u00ad tute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report, including the related disclo\u00ad sures, is free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evi\u00ad dence about the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the remuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment. This includes the assess\u00ad ment of the risks of material misstatement of the remunera\u00ad tion report including the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the remunera\u00ad tion report including the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appro\u00ad priate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appro\u00ad priateness of accounting policies used and the reasonable\u00ad ness of accounting estimates made by the executive direc\u00ad tors and the supervisory board, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation  of  remuneration  report  including  the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi\u00ad cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Audit Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remu\u00ad neration  report  for  the  financial  year  from  January  1  to December 31, 2021, including the related disclosures, com\u00ad plies in all material respects with the accounting provisions of \u00a7 162 AktG.\n\n## Reference to an Other Matter - Formal Audit of the Remuneration Report according to \u00a7 162 AktG\n\nThe audit of the content of the remuneration report described in this auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remu\u00ad neration report required by \u00a7 162 Abs. [paragraph] 3 AktG, including  the  issuance  of  a  report  on  this  audit.  As  we express an unqualified audit opinion on the content of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nremuneration  report,  this  audit  opinion  includes  that  the information required by \u00a7 162 Abs. 1 and 2 AktG has been disclosed in all material respects in the remuneration report.\n\n## Restriction on use\n\nWe issue this auditor's report on the basis of the engage\u00ad ment  agreed  with  Bayerische  Motoren  Werke  Aktienge\u00ad sellschaft. The audit has been performed only for purposes of the company and the auditor's report is solely intended to inform  the  company  as  to  the  results  of  the  audit.  Our responsibility for the audit and for our auditor's report is only towards the company in accordance with this engagement. The auditor's report is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decisions thereon. We do not assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards third par\u00ad ties; no third parties are included in the scope of protection of the underlying engagement.

For these reasons, a direct comparison with 2017 and 2018 figures is not possible.\n- 2 The emissions listed account for approximately 90% of the BMW Group's total Scope 1 to Scope 3 emissions.\n- 3 Carbon emissions (disregarding climate\u00adimpacting gases apart from carbon dioxide) generated by vehicle production (BMW Group plants including the BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. joint venture and motorcycle production, but excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) and by other BMW Group locations not directly related to production (e.g. research centres, sales centres, office buildings).\n- 4 From 2021, this indicator also includes the carbon emissions generated by other BMW Group locations as well as those relating to production. For comparison purposes, the figures for 2019 (base year) and 2020 have been adjusted accordingly. The figures for 2017 and 2018 are therefore not directly comparable.\n- 5 Calculation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, using the operational control approach in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Leased office space without the direct influence of the BMW Group on energy supply is therefore not included.\n- 6 Scope 2 emissions calculated using the market\u00adbased method in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance; mainly the use of VDA emissions factors and in some cases the use of local emissions factors; alternative calculation using the location\u00adbased method: 1,404,348 t CO2.\n- 7 Includes all refuelling of function\u00adrelabel vehicles within Germany and at major international locations (e.g. test sites in the USA, Sweden and France). All refuellings of company vehicles in Germany and, since November 2021, throughout Europe are also included. The latter include both business and private trips, except refuel\u00ad ling paid for privately by employees.\n- 8 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also included on a pro\u00adrata basis under employee commuting and use phase (both Scope 3). A system\u00adrelated delimitation is not currently possible.\n- 9 Biomethane certificates amounting to 164,000 MWh are taken into account in this indicator.

Use and modelling of emissions factors primarily in accordance with DIN EN 16258 as well as figures from CleanCargo and JEC5; in some cases, extrapolations have been used for individual months.\n- 5 Scope expanded to include the Greer packaging plant (South Carolina, USA) to supply production and distribute Rolls\u00adRoyce vehicles. The figures for 2021 are therefore not directly comparable with previous years.\n- 6 Includes air travel, train travel and rental cars.\n- 7 The figures from 2020 onwards are not directly comparable with previous years due to the improved data basis. In some cases, figures have been extrapolated based on surveys conducted at major national and international BMW Group locations.\n- 8 Based on life cycle assessments in accordance with ISO 14040/44 of representative vehicles of the product lines using the LCA tool GaBi provided by the company Thinkstep (including the climate\u00adimpacting gases CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, NF3). Corresponding to the CO2e emissions, the life cycle assessments show the energy consump\u00ad tion (lower calorific value): around 86,095,113 MWh in the category 'Bought\u00adin goods and services' and around 600,049 MWh in the category 'Waste disposal'.\n- 9 Use\u00adphase emissions are based on global average fleet emissions. For definition, see glossary \u2197 carbon emissions of new vehicle fleet worldwide, including upstream emissions. The calculation is based on an average mileage of 200,000 km.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Against a  backdrop of increasing electrification, it is particularly  important to consider carbon emissions over the entire  life cycle of a vehicle. In this context, the BMW Group  has set itself decarbonisation targets by 2030 (base  year 2019) during the use phase, in the upstream supply  chain and in production. These targets were notified  to the SBTi and validated ( \u2197 Decarbonisation targets across  the value chain) . The BMW Group is also taking measures  to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It is there\u00ad fore imperative to identify climate\u00adrelated risks and  opportunities and to take appropriate account of them  in determining the strategic direction to be followed,                                                                                                      |\n| Material Sourcing                 | Description of the management of  risks associated with the use of critical  materials          | Discussion and Analysis | n / a           | TR\u00adAU\u00ad440a.1 | hicles, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide  (CO) and particulate matter (PM) ( \u2197 pollutant emissions ).  In order to meet the respective due diligence require\u00ad ments in terms of environmental and social standards,  we rely on systematic risk analyses as well as preven\u00ad tion, empowerment and remediation measures. Moreover,  the BMW Group enshrines its obligatory sustainability  standards in all its supply contracts. Sourcing the raw  materials required to produce battery cells, such as  lithium and cobalt, is generally a highly challenging task.  In order to establish traceability and transparency across  the supply chain for both of these raw materials and to  minimise the identified risks, the BMW Group sources  them directly from the producers and makes them avail\u00ad able to its own suppliers in order to produce the current  generation of battery cells.

This information is based on a vehicle with basic equipment in Germany; ranges take into account differ\u00ad ences in wheel and tyre size selected as well as optional equipment and can change based on configuration. The figures have been calculated based on the new WLTP test cycle and adapted to NEDC for comparison purposes. For vehicles that were newly type approved on or after January 1, 2021,\n\nofficial figures are only based on WLTP. In the vehicles, different figures than those published here may apply for the assessment of taxes and other vehicle\u00adrelated duties which are also based on CO 2 emissions.

For further information on retail vehicle delivery data, please see \u2197 Comparison of Forecasts with Actual Outcomes .\n- 3 Excluding Husqvarna, deliveries up to 2013: 59,776 units; production up to 2013: 59,426 units.\n- 4 Since the reporting year 2020, a new definition for workforce size has been applied ( \u2197 Glossary ). To enable better comparability, the value for 2019 was adjusted accordingly (2019 before adjustment: 133,778 employees).\n- For the timeframe including and prior to 2018, the share of the employees that are no longer reflected in reporting is about 7.5\u00ad8 %.\n- 5 Proposal by management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This excludes ap\u00ad prentices, interns, temporary staff (working students), tem\u00ad porary employees, dormant / inactive employment contracts due to maternity leave, sabbaticals, parental leave, long\u00ad term illness (as defined in the country in question), those in inactive early retirement phase, and employees accompany\u00ad ing their partner abroad. Up to 2019, temporary staff, post\u00ad graduate students, interns, apprentices, and people on ex\u00ad\n\ntended sick leave or on sabbatical were also included in this definition.\n\n## Bond\n\nA securitised debt instrument in which the issuer certifies its obligation to repay the nominal amount at the end of a fixed term and to pay a fixed or variable rate of interest.\n\n## Business volume in balance sheet terms\n\nThe sum of the balance sheet line items 'Leased products' and 'Receivables from sales financing' (current and non\u00adcur\u00ad rent), as reported in the balance sheet for the Financial Ser\u00ad vices segment.\n\nC\n\n## Capital expenditure ratio\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment and other in\u00ad tangible assets (excluding capitalised development costs) as a percentage of Group revenues.\n\n## Capitalisation rate\n\nCapitalised development costs as a percentage of research and development expenditure.\n\n## Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet in the EU\n\nThe average carbon emissions of a manufacturer's fleet are calculated on the basis of the weighted average of carbon emissions across all vehicles newly registered during the re\u00ad\n\nGlossary and Explanation of Key Figures\n\nporting period. New registrations for these purposes com\u00ad prise all newly registered vehicles of a given manufacturer in the EU, including Norway and Iceland, during the calendar year, plus any individual vehicle\u00adspecific carbon emissions determined in accordance with the WLTP type test proce\u00ad dure. The BMW Group's fleet carbon emissions figure for 2021, as measured internally, includes legally permitted off\u00ad setting of eco\u00adinnovations.\n\n## Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet worldwide, including upstream emissions\n\nThis  indicator  documents  the  progress  made  by  the BMW Group  in  its  strategic  objective  of  reducing  carbon emissions during the utilisation phase including upstream emissions (drivetrain energy supply) by an average rate of more than 50 % per kilometre driven by 2030 (base year 2019). For the purpose of this calculation, the volume\u00adweight\u00ad ed average fleet carbon emissions are calculated for the core markets EU (27 EU countries incl. Norway and Iceland; plus UK)  (driving  cycle:  Worldwide  Harmonized  Light  Vehicles Test Procedure; basis: production volume), USA (driving cy\u00ad cle: United States Combined; basis: production volume) and China (driving cycle: Worldwide Harmonized Test Cycle, sub\u00ad ject to China\u00adspecific framework conditions for testing; ba\u00ad sis:  import  volumes / local  production  volumes;  incl.  joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.) before deduction of legally  permitted  offsetting  factors  (e. g.  supercredits  and eco\u00adinnovations)  and  then  standardised  according  to  the WLTP (European) driving cycle.

This indicator also includes the upstream emissions for the respective en\u00ad ergy sources (fossil fuels and electricity used for charging), in line with the well\u00adto\u00adwheel approach. This covers the entire causal chain behind vehicle motion, i. e. from the generation and supply of power to its conversion into drivetrain energy. This approach also includes the environmental impacts as\u00ad sociated with the supply of energy. For example, to calculate the volume of emissions resulting from upstream electricity (drivetrain energy supply), the BMW Group uses the energy report published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) as a basis in order to assess the emissions associated with the electricity mix in its core markets.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nLiquid funds generated (cash inflows) or used (cash out\u00ad flows) during a reporting period.\n\n## Cash flow at risk\n\nSimilar to 'value at risk' (see definition below).\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nHedges against exposures to the variability in forecasted cash  flows,  particularly  in  connection  with  exchange  rate fluctuations.\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nShort\u00adterm debt instruments with a term of less than one year which are usually issued at a discount to their face val\u00ad ue.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe process of combining separate financial statements of Group entities into Group Financial Statements, depicting\n\nthe financial position, net assets and results of operations of the Group as a single economic entity.\n\n## Credit default swap (CDS)\n\nFinancial swap agreements, under which creditors of securi\u00ad ties (usually bonds) pay premiums to the seller of the CDS to hedge against the risk that the issuer of the bond will default. As with credit default insurance agreements, the party re\u00ad ceiving the premiums gives a commitment to compensate the bond creditor in the event of default.\n\n## D\n\n## Deliveries\n\nA new or used vehicle will be recorded as a delivery once handed over to the end user. End users also include lease\u00ad holders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services and - in the US and Canada - dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle. In the case of used vehicles, end users may include dealers and other third parties when they purchase a vehicle at auction or directly from the BMW Group. Vehicles designated for the end user and suffering total loss in transit will also be record\u00ad ed as deliveries. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent dealers. The vast majority of deliveries - and hence the reporting to BMW Group of deliveries - are made by independent dealers. In the US and Canada, the period start and end dates for the reporting of deliveries may imma\u00ad terially deviate from the beginning and, respectively, end of calendar years or calendar quarters and instead follow in\u00ad dustry\u00adstandard reporting calendars.\n\nGlossary and Explanation of Key Figures\n\n## E\n\n## Earnings per share (EPS)\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated for common and preferred stock by dividing the net profit after minority inter\u00ad ests, as attributable to each category of stock, by the aver\u00ad age number of shares in circulation. Earnings per share of preferred stock are computed on the basis of the number of preferred stock shares entitled to receive a dividend in each of the relevant financial years.\n\n## EBIT\n\nAbbreviation for 'Earnings Before Interest and  Taxes', equiv\u00ad alent in the BMW Group income statement to 'Profit / loss before financial result'. This is comprised of revenues less cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses and the net amount of other operating income and expenses.\n\n## EBIT margin\n\nProfit / loss before financial result as a percentage of reve\u00ad nues.\n\n## EBT\n\nEBIT plus financial result.\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax expense by the Group profit before tax.\n\n## Electrified vehicles\n\nThe  BMW  Group  uses  the  terms  Battery  Electric  Vehicle (BEV) to denote fully electric vehicles and Plug\u00adin Hybrid Ve\u00ad hicle (PHEV) to denote vehicles that can be charged and also driven on a fully electric basis.",

In its activities, the BMW Group stresses the avoidance of carbon emissions over compensa\u00ad tion. Unavoidable carbon emissions are neutralised in ac\u00ad counting terms by means of offsetting. Offsetting involves purchasing certificates on the voluntary carbon market and thus goes beyond the carbon offsetting approach which is implemented  via  the  European  Union  Emissions  Trading System (ETS). Criteria such as additionality, permanence, additional social benefits (e. g. will the avoidance of open fires in enclosed spaces provide health benefits), certifica\u00ad tion,  transparency  and  the  avoidance  of  double  counting contribute to the quality of the certificates used and thus to the effectiveness of offsetting.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe BMW Group uses the following terminology and ranges when forecasting key performance indicators:\n\nAt previous year's level\n\n[- 0.9 % / + 0.9 %]\n\nSlight increase\n\n[+ 1.0 % / + 4.9 %]\n\nSlight decrease\n\n[- 1.0 % / - 4.9 %]\n\nSolid increase\n\n[+ 5.0 % / + 9.9 %]\n\nModerate decrease\n\n[- 5.0 % / - 9.9 %]\n\nSignificant  increase\n\n> = + 10.0 %\n\nSignificant decrease\n\n> = - 10.0 %\n\nUnlike the other key performance indicators, the RoCE fore\u00ad cast for the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is based on the change in percentage points:\n\nAt previous year's level\n\n[- 0.9 %\u00adpts. / + 0.9 %\u00adpts.]\n\nSlight increase\n\n[+ 1.0 %\u00adpts. / + 4.9 %\u00adpts.]\n\nSlight decrease\n\n[- 1.0 %\u00adpts. / - 4.9 %\u00adpts.]\n\nSolid increase\n\n[+ 5.0 %\u00adpts. / + 9.9 %\u00adpts.]\n\nModerate decrease\n\n[- 5.0 %\u00adpts. / - 9.9 %\u00adpts.]\n\nSignificant  increase\n\n> = + 10.0 %\u00adpts.\n\nSignificant decrease\n\n> = - 10.0 %\u00adpts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## P\n\n## Part time, full time\n\nThe number of employees (see definition of 'Employees'), distinguishing between employees who have contractually stipulated weekly working hours as prescribed by law, in a collective wage agreement or by the company in question (full time) and employees with a contractually stipulated re\u00ad duction in their number of weekly working hours, which are thus less than the respective number of full\u00adtime working hours (part time).\n\nGlossary and Explanation of Key Figures\n\n## Payout ratio\n\nRatio of unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB to net profit for the year of the BMW Group in accord\u00ad ance with IFRS.\n\n## People on extended sick leave\n\nThe  number  of  people  with  active  employment  contracts who are absent from work on grounds of illness for an ex\u00ad tended period of time (as defined in the country in question - in Germany, this means an absence of more than 42 calen\u00ad dar days with a given illness).\n\n## Post\u00adtax return on sales\n\nGroup net profit as a percentage of Group revenues.\n\n## Pre\u00adtax return on sales\n\nGroup profit / loss before tax as a percentage of Group reve\u00ad nues.\n\n## R\n\n## Research and development expenditure\n\nThe sum of research and non\u00adcapitalised development cost and capitalised development cost (not including the associ\u00ad ated scheduled amortisation).\n\n## Research and development expenditure ratio\n\nResearch and development expenditure as a percentage of Group revenues.\n\n## Research and development locations\n\nThe engineering, IT and process expertise required for the (pre\u00ad)development  of  hardware  and  software  for  all BMW  Group  products  and  services  is  combined  at  the Group's international research and development locations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non\u00adcurrent operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.\n\n## Return on equity (RoE)\n\nRoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as seg\u00ad ment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital - at the end of the last five quarters - attribut\u00ad able to the Financial Services segment.\n\nS\n\n## Sabbatical\n\nThe  number  of  people  with  active  employment  contracts who are absent from work for at least one month and for not more than six months due to an employee\u00adfunded leave of absence ('sabbatical').\n\n## Scope 1 to Scope 3 carbon emissions\n\nThe carbon emissions generated by a company are recorded in various categories. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a part\u00ad nership between the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the  World  Business  Council  for  Sustainable  Development (WBCSD),  distinguishes  between  Scope 1,  Scope 2  and Scope 3 emissions, based on their various sources. Whereas\n\nScope 1 emissions are generated within a company through the combustion of fossil fuels, Scope 2 refers to the indirect emissions caused by the consumption of electricity and heat from externally generated sources of energy. Scope 3 emis\u00ad sions are generated in the upstream and downstream stag\u00ad es of the value chain, both in the supply chain (upstream) and in the subsequent use of products and services (down\u00ad stream).\n\nT\n\n## Temporary employee\n\nThe  number  of  people  employed  by  the  BMW Group  (in\u00ad cludes all of the consolidated and non\u00adconsolidated compa\u00ad nies in which the BMW Group holds more than 50 % of the shares)  whom  the  BMW Group  has  actively  hired  from  a temporary employment agency as temporary employees.\n\n## Temporary staff / working students\n\nThe number of people employed on an hourly basis as tem\u00ad porary staff at a BMW Group company (includes all of the consolidated and non\u00adconsolidated companies in which the BMW Group holds more than 50 % of the shares) while stud\u00ad ying for a degree.\n\n## Training and further education\n\nExpenditure for training comprises all costs incurred in the year under  report  for  vocational  training  within  the BMW Group in a total of seven countries, including personnel costs for trainers and apprentices as well as other costs and investments related to vocational training.\n\nGlossary and Explanation of Key Figures\n\nThe number of apprentices undergoing training within the BMW Group includes those employed at domestic and inter\u00ad national plants in a total of seven countries as well as those working in corporate functions, at Group plants in Germany and international sales companies as well as in the Financial Services segment.\n\nExpenditure for further education includes all costs incurred by the BMW Group's consolidated companies in connection with ongoing and advanced training. This includes prepara\u00ad tion and implementation costs, opportunity costs and in\u00ad vestments made in order to provide such training. Costs also include notional depreciation, measured on the basis of as\u00ad set inventory lists.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nV\n\n## Value at risk\n\nA measure of the potential maximum loss in value of an item during a set time period, based on a specified probability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Working hours / working times\n\nContractually stipulated weekly hours of work.",
