We want to give our customers confidence that their food and everyday needs are delivered to them ethically and sustainably truly creating better experiences together for a better tomorrow.\n\nWe are determined to build on the foundations of our 2020 Sustainability Strategy to deliver an even more ambitious sustainability agenda. In November 2020, we released our Sustainability Plan 2025: Working together to create a better tomorrow our new program of positive change for our people, our planet and our product.\n\nWhile we have set our sights on long-term horizons, including goals for 2030 (scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) and 2050 (net positive emissions), we will deliver meaningful change year on year. In F22 we will make progress on areas such as green electricity, retail careers in the workplace of the future and regenerative agricultural practices to minimise our impact on the environment.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nRecognising that addressing climate change is of critical importance to our business and economies globally, Woolworths Group has set ambitious emissions reduction goals aligned to the Paris Agreement, to limit temperature change to 1.5 degrees. By 2030 we will deliver:\n\n- \u00b7  63% reduction from own operations (scope 1 & 2), and\n- \u00b7  19% reduction across our supply chain (scope 3).\n\nOur targets have been endorsed by the global Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nThe Group's F21 scope 1 and 2 emissions were 27% below 2015 levels. Initiatives contributing to this reduction include refrigeration management, solar rollout, and our Energy Management Centre which continues to proactively manage our energy use.\n\nElectricity use is the largest contributor to our greenhouse gas emissions. Woolworths Group uses around 1% of Australia's electricity, so our commitment to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025 represents",

In June, we announced our first renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) which will inject enough green electricity into the state's energy grid to power 30% of Woolworths Group's NSW energy needs.\n\n## Sustainability Governance\n\nWoolworths Group considers sustainability to be a board-level strategic issue. The CEO and Group Executive Committee, including the Chief Sustainability O/fficer, have accountability for the implementation of our sustainability strategy.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are identified through the Woolworths Group Risk Management Process in line with our Risk Management Framework (RMF) framework. The RMF framework sets out the required end-to-end management of our risk assessment and risk response processes, and monitoring and reporting. Climate change has been identified as a material business risk and is included in the material risk section of the Annual Report on page 36. Our response to these risks is contained in our Sustainability Plan 2025.\n\nFor more information see 2021 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Human Rights & Responsible Sourcing\n\nAs Australia's largest retailer, with complex operations and supply chains, Woolworths Group is exposed to dynamic human rights risks. Stakeholders continue to identify human rights as one of our material risks. The human rights commitments in the Sustainability Plan 2025 articulate our ambition to build a rights-respecting culture where human rights risks are identified, managed and mitigated in our operations and supply chain. Progress highlights against this important initiative can be found on the left bar on page 4.\n\nAs outlined in our second Modern Slavery Statement we continue to scale up our human rights due diligence in non-trade and operations, while maintaining focus on commodities and countries with higher modern slavery risks to improve outcomes for workers. Human rights due diligence is an ongoing process of bringing the concerns of potentially a/ffected stakeholders into consideration for decision making.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommunity contribution as % of EBT on a 2-year rolling average\n\n1.23 %\n\nCarbon emissions reduction\n\n27 %\n\nbelow 2015 levels\n\nF21 Plastics reduction\n\n> 2,500 t\n\n## Human rights key highlights in F21\n\n- \u00b7  Conducted a risk analysis of labour and service providers in our operations and strengthened key controls\n- \u00b7  Developed bespoke due diligence strategies for higher risk commodities, including seafood and cotton\n- \u00b7  Oversaw the repayment of $361,851 to 24 workers in the cleaning and trolley collector sector\n- \u00b7  Supported our teams to manage modern slavery risks with the launch of three new resources\n- - A toolkit for addressing modern slavery in our supply chains and operations\n- - A guide to drafting and negotiating modern slavery contract clauses\n- - Human rights due diligence maturity framework\n\n3\n\nDIRE\n\nCT\n\nREPOR\n\nT\n\nORS'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Both businesses continued to work on the separation as well as establishing the partnership agreements to support the ongoing relationship between the groups.\n\nWork on the separation formally recommenced in February 2021. A strong and experienced executive team and board was assembled to take the business forward following the appointment of Steve Donohue as CEO and Peter Hearl as Chairman in 2019.\n\nFollowing formal approval at the General Meeting on 18 June, Endeavour Group was successfully separated on 28 June by way of a demerger, with eligible shareholders receiving one Endeavour Group share for every share held in Woolworths Group.\n\nThe demerger of Endeavour Group required an enormous combined e/ffort from team members across both businesses and we look forward to being better together in partnership with Endeavour Group for many years to come.\n\n## Better together in partnership\n\nThe creation of a win-win partnership was at the core of the rationale for the Endeavour Group separation. Post demerger, Woolworths Group and Endeavour Group will continue to work together to retain ongoing benefits, including the infrastructure built by Woolworths Group across its core competencies.\n\nThe key benefits under the partnership agreements include a framework that supports joint growth opportunities and further develops capabilities for mutual benefit; enables both groups to maintain the synergies and collaborative relationships, and supports Endeavour Group with continuity of its operations.\n\nThis is enabled by key agreements in place across:\n\n- \u00b7 Supply Chain & Stores\n- \u00b7 Loyalty & Fintech\n- \u00b7 Digital & Media\n- \u00b7 Business Support\n- \u00b7 International\n\nThe partnership agreements between Woolworths Group and Endeavour Group also extend choice for customers to meet their everyday needs through its businesses and partners.\n\nSteve Donohue, Endeavour Group CEO and Brad Banducci, Woolworths Group CEO and Managing Director.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the last eight years Woolworths Group and Quantium have partnered to better understand our customers through the responsible use of data.\n\nQuantium will become a key part of Woolworths Group, while retaining its senior leadership team and continuing to operate in sectors outside of retail.\n\nIn addition to the strategic partnership, new business Q-Retail was created to bring together the best data science and advanced analytics and retail capabilities from across Quantium and Woolworths Group. Specifically, Q-Retail will focus on delivering Woolworths Group's Advanced Analytics Plan and commercialising retail products globally.\n\nCombined with the Group's strategic focus on connected and seamless customer experiences, advanced analytics will be key to improving ranges and services as well as support provided to team members and supplier partners. As the retail industry continues to rapidly change, Woolworths Group recognises that the way in which data is gathered, interpreted and protected is becoming ever more important.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building strong adjacencies\n\n## AUGUST 2020\n\nAnnounced a strategic investment in PFD Food Services as a logical adjacency for Woolworths Group to further support its growing food and everyday needs ecosystem.\n\n## SEPTEMBER 2020\n\nLaunched Woolworths at Work, a procurement solution that supports businesses with a streamlined shopping experience and dedicated support, transforming how they manage spending and budget.\n\n## FEBRUARY 2021\n\nAnnounced the formation of a stand-alone business, Greenstock, to support the Group's growth and deliver on the combined red meat needs of partners across retail, international and wholesale.\n\n## APRIL 2021\n\nAnnounced an increase in holding in Quantium from 47% to 75%, as Quantium becomes a key part of Woolworths Group, while retaining its senior leadership team and continuing to operate in sectors outside of retail.\n\n## APRIL 2021\n\nWoolworths Group's venture capital arm W23 announced an investment in Australian startup Marketplacer whose platform is used by a number of global retailers exploring third-party marketplace strategies.

It has become clear that\n\nvaccination is key and Woolworths Group remains committed to playing its part in supporting vaccination e/fforts across the broader community.\n\nIn addition, a number of initiatives have been rolled out to stores and distribution centres to help protect customers and teams. This includes enabling Government QR code check-in for all states and territories, in-store Health Ambassadors, promotion of the Sonder app to support team member mental wellbeing as well as face shields and additional cleaning procedures across stores in high-risk areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Next generation supply chain\n\nWoolworths Group's supply chain arm, Primary Connect, commenced building works  in May this year on its new national distribution centre (NDC) in the Moorebank Logistics Park in Western Sydney. Set to open in 2024, the Moorebank NDC will service more than 1,000 Woolworths Supermarkets across Australia. The site will be co-located with the Moorebank Regional Distribution Centre, which will start construction later and open in 2025. With cutting-edge automation and 75,000 square metre of floor space across both sites, Moorebank will enable Woolworths to o/ffer its customers an expanded range and improved stock availability in-store.\n\nThe construction of a new temperature-controlled 76,000 square metre facility was also announced in June. The new facility will be built at Wetherill Park, Sydney and will service over 280 stores in NSW and replace the current fragmented temperature-controlled network. With completion expected in F24, the new facility will result in fresher products for customers, allow for ongoing range expansion and also deliver material transport and operating e/fficiency benefits from F25 onwards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COVIDSafe\n\n## Vaccination clinics\n\nEstablished pop-up vaccination clinics at key food-related DCs in NSW and Victoria with assistance from Federal and State governments\n\n## Paid leave for vaccinations\n\nProvided up to eight hours of paid leave for full-time and part-time team members to receive vaccinations\n\n## QR check-in\n\nEnabled Government QR code check-in at our stores and support sites nationwide\n\n## Testing and health screening\n\nEstablished five testing facilities across Sydney DCs and CFCs.

Our team also continues to operate with vigilance, great care and resilience as we manage the ongoing impacts of COVID.\n\nSince the escalation of the Delta outbreak in Australia, I again am humbled and proud of our team and their dedication to do what is right. As part of our ambition for a better tomorrow we also recognise the role we play in creating a safe place for our team as well as our customers. This purpose has guided our response in supporting vaccination e/fforts where possible to protect our wider communities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Delivering for our shareholders\n\nOur busy agenda in F21 included the successful completion of a key milestone at the end of F21 with the demerger of Endeavour Group. We are confident that it will create value for shareholders with each business now able to focus on their core customer o/ffering and new growth opportunities while continuing to benefit from a strong partnership.\n\nWe also completed a number of investments to support our continued growth. This included our increased investment in Quantium and the completion of our strategic investment in PFD Food Services, a logical adjacency for the Group and our growing ecosystem.\n\nWoolworths Group has declared a final dividend of 55 cents per share bringing the full year dividend to 108 cents per share. Together with the H2 dividend that Endeavour Group is expected to pay, the combined dividend is broadly in line with the improvement in Woolworths Group NPAT before significant items of 22.9%.\n\nIt is also pleasing to announce the return of $2 billion to shareholders by way of an o/ff-market buy-back. Together with the final dividend, this is expected to return $1.1 billion of franking credits to shareholders. The ability to return this capital to our shareholders reflects the strength of our business and our solid balance sheet position which also provides su/fficient capital to continue to invest in growth opportunities.\n\n## Doing the right thing\n\nWe have made pleasing progress on our sustainability agenda in F21; however, we recognise there is still much to do to continue to have a positive impact on our wider communities.\n\nAcross our pillars of People, Planet and Product there have been a number of achievements, including the recognition for our work to improve diversity and inclusion, the signing of our first renewable power purchase agreement, and initiatives to make being healthier easier for our customers with the launch of initiatives such as the online platform HealthyLife.\n\nWe also recognised that we need to do more to listen and learn when it comes to our commitment to reconciliation. In April of this year the Group made the decision it would not proceed with the proposed Dan Murphy's store in Darwin following an independent review of the development which was commissioned by the Group in December. The report highlighted where we failed to meet our aspirations and standards in our purpose and values, and in doing so, has emboldened us to take meaningful steps forward which are consistent with our purpose and commitment to reconciliation.\n\nTo reflect our commitment to our purpose and values, we have updated our remuneration incentives from F22 to include the Group's reputation, which will be externally and independently measured. We considered this to be an important step to align our internal practices on meeting customers and community expectations in order to operate as a responsible corporate citizen.\n\nDuring the year, we made key executive appointments to provide more focus and structure for our commitment to always do the right thing. David Walker was appointed Chief Risk O/fficer and Alex Holt was appointed Chief Sustainability O/fficer to reflect the increasing focus in each area.\n\nLate last year my fellow directors and I were pleased to welcome Maxine Brenner to the Woolworths Group Board following the retirement of long-standing board member, Jillian Broadbent. I have no doubt that Maxine's skills and experience will add tremendous value as Chair of the Risk Committee and to the Woolworths Group Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nI would also like to personally extend my thanks to our team, especially those at the frontline of our operations as they continue to make sure customers have access to their essential needs.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the uncertain operating environment ahead, I am excited about the next era for Woolworths Group. By focusing on our core businesses, investing in our supply chain, leveraging our strong partnerships and continuing to be guided by our purpose and values, we will continue to create value for all stakeholders while striving for a better tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGordon Cairns CHAIRMAN\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "We have also made good progress during the year building out the Group's ecosystem through a series of strategic partnerships, investments and new businesses. In June, we completed our strategic investment in PFD Food Services to expand our food o/ffering into new markets. We know how important leveraging data and analytics is in the retail industry of the future, so we've increased our ownership of Quantium and created a partnership called Q-Retail to accelerate our advanced analytics capabilities. We've also established a number of new businesses, including Greenstock, Wpay and HealthyLife to provide greater value to our customers and meet their changing needs.\n\nWe are also continuing to invest in our supply chain transformation which will deliver the capacity and capability needed to support future growth. In F21 we opened Melbourne Fresh DC, as well as commenced work on the Moorebank NDC. This multi-year transformation will enable expanded range and better availability for our customers, as well as ensuring faster, fresher and more e/fficient deliveries to our stores and through our supply chain.\n\n## Business performance\n\nThe Group's trading performance in F21 was strong with sales growth of 5.7% and Group EBIT 1 increasing by 13.7%.\n\nIn Australian Food, H1 saw strong sales growth as a result of our successful Disney+ Ooshies and glass container campaigns and elevated demand due to lockdowns, whereas H2 sales were impacted by cycling COVID in the final four months of the year. Full year Australian Food sales increased by 5.4%, with EBIT 1 increasing by 9.0%.\n\nOur WooliesX digital and eCommerce business had another year of exceptional growth, with eCommerce sales increasing by 74.7% compared to the prior year. To meet customer demand, we continued to scale up our convenience propositions with an expanded range of Home Delivery and Pick up options.\n\nIn New Zealand Food, sales growth in H1 was impacted by low market growth, particularly during the summer tourist\n\nseason. In H2, sales declined 5.5% as the business cycled New Zealand's restrictive lockdown period. EBIT for the year declined by 4.6% reflecting lower sales.\n\nBIG W's momentum continued with another strong year of improved customer scores, strong sales growth of 11.6% and EBIT increasing over 300% in the year to $172 million. H2 sales growth moderated as expected but remained positive with an increased focus on digital and eCommerce and providing customers with safe and convenient shopping options.\n\n## Working towards a better tomorrow\n\nRight from the start of COVID, we have prioritised being COVIDSafe and this has continued in F21. We've partnered with the Federal Government and other food retailers, to establish pop-up vaccination clinics at our food-related distribution centres, as well as increasing access to vaccines for our store teams, who are critical to ensure a stable supply of food and everyday needs for our customers. No team member should have to choose between their health and their pay, particularly as we know vaccination will make shopping safer for our teams and customers, and we have revised our vaccination leave policy to reflect this.\n\nOperating sustainably is not only important to our customers, but it's increasingly intrinsic to our business and the way we operate. Setting ambitious and measurable sustainability goals as part of our Sustainability Plan 2025 launched in November last year will help us to play our part in making the world a better place for a better tomorrow.\n\nOur people are the core of our business and we're continuing to focus on our holistic diversity and inclusion agenda, with more work to be done in F22. I'm proud that our strong diversity has been recognised and celebrated through a number of external awards, including the WGEA Employer of Choice for gender equality citation and AWEI gold tier status for LGBTQ+ inclusion for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nWe acknowledge the environmental impact of our business and we continue to focus on reducing our footprint with the installation of solar panels in over 190 Woolworths Group sites. We also signed our first power purchase agreement in NSW in F21 as we transition to 100% renewable energy by 2025. We're also making good progress on both eliminating food waste and reducing plastic across our products.\n\nWe remain committed to resolving the salaried team underpayments announced in 2019. To date, more than $350 million has been paid to current and former salaried team members. During the year, we launched a program to enhance our pay process integrity and to help ensure it doesn't happen again.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group costs in F20 have been restated to exclude $7 million related to Endeavour Group. F21 Group costs included COVID-related costs of $28 million, the cost of additional risk and payroll remediation resources, and higher insurance costs. For F22, Group costs will include Woolworths Group's equity accounted contribution from its 14.6% investment in Endeavour Group. Excluding this contribution, Group costs in F22 are expected to be approximately $175 million.",

To aid comparability, all balance sheet commentary provided compares the F21 normalised closing balance sheet to F20.\n\nClosing inventory of $4,345 million decreased by $89 million compared to F20, mainly due to normalised inventory levels in the Food businesses following an inventory build in F20. This was partially o/ffset by a rebuild of inventory in BIG W. Closing inventory days were 2.3 days lower and average inventory days from continuing operations declined by 0.5 days on the prior year reflecting strong sales momentum in F21.\n\nTrade payables of $5,721 million decreased by $122 million compared to F20, primarily due to decreased volume replenishments of COVID contingency stock compared to the prior year, particularly in Q4 together with shorter payment terms for smaller suppliers.\n\nA demerger distribution liability of $7,870 million reflects the fair value of the demerger distribution payable to shareholders following the approval\n\nof the demerger resolutions for Endeavour Group in June 2021.\n\n## Fixed assets, investments, loans provided\n\nto related parties and convertible notes of $9,581 million increased by $628 million mainly due to additions reflecting investment in new stores, property development, refurbishments of existing stores, investment in eCommerce and digital, IT infrastructure and acquisitions of businesses.\n\nLease assets of $12,670 million increased by $608 million primarily driven by lease remeasurements of $1,253 million and lease additions of $537 million, partially o/ffset by lease depreciation of $1,228 million.\n\nTotal funds employed decreased $6,014 million, largely driven by the $7,870 million demerger distribution payable to shareholders as a result of the Endeavour Group demerger, partially o/ffset by a $799 million increase in intangible assets due to the acquisition of Quantium and software additions.\n\nLease liabilities of $15,445 million increased by $717 million, primarily driven by commencement of new leases of $556 million, remeasurements\n\nduring the period of $1,242 million and interest of $687 million, partially o/ffset by $1,845 million of payments made in the period.\n\nNet assets of $1,739 million includes a $390 million put option liability over the non-controlling interest in Quantium. The liability reflects the amount expected to be paid at the exercise of the put option.\n\nGroup ROFE was 15.1%, 143 bps higher than F20. ROFE increased for all businesses reflecting EBIT growth well above increases in funds employed other than New Zealand Food. Closing funds employed used for the Group ROFE calculation has been adjusted to remove the impact of the demerger distribution liability which has resulted in a temporary reduction in funds employed at year end.\n\nShareholders' equity of $1,379 million decreased by $7,363 million mainly due to the recognition of the demerger distribution liability of $7,870 million recognised in reserves and share capital. As discussed below, this timing impact will reverse in F22 and shareholders' equity will increase when the gain on the demerger of Endeavour Group of approximately $6.4 billion is recognised in Q1 F22.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The increase in Group EBITDA of $1,244 million was largely o/ffset by outflows from working capital and non-cash movements compared to inflows in the prior year. The increase in EBITDA reflects higher trading EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations as well as a gain on significant items in F21 compared to a loss on significant items in F20.\n\n## Increase in trade payables was\n\nunusually high in F20 due to creditor payment timing and high trade payables due to increased COVID-related stock replenishments. In F21, movement\n\nin payables was lower due to lower Q4 inventory replenishments, and inventory optimisation initiatives.\n\nIn F21, decrease in provisions of $183 million was due to ongoing progress and cash payments for salaried team member remediation resulting in a lower provision balance compared to the prior year.\n\n## Net interest paid (non-leases)\n\ndecreased by 26.9% reflecting lower net debt during the year and lower borrowing costs.\n\nTax paid increased 13.5% due to higher tax instalments on higher profits in F21 and stamp duty payable on the Endeavour Group demerger.\n\n## Cash used in investing activities was\n\n$2,200 million, an increase of $255 million or 13.1% above the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the Group acquiring a controlling interest in Quantium for $169 million (net of cash acquired), and increased investment in eCommerce, IT and digital projects, partially o/ffset by higher proceeds on property sales.\n\n## Repayment of lease liabilities\n\nincreased by 8.7% reflecting lease additions and lease remeasurements.\n\nThe Group cash realisation ratio was 97.4% (F20: 124.4%), primarily due to the cash payment of salaried team member remediation.",

        "page_content": "## Capital management\n\n## Capital management objectives\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure with the objective of enhancing long-term shareholder value through funding its business at an optimised weighted average cost of capital. The Group returns capital to shareholders when consistent with its long-term capital structure objectives and will enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe Group remains committed to solid investment grade credit ratings and several actions can be undertaken, if required, to support the credit profile. This includes the sale of non-core assets, further working capital initiatives, and adjusting growth capital expenditure and the property leasing profile. The Group's credit ratings 1 are BBB (stable outlook) from S&P and Baa2 (stable outlook) from Moody's.\n\n## Financing events during 2021\n\nIn September 2020, the $654 million US Senior Notes matured. In November 2020, the $229 million European Medium Term Notes also matured. The Group refinanced these maturities with a $1 billion domestic Medium Term Note issuance in May 2020.\n\nIn December 2020, the Group entered into a $384 million bank guarantee facility and into $398\n\nmillion direct surety bond facilities to support the Group's workers' compensation obligations as a self-insurer. These transactions refinanced the Group's $500 million bank guarantee facility, which matured in January 2021.\n\nIn April 2021, the $424 million US Senior Notes were repaid with existing surplus cash and bank facilities.\n\n## Upcoming maturities and transactions\n\nSubject to market conditions, the Group is intending to launch a debt capital markets transaction (total value approximately $1.5 billion) where the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the long-term funding of the Group's increased investment in Quantium, the acquisition of PFD, and represents an opportunity to secure long-term, low-cost debt and reduce the Group's overall cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital.\n\n## O/ff-market buy-back\n\nOn 26 August 2021, the Group announced a capital return of $2 billion to shareholders by way of an o/ff-market buy-back. The buy-back is expected to return approximately $840 million of franking credits to shareholders. For more information, please visit www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/buyback\n\n- 1 These credit ratings have been issued by a credit rating agency which holds an Australian Financial Services Licence with an authorisation to issue credit ratings to wholesale clients only and are for the benefit of the Group's debt providers.\n\n## Non-IFRS Financial Information\n\nThe 2021 Annual Report for the 52 weeks ended 27 June 2021 contains certain non-IFRS financial measures of historical financial performance, balance sheet or cash flows. Non-IFRS financial measures are financial measures other than those defined or specified under all relevant accounting standards and may not be directly comparable with other companies' measures but are common practice in the industry in which Woolworths Group operates. Non-IFRS financial information should be considered in addition to, and is not intended to be a substitute for, or more important than, IFRS measures. The presentation of non-IFRS measures is in line with Regulatory Guide 230 issued by the Australian Security and Investments Commission in December 2011 to promote full and clear disclosure for investors and other users of financial information and minimise the possibility of being misled by such information.\n\nThese measures are used by management and the directors as the primary measures of assessing the financial performance of the Group and individual segments. The directors also believe that these non-IFRS measures assist in providing additional meaningful information on the underlying drivers of the business, performance and trends, as well as the financial position of the Woolworths Group. Non-IFRS financial measures are also used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods (such as comparable sales), by adjusting for non-recurring or uncontrollable factors which a/ffect IFRS measures, to aid the user in understanding the Woolworths Group's performance. Consequently, non-IFRS measures are used by the directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes and have remained consistent with the prior year. Non-IFRS measures are not subject to audit or review.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Q4, total sales increased 1.2% and comparable sales increased by 0.1%, with cycling of prior year pantry-loading partly o/ffset by elevated sales in May and June following COVID outbreaks in Victoria and NSW and a strong trade plan throughout the year. Own and Exclusive Brands sales increased 5.8% in F21 supported by new products developed by Woolworths FoodCo and launched during the year. The Cook, BBQ and Crumbed ranges continue to resonate well with customers.\n\nMetro Food Stores F21 sales declined 4.9% to $897 million, impacted by reduced foot tra/ffic across CBD and transit locations, with comparable sales declining approximately 45% and 30%, respectively.

Inflation in Meat was driven by increased livestock costs.\n\nGross margin (%) increased 21 bps to 29.4% with stock loss improvements through higher sales velocity and successful stock loss initiatives, as well as product mix being favourably impacted by COVID.

COVID costs in the year remained material at $205 million (excluding discretionary team discount and bonus payments) but moderated as the year progressed until an increase in June due to COVID outbreaks.\n\nHigher cash CODB reflects incremental store wages associated with higher eCommerce penetration, investment in IT platforms, developing new digital capabilities to optimise the customer experience, incremental supply chain costs including Melbourne Fresh Distribution Centre transition costs, and investment in new businesses. Inflation was broadly o/ffset by productivity benefits.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation increased by 6.7% driven by investment in new stores, Renewals, supply chain and shorter-life technology and digital assets.\n\nF21 EBIT before significant items increased by 9.0% to $2.4 billion, with H1 growth of 13.0% and H2 growth of 4.5%.

This was partially o/ffset by lower net working capital. Despite higher average funds employed, ROFE increased by 86 bps due to the strong increase in EBIT.\n\nDuring the year, we amplified our focus on supporting our communities through living our core value of 'We Care Deeply'. Together with customers, we provided more than $8 million in support to OzHarvest, Foodbank and Fareshare with 10,000 tonnes of edible surplus food provided to charities.

The new store will operate with 15% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the average Woolworths supermarket in Qld, which is equivalent to taking 290 cars o/ff the road each year.

In addition, we launched our first automated eStore at Carrum Downs and shared plans for our first automated customer fulfilment centre set to open in Auburn in 2024, which will ensure continued convenient service growth. At the same time, NPS continued to improve with improvements to availability and the\n\nlaunch of new features, like 'Quick Reorder' and 'Have You Forgotten', delivering an even more personalised, seamless experience for customers and making online shopping easier. As customers increasingly shop eCommerce on the go, the Woolworths App has grown in popularity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EVERYDAY REWARDS\n\nEveryday Rewards has rebranded and expanded to deliver an even better customer experience. Membership has grown by almost one million and the program now has more than 13 million members, many of whom are connecting with us in the Everyday Rewards app and millions who are boosting personalised o/ffers regularly. The app celebrated its first birthday and weekly active users continue to grow, creating even more opportunities to connect with customers multiple times across the week. Our first ever Everyday Rewards branded collectable campaign launched in F21, with 1.6 million members participating, and new partnerships were established with Bupa, Origin, Pet Culture and SuperPharmacy, further expanding the value Everyday Rewards o/ffers members. Everyday Rewards members were also given the opportunity to choose eReceipts when they shop in-store at Woolworths, BIG W and BWS. Opting out of paper receipts is not only convenient for customers but also another small step towards our commitment to reduce waste as we strive toward a better tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WooliesX wins 2021 Mozo People's Choice Awards\n\nWooliesX eCom services recognised as the highest rated online supermarket, winning all seven awards in the category.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Some softening took place in Q4 with Out of Stocks, which was impacted by a combination of global supply challenges and shipping delays and stronger sales than anticipated.\n\nTotal sales for F21 declined 0.6% to $7.1 billion, cycling the strict COVID lockdowns in H2 F20. Sales in H2 decreased 5.5% after cycling growth of 13.8% in the prior year. Q4 sales declined 3.9% and comparable sales declined 4.2%; average two-year comparable growth in Q4 rose to 4.9%.\n\nDigital and eCommerce momentum was again a highlight for the year. eCommerce sales grew 30.2%, despite cycling elevated sales from COVID impacts in H2, with Q4 penetration at 12.5%. Additional capacity was added with two new eStores in Grenada North (Lower North Island) and Moorhouse (Christchurch); the first two automated fulfilment units were launched in partnership with Takeo/ff Technologies at the Auckland Penrose eStore in January and at Moorhouse in March. Other digital highlights include the launch and scale-up of the Countdown transactional app and Delivery Saver subscription service. Further innovations included two Cleveron locker units for Pick up and the roll out of Scan&Go to six stores.\n\n| NZD $ MILLION                         | F21  (52 WEEKS)   | F20  (52 WEEKS)   | CHANGE   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Sales                                 | 7,146             | 7,192             | (0.6)%   |\n| EBITDA                                | 633               | 634               | (0.2)%   |\n| Depreciation and amortisation         | (272)             | (256)             | 6.3%     |\n| EBIT                                  | 361               | 378               | (4.6)%   |\n| Gross margin (%)                      | 25.3              | 25.0              | 24 bps   |\n| CODB (%)                              | 20.2              | 19.8              | 45 bps   |\n| EBIT to sales (%)                     | 5.0               | 5.3               | (21) bps |\n| Sales per square metre ($)            | 17,147            | 17,832            | (3.8)%   |\n| Funds employed                        | 4,329             | 4,190             | 3.3%     |\n| ROFE (%)                              | 8.4               | 8.8               | (40) bps |\n| Plastic removed (tonnes)  2           | 16.4              | -                 | n.m.     |\n| Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions (tonnes) | 61,802            | 68,426            | (9.7)%   |\n\n- 1 Growth for New Zealand Food quoted in New Zealand Dollars.\n- 2 Annualised calculated values for each reporting period based on virgin plastic weight removed per unit times annualised volumes.",

Two replacement Countdown stores and 10 Renewals were also completed. Sales per square metre declined by 3.8% to $17,147 due to the reduction in sales and an increase in average space.\n\nThe new Hilton meat plant went live in July 2021 supplying cabinet ready meat to all North Island Countdown stores. Progress was made on the new Palmerston North ambient and Auckland Fresh distribution centres which are scheduled for opening in September 2021 and May 2022, respectively.\n\nNew Zealand Food's franchise stores (Fresh Choice and Super Value) had strong two-year sales growth despite the impact from lack of international tourists, particularly over the summer period. One new Super Value store opened in December.\n\nAverage prices decreased by 0.5% in Q4 primarily driven by deflation in Grocery, Perishables and Meat, which was partly o/ffset by some inflation in Produce. The reduction in average prices moderated relative to Q3 which experienced a more significant COVID impact last year than Q4, with both quarters impacted by a reduction in promotions in H2 F20.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## eCommerce continued to gain momentum in F21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nF21 eCom\n\n30.2 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsales growth\n\nGross profit (%) increased 24 bps on last year, helped by continued progress in stock loss, mix improvements and increased use of data-driven tools in category management, such as the promotional e/ffectiveness tool. A new 'Value You Can Count On' campaign was launched to accompany over 4,000 products on the Great Price program.\n\nCODB (%) increased by 45 bps, with the biggest driver being team member wage increases driven by enterprise agreements. Other increases included store depreciation and digital spend arising from investment in the store network, eCommerce capacity and mix and digital capability, which have helped support eCommerce growth.\n\nEBIT for the year was $361 million, a 4.6% decline on the prior year following a 10.7% increase in EBIT in F20. H2 EBIT declined 13.3% due to cycling COVID.\n\nFollowing the launch of Countdown's 2025 Sustainability Commitments, progress has continued in F21, including no longer selling plastic cutlery from our stores as well as shifting our fresh pasta into PET from PVC, all hot smoked salmon to clear PET and the removals of all glitter products from our stores. We also explored new opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, including working with the Sustainable Business Council and other businesses and logistics operators to develop the Low Carbon Freight Pathway report to progressively decarbonise New Zealand's freight system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Richmond store Green Star accreditation\n\nIn late F21, Countdown delivered New Zealand's very first Green Star accredited supermarket. Countdown Richmond has been built with sustainability at the heart of both its construction and design and will be accredited in the coming months. The store is Countdown's first site with solar panels, which will deliver up to 10-15% of the energy needed to run the store. Other initiatives include doors on fridges to reduce energy use, a transcritical refrigeration system, digital shelf tickets to prevent paper going to landfill, water e/fficient fixtures and fittings and much more. Richmond is the first of many Green Star projects for Countdown as it works towards meeting its commitment that all new property developments will have a 4 star Green Star design and as-built rating, and a 5 star Green Star minimum standard by 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our businesses, both domestic and international, continue to face both opportunities and threats that could materially impact our operations.\n\nWoolworths Group is made up of a portfolio of some of Australia and New Zealand's most trusted retail brands and growth platforms. Wherever we operate, we are led by our Purpose, Core Values and Ways-of-Working to create better experiences together for a better tomorrow.\n\nOur food and everyday needs ecosystem is focused on delivering on the needs of our connected customers and leveraging our unique assets, brands and capabilities. To be confident we will achieve our purpose and execute our strategy, we need to manage risk (both internal and external) e/ffectively across the Group to protect the value of our assets today, but also to enable the Group to deliver growth for tomorrow.\n\nThe Group acknowledges that the COVID-19 pandemic is a contributory and/or causal factor to risks relating to, amongst others, lockdowns and trading impacts, customer and team member safety, mental health, economic conditions, consumer sentiment, and multiple operational and supply chain impacts. We are proud of our response to the pandemic and our ability to keep our team and customers safe while maintaining supply. However, we continue to be prepared for the rapidly evolving nature of the virus and emergence of new variants that make impacts di/fficult to predict and respond to.\n\nDespite this challenging environment, we successfully completed the separation of Endeavour Group as well as the formation of our retail, international and wholesale red meat business, Greenstock. Looking towards the future in this highly competitive and dynamic retail and online market, we also recognise the occurrence of continued market disruption and strategy execution risks.\n\nOur recently refreshed Risk Appetite Statement, as agreed with our Board, captures the types and amount of risk we are willing to accept in pursuit of value creation and guides how we manage and control risks.\n\nThe Board has demonstrated its commitment to Risk Management, with the formation of a new Risk Committee and the appointment of a Chief Risk O/fficer to the Woolworths Group Executive Committee, reporting to the CEO and Committee chair. Woolworths Group has commenced on a risk management journey to achieve a future objective where 'Woolworths Group is confident that we are operating e/ffectively to the Woolworths Group Risk Appetite'.\n\nOur material risks are considered and where appropriate, adjusted through regular meetings with senior management followed by review and oversight by the Board. We evaluate our risks in line with changes to our environment and may also identify additional and emerging risks that could adversely a/ffect the Group. Further information in relation to risk management can be found throughout the Annual Report and in the Corporate Governance Statement which is available on the Woolworths Group website. The material risks faced by Woolworths Group, that may impact on our ability to achieve our key strategic priorities, are outlined on pages 38-41.",

The Group is also subject to various state and local government food licensing requirements, and may be subject to environmental and town planning regulations incidental to the development of shopping centre sites. The Group has not incurred any significant liabilities under any environmental legislation.\n\n## Directors' and o/fficers' indemnity/insurance\n\n- (i)  The Constitution of the Company provides that the Company will indemnify to the maximum extent permitted by law any current or former director, secretary or other o/fficer of the Company or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company against:\n- (a)  any liability incurred by the person in that capacity;\n- (b) legal costs incurred in defending, or otherwise in connection with proceedings, whether civil, criminal or of an administrative or investigatory nature in which the person becomes involved because of that capacity; and\n- (c)  legal costs incurred in good faith in obtaining legal advice on issues relevant to the performance of their functions and discharge of their duties.\n- (ii)  Directors and o/fficers of Woolworths Group Limited and certain subsidiaries have entered into a Deed of Indemnity, Access and Insurance that provides for indemnity against liability as a director or o/fficer, except to the extent of indemnity under an insurance policy or where prohibited by statute. The Deed also entitles the director or o/fficer to access company documents and records, subject to undertakings as to confidentiality, and to receive directors' and o/fficers' insurance cover paid for by the Company.\n- (iii) During or since the end of the financial period, the Company has paid or agreed to pay a premium in respect of a contract of insurance insuring directors and o/fficers, and any persons who will insure these in the future, and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, against certain liabilities incurred in that capacity. Disclosure of the total amount of the premiums and the nature of the liabilities in respect of such insurance is prohibited by the contract of insurance.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nDuring the period, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Australia, the Company's auditor, has performed certain other services in addition to their statutory duties. The Board is satisfied that the provision of those non-audit services during the period by the auditor is compatible with, and did not compromise, the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) or as set out in Code of Conduct APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks or rewards.\n\nDetails of amounts paid or payable to the auditor for non-audit services provided during the year by the auditor are outlined in Note 6.3 to the financial statements.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe following information, contained in other sections of this Annual Report, forms part of this Directors' Report:\n\n- \u00b7 Operating and Financial Review details on pages 2 to 41 inclusive in the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Details of dividends, including the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) and shares issued as a result of the DRP, as outlined in Note 4.2 and Note 4.3 to the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Matters subsequent to the end of the financial period as outlined in Note 6.4 to the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Directors' interests in shares and performance rights as set out in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of the Remuneration Report.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\n## Dear Shareholder,\n\nAs Chair of the renamed People Committee (PC or the Committee), I am pleased to present the F21 Remuneration Report and look forward to engaging with shareholders as the Committee undertakes its work. May I acknowledge my predecessor in the role, Holly Kramer, for the work she and the Committee have done to create and govern the Woolworths Group people management policies and remuneration framework so that they remain fit for purpose, provide a strong link between pay and performance, and are aligned to best practice in the broader Australian market.\n\nThe uncertainties and challenges created by COVID-19 continued throughout F21 and our team has played an important part in supporting our communities in Australia and New Zealand through various lockdowns. During F21 we continued to make progress on our six strategic priorities, including accelerating the growth of our digital and eCommerce platforms and demerging Endeavour Group Limited. We acknowledge that the achievements of F21 have required extraordinary e/fforts from the Woolworths Group team.\n\n## F21 Reward outcomes: STI\n\nThe business plan for F21, and the entry, target and stretch measures the Board set, recognised the potential for significant uncertainty and an ongoing and uneven impact from COVID-19. Lockdowns of varying durations continued to drive high levels of in-home consumption, which, together with strong execution of our trade plans, resulted in elevated trading during parts of the year. Sales from continuing and discontinued operations were $67,278 million, representing growth of 5.6%, which was an outcome substantially above stretch. Similarly, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from continuing and discontinued operations before significant items of $3,663 million grew 13.7% to also exceed stretch. Trade Working Capital Days improved by 1.8 days, 1.5 days ahead of budget, which was also a stretch result. Voice of Customer (VOC) Net Promoter Score (NPS) results were positive overall through a highly volatile and challenging year, landing between entry and target. We achieved a strong improvement in reducing customer injuries in F21, with the Customer Claims measure exceeding stretch. Total Recordable Injuries and Hours Lost for team both failed to meet entry. While disappointed in this outcome, we also recognise that it has been significantly impacted by COVID-19.\n\nThe Board believes that the 115.5% scorecard result of between target and stretch and the resulting Short-Term Incentive (STI) outcome for F21 appropriately balances the impact of all these factors and reflects the team's strong performance throughout this volatile year.\n\n## F21 Reward outcomes: WISP\n\nAwards made under the F19-21 Woolworths Incentive Share Plan (WISP) achieved an outcome of between target and stretch, resulting in 77.5% of the maximum performance rights vesting. Sales per square metre (Sales/sqm) improved in each year of the plan period to achieve a result of $18,294 in F21 - driven in particular by strong sales growth in Australian Food and Endeavour Drinks - for an outcome close to stretch. Return\n\non funds employed (ROFE) increased by 150 bps over the plan period, resulting in an outcome between entry and target, with EBIT over the period increasing at a faster rate than funds employed. The Board is also pleased with the substantial value that the team delivered to our shareholders over this period, achieving a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 61%, ranking Woolworths at the 89 th percentile of our comparator group.\n\n## Management changes in F21\n\nWe continued to build management team strength during F21, developing our team, promoting diversity, and deepening our succession bench strength. Claire Peters, who was Managing Director of Woolworths Supermarkets for over three years until the end of September 2021, was appointed as Managing Director of B2B and Everyday Needs. After two years as Managing Director of Woolworths New Zealand, Natalie Davis returned to Australia in October 2021 and assumed the role of Managing Director of Woolworths Supermarkets.\n\n## Executive Remuneration Framework Review\n\nDuring F21 the Board reviewed the appropriateness of the executive remuneration framework, and identified two opportunities to strengthen alignment of the underlying performance measures with the Group's strategic objectives. From F22, the Safety metric in the STI scorecard will evolve to a new broader measure - Severity Rate - which includes all team and customer injuries or illnesses (first aid through to lost time injuries, both physical and psychological) and events with potential for high severity. We will also introduce a Reputation measure in our Long-Term Incentive (LTI), replacing the Sales/sqm measure, which will operate alongside our financial performance measures of Relative TSR and ROFE. The Board believes that reputation is a key measure of the Group's ability to deliver its strategy and be at our best for our customers, team, and communities. Sales/sqm will remain an important metric used by the Group, but has become less important as a Group performance measure given the move towards an ecosystem business.\n\n## In summary\n\nF21 was a year when the Group's values came to life, with our team putting the needs and safety of our customers and communities first. The Group made progress on our strategy despite the disruption caused by COVID-19, and has taken further steps to build its food and everyday needs retail ecosystem with the announced investment in PFD (completed in F22), further investment in Quantium, and the launch of Healthy Life and PetCulture. Through the Endeavour Group demerger, the Board and management have focused on a smooth transition of remuneration arrangements so that executives remain aligned with delivery of the strategy and growth of shareholder value in both organisations. We look forward to ongoing dialogue with, and the support of, our shareholders in F22 as we deliver shareholder value and create better experiences together for a better tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSiobhan McKenna\n\nChair - People Committee",

        "page_content": "## 2 EXECUTIVE KMP REMUNERATION\n\n## 2.1 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE\n\n## Our approach and rationale: F21 Short-Term Incentive\n\nWe believe that alignment of our STI arrangements from the CEO through to our store teams is a key symbol of our Customer 1 st Team 1 st Brand and Culture approach to transforming our business. Individual STI outcomes reflect business performance against the STI scorecard and individual contribution to these results, including our Ways-of-Working and Core Values. The Board also reviews executive behaviour and any malus policy considerations when determining STI outcomes for Executive KMP. All measures and targets are reviewed annually so that STI drives the right outcomes each year. Intended changes for the F22 plan are set out in section 2.5.\n\n## Assessing business performance:\n\nThe STI balanced scorecard includes a mix of metrics, with 60% weighting on financial metrics and 40% weighting on non-financial metrics. Five equally weighted business scorecard measures drive outcomes for shareholders, customers and our team:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customer Satisfaction\n\nOur strategy is underpinned by great customer experiences and success is dependent on us delivering convenient ways to shop and competitive prices for our customers so they continue to choose us over our competitors. Our online platforms are key to delivering new and improved ways customers can shop with us. Customer feedback measures include Net Promoter Score (NPS) to better measure progress against our ambition to deliver better shopping experiences. We use Voice of Customer (VOC) and NPS methodology weighted 30% to our eCommerce customers and 70% to our in-store customers to measure overall customer satisfaction.\n\n## Safety\n\nWe are a people business and the safety of our team and customers is of great importance. Safety performance is measured using three equally weighted measures, which includes improvement in: (i) customer claims; (ii) total recordable (team member) injuries; and (iii) hours lost. We measure the number of injuries as opposed to frequency rates so that our measures are easier to understand and communicate. Hours lost are included in the overall safety performance to help us understand both the frequency and severity of injuries.\n\n## Sales, EBIT and Working Capital Days\n\nIt is critical for the sustainability of our business to constantly work towards improving all elements of our financial performance, including the productivity of store selling space, the e/fficiency of our stores, supply chain and overall management of costs and the e/ffective management of inventory and working capital. Sales, EBIT and Working Capital performance are all key financial performance metrics used to measure the creation of value for our shareholders.\n\n## Assessing individual performance:\n\nTwo equally weighted categories of goals are used to review performance:\n\n- \u00b7 Business strategy and performance goals that capture how individuals contribute to the performance of the business during the year, and their contribution to initiatives that will transform our business for the future.\n- \u00b7 Ways-of-Working and people goals that capture how business strategy and performance goals have been delivered, and how leaders set their teams up for success.\n\nThe Board also has discretion to adjust the vesting of Deferred STI (DSTI) for individuals, which may be reduced (including to zero) for cases of behaviour inconsistent with our Ways-of-Working or Core Values (see malus policy on page 68). These would be the most serious of cases that would not have been adequately dealt with through normal performance management or consequence frameworks.\n\n## Delivering STI outcomes:\n\nDepending on business and individual performance:\n\n- \u00b7 Zero for below entry performance.\n- \u00b7 50% of STI target for entry performance.\n- \u00b7 100% of STI target for target performance.\n- \u00b7 150% of STI target for stretch performance.\n\nThis gives the Board su/fficient opportunity to vary STI outcomes so they reflect di/ffering levels of performance. The Board also has discretion to vary STI awards due to factors that are beyond these performance measures so that rewards appropriately reflect complete performance.\n\nGroup Executive STI awards are delivered:\n\n- \u00b7 50% as cash; and\n- \u00b7 50% deferred in share rights for two years.\n\nThe 50% deferred component supports increased share ownership, facilitates retention, and is a risk management lever to facilitate malus policy application during the deferral period.\n\n1\n\nPERF\n\nHIGHLIGHT\n\nS\n\nORMANCE\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Growth was impacted both by elevated in-home consumption in response to COVID-19 restrictions for our Food and Drinks businesses, despite cycling the significant growth of H2 F20, and strong trading performance.

The following information applies to awards made under the F19, F20 and F21 plans. Intended changes for the F22 plan are set out in section 2.5.\n\n## Assessing business performance:\n\nThe LTI rewards executives subject to performance against three equally weighted measures over a three-year performance period:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Relative TSR (rTSR)\n\nRelative TSR is used as a measure in our LTI plan to align executive outcomes and long-term shareholder value creation. The peer group is the ASX30, excluding metals and mining companies. 50% vesting is achieved ranking at the median. 100% vesting is achieved when our peer group ranking is at the 75 th percentile or higher. Between the median and the 75 th percentile, pro-rata vesting is achieved from 50% to 100%. Peer group ranking below the median results in zero vesting.\n\n## Sales per square metre (Sales/sqm)\n\nSales/sqm measures sales productivity improvements across the Food and Drinks businesses. E/fficient use of our physical network for in-store and online sales is important to our success.\n\n## Return on Funds Employed (ROFE)\n\nROFE is an important measure to drive behaviours consistent with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. ROFE improvements can be delivered through earnings growth as well as the disciplined allocation of capital, management of assets, and working capital which is important for a business that is building capabilities for the future. ROFE is defined as EBIT (from continuing and discontinued operations) before significant items for the previous 12 months as a percentage of average (opening, mid and closing) funds employed, including significant item provisions.\n\nThe Sales/sqm and ROFE targets are published following the end of the performance period given the commercial sensitivity of this information.\n\nThe vesting schedule for these measures, which are each one third of the total award, is:\n\n|         | rTSR  1   | SALES/sqm   | ROFE   | TOTAL  % MAX   |\n|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------|\n| Entry   | 16.66%    | 6.66%       | 6.66%  | 29.98%         |\n| Target  | n/a       | 20.00%      | 20.00% |                |\n| Stretch | 33.34%    | 33.33%      | 33.33% | 100%           |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a2\n\nRelative TSR\n\n\u00a2\n\nSales per square metre\n\n\u00a2\n\nReturn on Funds Employed\n\n## Assessing individual performance:\n\nThe Board has discretion to adjust the vesting outcome for individuals, which may be reduced (including to zero) for behaviour inconsistent with our Ways-of-Working or Core Values (see malus policy on page 68). These would be the most serious of cases that would not have been adequately dealt with through normal performance management or consequence frameworks.\n\n## Delivering LTI Outcomes:\n\nExecutive KMP are awarded a maximum value of 170% of TFR as at the beginning of the performance period. Awards of performance rights are made at face value based on the five-day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) up to and including 1 July at the beginning of the performance period. Dividends that would have been earned and reinvested over the performance period vest in the form of additional shares subject to the performance conditions. The deferred nature of LTI arrangements also provides a risk management lever to facilitate malus policy application during the performance period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Performance of this metric was above Stretch.\n\nReturn on Funds Employed 1 Group ROFE for the purposes of the LTI metric for F21 was 15.4%, an increase of 150bps over the threeyear plan period.

Amounts include:\n\n- \u00b7 Total fixed remuneration received (including base salary, superannuation, and car allowance).\n- \u00b7 Relocation and other benefits received, including the deemed premium in respect of Director's and O/fficer's indemnity insurance ($4,421).\n- \u00b7 Cash STI received for business and individual performance in F21.\n- \u00b7 Equity that vested during the year at face value for each plan.\n- \u00b7 Equity granted in F21 and all unvested equity awards (Share Rights for DSTI and Performance Rights for LTI).\n\nAt the end of F21, the demerger of Endeavour Group (ASX:EDV) had an impact on the operation of Woolworths Group's share plans. Unvested share rights or performance rights did not receive Endeavour Group shares upon demerger. This reduced the value of these rights after Woolworths share price traded lower to reflect the demerger of Endeavour.\n\nConsistent with the Group share plan rules, and to maintain the integrity of our Group share plans so that team members were, on balance, no better or worse o/ff as a result of the demerger, the underlying unvested awards were adjusted by increasing the number of share rights or performance rights by a factor of 1.1653, determined using a standard formula 1 . This variation was applied to the following plans that were on foot at the time of the demerger, and is reflected in the individual balances in the Executive KMP tables below:\n\n- \u00b7 Awards that vested in F21: F19 DSTI and F19-21 WISP.\n- \u00b7 Awards that may vest in the future: F20 DSTI, F20-22 WISP, and F21-23 WISP.\n\nThe above variation also applies to awards retained by departed Endeavour Group team members. For these team members, it was determined that the portion of any unvested WISP rights that related to tenure after the demerger would not be cash settled and were forfeited.\n\nAwards from the F19 DSTI and F19-21 WISP vested on 1 July 2021 for our Executive KMP. The disclosed value of the vested awards uses the Woolworths Group five-day VWAP up to and including 1 July 2021.

        "page_content": "## 2.4 TERMS OF EXECUTIVE KMP SERVICE AGREEMENTS\n\nAll Executive KMP are employed on service agreements that detail the components of remuneration paid but do not prescribe how remuneration levels are to be modified from year to year. The agreements do not provide for a fixed term, although the service agreements may be terminated on specified notice. The notice period is 12 months for the CEO and six months for all other Executive KMP. Below is a summary of the termination provisions for Executive KMP.\n\n## Termination by Company\n\n## Termination by Executive KMP\n\nWhere the notice period is worked:\n\n- \u00b7 Total fixed remuneration is paid in respect of and for the duration of the notice period.\n\nWhere the notice period is paid in lieu:\n\n- \u00b7 Total fixed remuneration in respect of the notice period (and, if appropriate, a reasonable estimate of STI) is paid as a lump sum.\n\nIn both circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 The extent to which STI, DSTI and LTI arrangements remain in place will be treated in accordance with the relevant rules for the award, including any exercise of discretion by the Board. Refer to Section 3.3 for further details.\n\nIf termination is for cause:\n\n- \u00b7 Only accrued leave and unpaid total fixed remuneration for days worked is paid.\n- \u00b7 STI, DSTI and LTI are forfeited.\n\nWhere the notice period is worked:\n\n- \u00b7 Total fixed remuneration is paid in respect of and for the duration of the notice period.\n\nWhere the notice period is paid in lieu:\n\n- \u00b7 Total fixed remuneration in respect of the notice period is paid as a lump sum.\n\nIn both circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 The extent to which STI is payable will be treated in accordance with the relevant rules for the award, including any exercise of discretion by the Board.\n- \u00b7 Unvested DSTI and LTI are treated in accordance with the relevant rules for the award and at the discretion of the Board. Refer to Section 3.3 for further detail.\n\nIn addition, and upon further payment (where required), the Company may invoke a restraint period of up to 12 months following separation, preventing Executive KMP from engaging in any business activity with competitors.\n\n## 2.5 REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK CHANGES FOR F22\n\nIn F21, the People Committee commissioned PwC to undertake a comprehensive independent review of the Group's current remuneration framework. The purpose of the review was to confirm that the remuneration framework remains fit for purpose, recognising Woolworths Group's significant growth in recent years, an evolving business, with changing company portfolio strategy, and operating amidst changing external stakeholder expectations of remuneration for large ASX listed companies.\n\nThe review confirmed that the current remuneration framework is fit for purpose, demonstrating a strong link between pay and performance, and is relatively aligned to the broader Australian market and as such, the Board determined that no significant change was required. However, the progress of the Group's transformation over F21 led the Board to introduce a number of changes to strengthen alignment of the performance measures with the Group's strategic objectives.\n\nThese changes are outlined on the following page.",

To achieve this alignment, the Board retains discretion over final performance and incentive outcomes, and recognises that there are cases where adjustments should be made. The Board considers PC recommendations and consequences of risk-related matters, including whether malus should be applied in the process of finalising incentive and reward outcomes. In determining reward outcomes, the Board will also pay specific attention to items that are:\n\n- \u00b7 Outside of the control of management.\n- \u00b7 The result of portfolio/strategy changes implemented but not envisaged in the original performance targets.\n- \u00b7 Due to significant change in asset valuations outside the normal course of business.\n- \u00b7 Significant risk management and compliance matters.\n\n## 3.2 ROLE OF THE PEOPLE COMMITTEE (PC)\n\nThe PC operates under its own Charter and reports to the Board. The role of the PC is to provide advice and assistance to the Board in relation to people management and remuneration policies, so that remuneration outcomes for senior executives are appropriate and aligned to company performance and shareholder expectations.\n\nThe PC reviews the CEO's proposal for performance and incentive outcomes with a risk lens. This incorporates advice from the CRO, CLO, CPO, and Head of Internal Audit, as well as consultation with Committee Chairs and all Directors to help inform its recommendations to the Board on the consequence of risk-related matters on variable remuneration of the CEO and his direct reports, and overall Group STI and LTI outcomes.\n\nA copy of the PC Charter is available on the company's website: www.woolworthsgroup.com.au\n\nThe chair of the Board and the chair of the PC regularly engage with external stakeholders on remuneration arrangements.\n\n## Independent Remuneration Advisors\n\nWhere appropriate, the Board and the PC consult external remuneration advisors. When such external remuneration advisors are selected, the Board considers potential conflicts of interest. Advisors' terms of engagement regulate their access to, and (where required) set out their independence from, members of Woolworths Group management.\n\nThe requirement for external remuneration advisor services is assessed annually in the context of matters the PC needs to address. External advice is used as a guide, and does not serve as a substitute for Directors' thorough consideration of the relevant matters.\n\nThe Board and PC engaged PwC as its independent Remuneration Advisor. While Woolworths seeks regular input from PwC, no remuneration recommendations, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), were made by our remuneration advisors.",

At the 2020 AGM, shareholders again approved providing the Board with discretion to determine how unvested share rights awards will be treated when an executive ceases employment.\n\nThe approach the Board would expect to take when exercising this discretion is:\n\n| REASON FOR LEAVING                                                      | DEFERRED STI                                                                                     | UNVESTED LTI                                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Genuine retirement                                                      | Remain on foot until the end  of the deferral period and vest                                    | Award pro-rated for portion  of the performance period  participant has worked and  remains 'on foot' until the end  of the performance period |\n|                                                                         | at that time                                                                                     | Death, illness and incapacity                                                                                                                  |\n| Termination for cause/gross misconduct/ poor performance                | Award forfeited                                                                                  | Award forfeited                                                                                                                                |\n| Resignation                                                             | Award forfeited                                                                                  | Award forfeited                                                                                                                                |\n| Mutual separation, redundancy, or other  reasons as determined by Board | The Board will determine the appropriate treatment in the circumstances  on a case by case basis | The Board will determine the appropriate treatment in the circumstances  on a case by case basis                                               |\n\nIn cases of resignation, the Board will consider the circumstances surrounding each case to allow for the appropriate treatment. For instance, where the executive is not resigning to join a direct competitor and all reasonable steps have been taken to continue to support the success of the business through to their final date of employment, the Board may consider it appropriate to allow some incentive awards to remain on foot.\n\nIn any case, where an award remains on foot post employment, the Board retains absolute discretion under the various plan rules as to the final vesting outcome. The Board will continue to monitor the executive post employment and if they do not meet their post-employment obligations, the Board may lapse any remaining awards. For example, in cases where:\n\n- \u00b7 The executive resigns to join a competitor organisation, or in the Board's opinion the executive does not support the business to their final day of employment, any unvested DSTI and LTI will generally lapse.\n- \u00b7 The executive retires from Woolworths, but then at a later date (and prior to vesting of awards) undertakes actions inconsistent with retirement, it may result in the Board reconsidering the treatment of any unvested awards.\n\nThe Board will disclose any exercise of discretion in relation to Executive KMP in the Remuneration Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Total Board and Committee fees paid during F21 were $3,208,114 (refer to Section 5.1 for individual details).\n\nNon-executive Directors do not receive variable pay and no directors' fees are paid to Executive Directors.\n\nThe table below provides a summary of F21 Board and Committee fees:\n\n| BOARD AND COMMITTEE FEES ($)  1   | CHAIR F21 FEE  INCL. SUPER   | MEMBER F21 FEE  INCL. SUPER   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Woolworths Group Board            | $790,531                     | $254,990                      |\n| Audit and Finance Committee  2    | $65,000                      | $32,500                       |\n| People Committee  3               | $65,000                      | $32,500                       |\n| Risk Committee  4                 | $65,000                      | $32,500                       |\n| Sustainability Committee          | $65,000                      | $32,500                       |\n| Nomination Committee              | Nil                          | Nil                           |\n\n- 4 The Risk Committee was established on 1 May 2021.\n\n## 4.2 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' MINIMUM SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT\n\nNon-executive Directors are required to hold a minimum number of shares for alignment with other shareholders. The minimum shareholding requirement is:\n\n- \u00b7 Chair - 200% of the annual Chair fee by 1 July 2022.\n- \u00b7 Other Non-executive Directors - 100% of the annual base fee within three years of appointment.\n\nThe shares or share instruments may be held personally, by a close family member, within a self-managed superannuation fund, or by a family trust or private company.\n\nAs of the financial year end, all Non-executive Directors hold, or are on track to achieve, the minimum shareholding requirement. Details of the current shareholdings for Non-executive Directors as at 27 June 2021 are provided in Section 5.3.\n\n## 4.3 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' EQUITY PLAN\n\nThe Non-executive Director equity plan (the plan) was introduced to encourage and facilitate share ownership. The plan provides a pre-set automated mechanism for participants to acquire shares, recognising that Non-executive Directors can often be limited in their ability to purchase shares because of Australian insider trading laws. Non-executive Director share rights are allocated quarterly at the same time as the underlying shares are issued to the plan's trustee. For Australian-based directors, these rights convert into ordinary shares each half year; and for US-based directors, these rights convert into shares at the end of the director's tenure or other prescribed events (with additional shares equivalent to the dividends that would have been earned and reinvested on those rights), subject to compliance with the Securities Trading policy.\n\nThe plan supports the minimum shareholding requirement for Board members as it allows Non-executive Directors to reach the minimum shareholding requirements more quickly, as shares are acquired on a pre-tax basis. Details of the share rights allocated to Non-executive Directors are set out in Section 5.2.\n\nThe Group will be seeking shareholder approval to continue this plan for a further three years at the 2021 AGM.\n\n3\n\nDIRE\n\nCT\n\nREPOR\n\nT\n\nORS'\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Financial Report of the Company is for the 52-week period ended 27 June 2021 and comprises the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The comparative period is for the 52-week period ended 28 June 2020.\n\nThe Financial Report was authorised for issue by the directors on 26 August 2021.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Australian dollars and amounts have been rounded to the nearest million dollars unless otherwise stated, in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, derivative assets and liabilities, and certain financial liabilities which have been measured at fair value, as explained in the accounting policies.\n\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise stated.\n\nCertain comparative amounts have been re-presented to conform with the current period's presentation to better reflect the nature of the financial position and performance of the Group. In addition:\n\n- \u00b7 On 18 June 2021, the Group obtained shareholder approval for the separation of Endeavour Group, which resulted in two of the Group's separate major business lines, Endeavour Drinks and Hotels, being classified as discontinued operations. In accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations , the Group has:\n- -presented the profit or loss from Endeavour Group separately from its continuing operations in its Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in the current period and restated the prior period. Refer to Note 5.2 for further details;\n- -presented the assets and liabilities of Endeavour Group as held for distribution separately from other assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 27 June 2021 with no re-presentation of amounts presented in the prior period. Refer to Note 5.3 for further details; and\n- -continued to present the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows including both continuing operations and discontinued operations.\n- \u00b7 The Group has reclassified $266 million from non-current lease liabilities to current lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 28 June 2020, to reflect that these lease liabilities are expected to settle within 12 months after the reporting period. This has not resulted in a change to the total liabilities or net assets of the Group at 28/uni00A0June 2020.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 , and Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations.\n\nCompliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that the Financial Report complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Consequently, this Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with and complies with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section sets out the significant accounting policies upon which the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared as a whole and significant accounting policies not otherwise described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Where a significant accounting policy is specific to a note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the policy is described within that note. This section also shows information on new accounting standards, amendments, and interpretations not yet adopted and the impact they will have on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 1.2.1 Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company incorporate the assets, liabilities, and results of all subsidiaries as at and for the period ended 27 June 2021. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nIntragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 1.2.2 Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.\n\nCost is determined on a weighted average basis after deducting supplier rebates and settlement discounts, and includes other costs incurred to bring inventory to its present condition and location for sale.\n\nNet realisable value of inventory has been determined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated selling expenses.\n\n## 1.2.3 Investments in associates\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control over the financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and are accounted for using the equity method by including the Group's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of associates in the carrying amount of the investment until the date on which significant influence ceases. Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment in associates.\n\n## 1.2.4 Foreign currency\n\n## (i) Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Australian dollars (AUD), which is the Company's functional currency.\n\n## (ii) Foreign currency transactions (entities with a functional currency of AUD)\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into AUD using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to AUD at the reporting date at the following exchange rates:\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNT\n\n## APPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATE\n\n| Monetary assets and liabilities                                 | Reporting date      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost | Date of transaction |\n\nForeign exchange di/fferences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the period in which they arise except:\n\n- \u00b7 Exchange di/fferences on transactions entered to hedge certain foreign currency risks (refer to Note 4.7); and\n- \u00b7 Items noted within paragraph (iii).",

These monetary items and related hedges are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation and are reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss upon disposal of the net investment.\n\n## 1.2.5 Goods and Services Tax (GST)\n\nRevenue, expenses, and assets are recognised net of GST, except where the GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the expense or cost of the asset.\n\nReceivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amounts of GST recoverable from or payable to the taxation authorities are included as a current asset or current liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\nCash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from or payable to taxation authorities are classified as operating cash flows.\n\n## 1.2.6 New and amended standards adopted by the Group\n\nThe Group has adopted all relevant new and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board which are e/ffective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 29 June 2020. None of the new standards or amendments to standards that are mandatory for the first time materially a/ffected any of the amounts recognised in the current period or any prior period.\n\n## 1.2.7 Issued standards and interpretations not early adopted\n\nThe table below lists the standards and amendments to standards on issue but not yet e/ffective that were available for early adoption and were applicable to the Group. The reported profit or loss and financial position of the Group are not expected to change on adoption of any of the amendments to current standards listed below, unless stated otherwise, as they do not result in any changes to the Group's existing accounting policies.\n\n| EFFECTIVE DATE   | ADOPTION DATE   | NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS, AND AMENDMENTS                                                                                    | REFERENCE   |\n|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| 1 January 2021   | 28 June 2021    | Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate  Benchmark Reform - Phase 2                                         | AASB 2020-8 |\n| 1 April 2021     | 28 June 2021    | Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - COVID-19-Related  Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021                            | AASB 2021-3 |\n| 1 January 2022   | 27 June 2022  1 | Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Annual  Improvements 2018-2020 and Other Amendments                               | AASB 2020-3 |\n| 1 January 2023   | 26 June 2023  1 | Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Classification  of Liabilities as Current or Non-current                          | AASB 2020-1 |\n| 1 January 2023   | 26 June 2023  1 | Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Disclosure  of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates         | AASB 2021-2 |\n| 1 January 2023   | 26 June 2023  1 | Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Deferred Tax  related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction | AASB 2021-5 |\n\n- 1 This represents the date the amendment is mandatorily e/ffective for the Group.

The estimates, judgements, and assumptions are based on historical experience, adjusted for current market conditions, and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and are reviewed on a regular basis. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and judgements which involve a higher degree of complexity or that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next period are included in the following notes:\n\n- \u00b7 Note 3.2 - Other financial assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Note 3.3 - Leases;\n- \u00b7 Note 3.6 - Impairment of non-financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 Note 3.9 - Provisions.\n\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision a/ffects only that period; or in the period and future periods if the revision a/ffects both current and future periods.",

An expense of $44 million was recognised in the period relating to the estimated redundancy costs for impacted team members.\n\n## Metro asset impairment\n\nDuring the period, the Group recognised expenses totalling $50 million relating to non-cash asset impairments and other store exit costs for 13 Metro Food Stores. The charge is reflective of the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the Metro network's performance.\n\n## Gain on disposal of previously held equity interest in Quantium\n\nDuring the period, the Group recognised a $221 million net gain on disposal of its previously held interest in Quantium.\n\nFollowing the Group's acquisition of an additional equity interest in Quantium, the Group's previously held equity interest of 47.2% was treated as if it were disposed of and reacquired at fair value. Accordingly, it was remeasured to its acquisition-date fair value and, when compared to its carrying amount, a gain of $228 million was recognised.\n\nIn addition, the Group recognised a $7 million net charge for transaction and integration costs and other transaction related gains.\n\n## Transaction costs\n\nDuring the period, the Group incurred $68 million in transaction costs related to the demerger of Endeavour Group ($48/uni00A0million) and costs associated with the acquisition of PFD ($20 million). The costs include advisor fees and legal and other regulatory costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's period ended 27 June 2021 (F21) trading performance was strong with sales growth of 5.7%, EBIT from continuing operations up 39.2% to $2,823 million, and profit after tax from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent entity up 72.7% to $1,606 million. After very strong EBIT growth in the first half of F21 (H1 F21), EBIT growth for the second half of F21 (H2 F21) was impacted by the cycling of COVID-19 from late February in the prior period.\n\nThe financial performance of the Group's reportable segments, including the impacts of COVID-19, is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Australian Food - sales increased by 5.4% for the period. H1 F21 sales growth of 10.6% benefitted from COVID-19-related demand. H2 F21 sales growth of 0.2% was impacted by cycling 10.4% sales growth in H2 of the period ended 28/uni00A0June/uni00A02020 (F20) from COVID-19-related pantry loading. COVID-19 costs of $205 million (excluding discretionary team discount and bonus payments) remained material but declined significantly on the prior period and, together with gross margin improvements, led to 13.7% EBIT growth for the period. In Woolworths Supermarkets, store-originated sales increased by 2.0% for F21 driven by a 7.2% increase in H1 F21. Sales slowed as expected in H2 F21 as customers shopped more frequently with smaller basket sizes. In WooliesX, eCommerce sales increased 74.7% compared to the prior period with sales penetration of 7.9%. Customer scores were broadly in line with the prior period with improvements in Ease of Pick up, Queue Wait Time and Fruit & Veg despite the ongoing disruption from COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 New Zealand Food - sales growth in H1 F21 was impacted by low market growth, particularly during the summer tourist season. In H2 F21, sales declined by 7.8% as the business cycled New Zealand's restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period. EBIT declined 6.4% for the period reflecting the lower sales. eCommerce sales grew 27.7% despite cycling elevated sales from COVID-19 impacts in H2 F20.\n- \u00b7 BIG W - after sales growth of 20.1% in H1 F21, sales growth moderated in H2 F21 but remained positive at 2.3% despite the negative impact of lockdowns across Victoria and New South Wales in the half. Gross margin improved with H2 F21 category mix changes due to cycling elevated sales of lower margin COVID-19-impacted categories, including Leisure and Toys and Home Essentials in F20. EBIT increased by 344.9% in the period to $172 million.\n- \u00b7 Endeavour Drinks - sales increased by 9.6% with EBIT increasing by 17.7%, reflecting a continuation of the in-home consumption and premiumisation trends. eCommerce sales increased 34.7% in F21 with sales penetration of 8.4%. Penetration has remained high even in periods when lockdowns and on-premise restrictions have eased.\n- \u00b7 Hotels - delivered materially higher earnings than the prior period with EBIT increasing 52% to $261 million. While some disruption to trading continued due to lockdowns, sales and EBIT growth in H2 F21 benefitted from cycling a period where venues were closed for most of the final four months of F20. The most significant impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions was in the key state of Victoria, where operations were somewhat impacted throughout the period. Hotels re-entered lockdown in early July 2020 and re-opened in early November with capacity limits and trading restrictions in place. There were further short-term snap lockdowns in both February and June.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTING IMPACTS OF COVID-19\n\nIn addition to the impact on financial performance, the Group has also considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across its businesses.

Revenue is recognised when control of the goods has transferred to the customer or when the service is provided at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled.\n\nFor sale of goods in-store, control of the goods transfers to the customer at the point the customer purchases the goods in-store. For sale of goods online, control of the goods transfers to the customer at the point the goods are delivered to, or collected by, the customer. Where payment for the goods is received prior to control transferring to the customer, revenue recognition is deferred in contract liabilities within trade and other payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position until the goods have been delivered to, or collected by, the customer.\n\n## Loyalty program\n\nRewards points granted by the Group provide customers with a material right to a discount on future purchases. The amounts allocated to rewards points are deferred in contract liabilities within trade and other payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position until redeemed by the customer.\n\n2\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

These business units o/ffer di/fferent products and services and are managed separately. The segment disclosures present the financial performance of each business unit and other material items.\n\n## 2.2.1 Operating segment reporting from continuing operations\n\nReportable segments from continuing operations are identified on the basis of internal reports on the business units of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Board in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. These business units o/ffer di/fferent products and services and are managed separately.\n\nThe Group's reportable segments from continuing operations are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Australian Food - procurement of food and related products for resale and provision of services to customers in Australia;\n- \u00b7 New Zealand Food - procurement of food and drinks for resale and provision of services to customers in New Zealand;\n- \u00b7 BIG W - procurement of discount general merchandise products for resale to customers in Australia; and\n- \u00b7 Other - consists of the Group's other operating segments that are not separately reportable as well as various support functions, including property and central overhead costs, and consolidation and elimination journals.\n\nThere are varying levels of integration between the Group's reportable segments from continuing operations. This includes the common usage of property and services and administration functions. Intersegment pricing is determined on an arm's length basis.\n\nOn 18 June 2021, the Group obtained shareholder approval for the separation of Endeavour Group, which resulted in two of the Group's separate major business lines, Endeavour Drinks and Hotels, being classified as discontinued operations. Consequently, both reportable segments are no longer presented in the segment disclosures from continuing operations for the current and prior periods. Refer to Note 5.2 for further details.\n\nThe primary reporting measure of the reportable segments is earnings before interest, tax, and significant items which is consistent with the way management monitor and report the performance of these segments.\n\n| 2021                                                         | AUSTRALIAN  FOOD  $M   | NEW ZEALAND  FOOD  $M   | BIG W  $M   | OTHER  $M   | CONSOLIDATED  CONTINUING  OPERATIONS  $M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Revenue from the sale of goods and services                  | 44,441                 | 6,652                   | 4,583       | 18          | 55,694                                     |\n| Other revenue 1                                              | -                      | -                       | -           | 117         | 117                                        |\n| Total revenue                                                | 44,441                 | 6,652                   | 4,583       | 135         | 55,811                                     |\n| Earnings/(loss) before interest, tax,  and significant items | 2,432                  | 336                     | 172         | (176)       | 2,764                                      |\n| Significant items 2                                          | (94)                   | -                       | -           | 153         | 59                                         |\n| Earnings/(loss) before interest and tax                      | 2,338                  | 336                     | 172         | (23)        | 2,823                                      |\n| Finance costs                                                |                        |                         |             |             | (613)                                      |\n| Profit before income tax                                     |                        |                         |             |             | 2,210                                      |\n| Income tax expense                                           |                        |                         |             |             | (604)                                      |\n| Profit for the period from continuing operations             |                        |                         |             |             | 1,606                                      |\n| Depreciation and amortisation - lease assets                 | 692                    | 117                     | 106         | 30          | 945                                        |\n| Depreciation and amortisation - non-lease assets             | 882                    | 136                     | 70          | 46          | 1,134                                      |\n| Capital expenditure 3                                        | 1,209                  | 322                     | 102         | 541         | 2,174                                      |",

The Group applies the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade and other receivables that share similar credit risk characteristics and days past due are grouped and then assessed for collectability as a whole.\n\nASSETS AND\n\nLIABILITIES\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group assesses the expected credit losses associated with loans provided to related parties on a forward-looking basis. The Group applies the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the loan.\n\n## Convertible and Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) notes\n\nA SAFE note is a convertible note with no maturity date, no interest rate, an automatic conversion on any priced share issue, and a valuation cap (the maximum value to which the SAFE will convert).\n\nThe Group's convertible and SAFE notes are financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. The convertible and SAFE notes are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and, in subsequent periods, are measured at fair value with any change recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Put option over non-controlling interest\n\nThe Group's put option over non-controlling interest is initially recognised at the present value of the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise with a corresponding entry to other reserves (refer to Note 4.4 for further details). At each reporting period, the discount is unwound in finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Any changes in the estimate of the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\n## Fair value of put option over non-controlling interest\n\nThe fair value of the put option liability over the non-controlling interest of Quantium has been determined as the present value of the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise.\n\n## Amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise\n\nIn determining the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise, the Group considers the key terms of the shareholders agreement and the business outlook. The fair value of the put option liability is determined using a revenue multiple, which is applied to the forecast of Quantium's last 12 months of revenue at the time of option exercise. The revenue multiple to be used is based on an agreed multiple adjusted for changes in revenue growth and EBITDA margin growth over a three-year period. Reasonably possible changes to these inputs would result in a change in the valuation. Refer to the sensitivity analysis in Note 4.7.4 for further details.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise has been discounted using the Group's marginal cost of debt for borrowing over a similar term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nF\n\nR\n\nI\n\nNAN\n\nE\n\nPOR\n\nC\n\nT\n\nI\n\nAL\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

A lease conveys the right to direct the use and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A lease liability and corresponding lease asset are recognised at commencement of the lease.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be determined, at the Group's incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease term. Lease payments (excluding non-lease components) include:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 Amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 Exercise price of a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise; and\n- \u00b7 Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. When there is a change in lease term or a change in future lease payments, lease liabilities are remeasured, with a corresponding adjustment to lease assets.\n\n## Lease assets\n\nLease assets are initially measured at cost comprising the initial lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received), any initial direct costs, and any restoration costs. Lease assets are subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. Lease assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy adopted for non-financial assets in Note 3.6.\n\n## Short-term leases\n\nShort-term leases are those with a lease term of 12 months or less. The costs associated with these leases are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss as incurred.\n\n## Holdover leases\n\nIn assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to extend or renew a lease in holdover, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to remain in the leased premises and whether a lease asset and lease liability should be recognised.\n\n## Non-lease components\n\nThe Group separates the non-lease components for property leases based on a residual method using property outgoing market data and separates the non-lease components for other leases based on the individual contract breakdown of these costs or otherwise best estimate of these costs. Non-lease components of lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss as incurred and include items such as embedded property outgoings and repairs and maintenance.",

The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which a/ffects this assessment. Extension options are most common for property leases. At the end of the reporting period, the weighted average lease expiries for the portfolio of leases were:\n\n| WEIGHTED AVERAGE LEASE EXPIRY  1   |   2021 YEARS |   2020  YEARS |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Australian Food                    |         10.5 |          10.9 |\n| New Zealand Food                   |          9.3 |           9.8 |\n| BIG W                              |          8.7 |           8.8 |\n| Endeavour Drinks                   |          8.7 |           8.5 |\n| Hotels                             |         14.6 |          15   |\n| Other                              |          6.6 |           7.7 |\n| Group ! 2                          |         10.4 |          10.7 |\n\n- 1 Represents the weighted average number of years from the end of the reporting period to the end of the reasonably certain lease term.\n\nDuring the current financial period, revising lease terms for exercising extension options resulted in an increase in recognised lease liabilities and lease assets of $946 million (2020: $223 million).\n\n## Discount rates\n\nIn calculating the lease liability, the lease payments are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Determining the incremental borrowing rate requires significant judgement. The discount rate is derived from key external market based rates, the Group's credit margin, and the length of the lease.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the weighted average incremental borrowing rate for the Group was 4.4% 3 (2020: 4.8%).\n\n- 3 The Group's weighted average incremental borrowing rate includes leases relating to Endeavour Group, which are included in liabilities associated with assets held for distribution at 27 June 2021. The Group's weighted average incremental borrowing rate at 27 June 2021, excluding the impact from the portfolio of leases relating to Endeavour Group, was 4.4%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and a proportion of overheads. The cost of development properties (those being constructed or developed for future use) includes borrowing, holding, and development costs until the asset is complete.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nAssets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives to their residual values. Leasehold improvements are amortised over the expected useful life of the improvement. Useful lives are reassessed each reporting period. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have di/fferent useful lives, they are accounted for as separate assets.\n\nThe expected useful lives are as follows:\n\n| Buildings              | 25-40 years                                             |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Plant and equipment    | 2.5-20 years                                            |\n| Leasehold improvements | Up to 25 years (retail properties) or 40 years (hotels) |\n\n## Proceeds from sale of assets\n\nThe gross proceeds from asset sales are recognised at the date that an unconditional contract of sale is exchanged with the purchaser or when title passes. The net gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## Impairment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy for impairment of non-financial assets disclosed in Note 3.6.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Goodwill arises when the Group acquires a business at a cost which exceeds the fair value of net assets acquired and represents the synergies expected to arise from the purchase. Brand names have mainly been recognised as a result of New Zealand supermarket acquisitions and help to identify and di/fferentiate the Group's network from others. Licences allow the Group to conduct certain business activities, including the resale of drinks and provision of leisure and hospitality services. Software includes programs and operating systems used by the Group. Other includes customer relationships and contracts and intellectual property and algorithms.\n\n## 3.5.1 Carrying amounts of, and movements in, intangible assets\n\n| 2021                                                           | GOODWILL  $M   | BRAND  NAMES  $M   | LIQUOR AND  GAMING  LICENCES  $M   | SOFTWARE  1 $M   | OTHER  $M   | TOTAL  $M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Cost                                                           | 2,993          | 265                | -

The Group reviews the carrying amount of assets and CGUs at least annually and/or when there is an indication that the asset or CGU may be impaired.\n\nThe Group's impairment testing is performed at both a total business unit level (group of CGUs) and an individual CGU level. The Group assessed the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, lease assets, goodwill and intangible assets and no impairments were recognised at the total business unit level. At an individual CGU level, no impairment charge was recognised other than for Metro Food Stores.\n\n## Metro Food Stores\n\nOn 23 June 2021, the Group announced it had completed a review of its Metro Food Stores network, given the impact of COVID-19 on sales in CBD and public transit sites. A total impairment charge of $47 million has been recognised in branch expenses relating to store and lease assets across 13 stores. In addition, the Group recognised $3/uni00A0million of onerous contract and make good provisions for these stores.\n\nIn determining the impairment charge for these stores, the Group calculated the recoverable amount for each store based on a discounted cash flow model. The recoverable amount of each store was determined using assumptions included in the three-year strategic plan, which was formally approved by the Board during the second half of the period. The decrease in the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units reflects the material and negative impacts of COVID-19 on customer shopping habits, foot tra/ffic, and sales in key transit tra/ffic locations and a balanced view on the speed of recovery of CBD and transit customer movements and the likely impact of this on Metro Food Stores.\n\nThe assessment of the recoverable amount represents management's best estimate, taking into account risks, uncertainties, and opportunities for improvement in each cash-generating unit. Management will continue to monitor the Metro Food Stores network to assess performance against these estimates and it is possible that future asset impairments may be required in relation to the Metro Food Stores network. For the 13 stores where store and lease assets were impaired, any change in assumption would result in a maximum additional impairment charge of $8 million, at which point these stores would have store and lease assets with a carrying value of nil.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTING IMPACTS OF COVID-19\n\n## Calculation of recoverable amount\n\nThe three-year F22 Board approved business plan was used in assessing value in use. This plan incorporates the estimated impact on the Group from COVID-19, which has shaped trading through the last 12-18 months. Refer to critical accounting estimates for further details.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe carrying value of assets subject to impairment testing includes inventories which are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value. There have been no material changes to the Group's inventory provisions as a result of COVID-19.",

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, recoverable amount is assessed at the cash-generating unit (CGU) level, which is the smallest group of assets generating cash inflows independent of other CGUs that benefit from the use of the respective asset. Goodwill is allocated to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, identified according to operating segments and grouped at the lowest levels for which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nFor properties, the recoverable amount is assessed with reference to external valuations obtained every three years using current market rental value with regard to recent sales of comparable sites. Internal value in use assessments are performed during the intervening periods.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nImpairment losses recognised in respect of a CGU are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.\n\n## Reversal of impairment\n\nAn impairment loss is reversed, other than for goodwill, if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The three-year F22 Board approved business plan incorporates the estimated impact on the Group from COVID-19 restrictions, the vaccine rollout, and the market conditions forecast through the recovery phase. Whilst there continues to be a significant degree of uncertainty associated with the impacts of COVID-19, the assessment of the recoverable amounts represents management's best estimate taking into account the impacts on the Group and, other than in relation to the Metro Food Stores network, this has not resulted in a material change in the recoverable amount. However, if restrictions result in extensive store closures or disruption to the Group's supply chain, there is a risk of a material change in the recoverable amount which may result in impairment.\n\nLong-term growth rates are based on past experience, expectations of external market operating conditions, and other assumptions which take account of the specific features of each business unit.\n\nThe recoverable amount has been determined using a VIU discounted cash flow model. In assessing VIU, the estimated future pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. Pre-tax discount rates used vary depending on the nature of the business and the country of operation.\n\nThe ranges of rates used in determining recoverable amounts are set out below:\n\n|                       | 2021 %   | 2020 %   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|\n| Long-term growth rate | 2.5      | 2.5      |\n| Pre-tax discount rate | 10-13    | 9-13     |\n\nThe Group believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions applied would not cause the carrying value of assets to exceed their recoverable amount and result in a material impairment based on current economic conditions and CGU performance.",

Woolworths Group Limited is the head entity of the tax consolidated group and has assumed the current tax liabilities of the members in the tax consolidated group (the Woolworths tax group). Income tax expense or benefit, deferred tax assets, and deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary di/fferences of the members of the tax consolidated group are recognised by each subsidiary where the subsidiary would have been able to recognise the deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability on a standalone basis.\n\nThe members of the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax funding agreement with the Company which sets out the funding obligations in respect of income tax amounts. The agreement requires payments by the subsidiary to the Company equal to the income tax liability assumed by the Company. The Company is required to make payment to the subsidiary equal to the current tax asset assumed by the Company.\n\nIn respect of carried forward tax losses brought into the group on consolidation by subsidiary members, the Company will pay the subsidiary member for such losses when these losses are transferred to the tax consolidated group, where the subsidiary member would have been entitled to recognise the benefit of these losses on a standalone basis.\n\nOn 3 February 2020, Endeavour Group Limited and a number of its wholly-owned Australian resident subsidiaries exited the Woolworths tax group. As a result, no further obligation to the Company exists on balance date in relation to the period of time that these entities were a member of the Woolworths tax group.\n\nIncome tax expense of $126 million (2020: $117 million) was charged by the Company to subsidiaries during the period through at call intercompany accounts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nIncome tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss for the period presented comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income, or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax payable represents the amount expected to be paid to taxation authorities on taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary di/fferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled, or asset realised, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary di/fference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that a/ffects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit or in relation to the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary di/fferences or unused tax losses and tax o/ffsets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nThe benefit of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life will flow to the Group on an annual basis, therefore the carrying amount will be recovered through use.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nA liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of annual leave and long service leave.\n\nLiabilities expected to be settled within 12 months are measured at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement.\n\nLiabilities which are not expected to be settled within 12 months are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.\n\n## Self-insurance\n\nThe provision for self-insured risks primarily represents the estimated liability for workers' compensation and public liability claims.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nProvision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those a/ffected by the restructuring that the restructuring will occur.\n\n## Onerous contracts and store exit costs\n\nAn onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil the contract.\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any changes in the estimates and judgements of the provision in future periods will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nWhere a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, with the exception of employee benefits, the cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Employee benefits are discounted by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Rates are reviewed periodically and, given the nature of the estimate, reasonably possible changes are not considered likely to have a material impact.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nIn estimating the value of employee benefits, consideration is given to expected future salary and wage levels (including on-cost rates), experience of employee departures, and periods of service. The assumptions are reviewed periodically and, given the nature of the estimate, reasonably possible changes in assumptions are not considered likely to have a material impact.\n\nIncluded in employee benefits is the team member remediation provision which represents the Group's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation in accordance with the General Retail Industry Award (GRIA) and the Hospitality Industry (General) Award (HIGA). The calculation of this provision involves a substantial volume of data and a significant degree of complexity, interpretation, and estimation. In June 2021, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a statement of claim to the Group challenging the Group's interpretation of certain clauses of the GRIA in its calculation of team member remediation payments. The Group is defending this claim however it is at an early stage of the proceedings and the potential outcome and total costs associated with this matter are uncertain. The Group's exposure may change materially based on the outcome of the legal proceedings.\n\n## Self-insurance\n\nSelf-insurance provisions are determined based on independent actuarial assessments, which consider numbers, amounts, and duration of claims and allow for future inflation and investment returns. Allowance is included for injuries which occurred before the reporting date, but where the claim is expected to be notified after the reporting date. The assumptions are reviewed periodically and, given the nature of the estimate, reasonably possible changes in assumptions are not considered likely to have a material impact.\n\n## Restructuring, onerous contracts, and store exit costs\n\nProvisions for store closures and onerous lease contracts are recognised based on the lower of the estimated unavoidable net costs of meeting all leases and other obligations under the stores and associated contracts, and management's best estimate of the compensation expected to be payable to landlords and other third parties as a result of early termination of contracts. Estimates di/ffer depending on the rent, location, lease exit terms, and management's assessment of the timing and likely termination costs.",

The last date for receipt of election notices for the DRP is 6 September 2021.

Accounting for the demerger is guided by AASB Interpretation 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners . A demerger distribution liability equal to the fair value of the net assets to be distributed of $7,870 million has been recognised at 27 June 2021. The demerger distribution liability has been allocated between a capital reduction ($904 million) and a demerger dividend ($6,966 million). The value of the capital reduction has been determined in accordance with the tax allocation specified by an ATO ruling and has been recognised against share capital. Refer to Note 5.3.2 for further details on demerger accounting.\n\n## Share capital\n\nHolders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per share at shareholders' meetings. In the event of winding up of the Company, ordinary shareholders rank after creditors and are fully entitled to any proceeds on liquidation.\n\n## Share options and performance rights\n\nRefer to Note 6.2 for further details of outstanding options and performance rights. Performance rights carry no rights to dividends and no voting rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group manages its liquidity requirements with a range of short-term money market loans, bank loans, and flexible debt instruments with varying maturities.\n\n## 4.6.1 Capital structure\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure with the objective of enhancing long-term shareholder value through funding its business at an optimised weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe Group returns capital to shareholders when consistent with its long-term capital structure objectives and where it will enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe Group remains committed to solid investment grade credit ratings and a number of actions can be undertaken to support the credit profile, including the sale of non-core assets, further working capital initiatives, and adjusting growth capital expenditure and the property leasing profile. The Group's credit ratings 1 are BBB (stable outlook) according to Standard & Poor's and Baa2 (stable outlook) according to Moody's.\n\n## 4.6.2 Borrowings\n\n## (i) Financing transactions during 2021\n\nIn September 2020, the $654 million US Senior Notes matured. In November 2020, the $229 million European Medium Term Notes also matured. The Group refinanced these maturities with a $1 billion domestic Medium Term Note issuance in May 2020.\n\nIn December 2020, the Group entered into a $384 million bank guarantee facility and $398 million direct surety bond facility. The bank guarantee facility is backed by the international surety market. The facilities support the Group's workers' compensation obligations as a self-insurer, where bank guarantees are issued in favour of Australian workers' compensation authorities. These transactions refinanced the Group's $500 million bank guarantee facility, which matured in January 2021.\n\nIn April 2021, the $424 million US Senior Notes matured and the Group repaid this with its existing surplus cash and bank facilities.\n\n## (ii) Future financing activities\n\nSubject to market conditions, the Group is intending to launch a debt capital markets transaction (total value estimated to be $1,500 million) where the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the long-term funding of the Group's increased investment in Quantium, the acquisition of a controlling interest in PFD, and represents an opportunity to secure long-term, low cost debt and reduce the Group's overall cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

These financial risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk (refer to Note 4.7.1);\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk (refer to Note 4.7.2); and\n- \u00b7 Credit risk (refer to Note 4.7.3).\n\nThese risks a/ffect the fair value measurements applied by the Group, which are detailed in Note 4.7.4.\n\nThe Group adheres to a treasury policy approved by the Board, which set written principles on liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk, and the use of derivatives for hedging purposes. The Treasury function reports on its compliance with the policy to the Board and such compliance is reviewed periodically by the Group's internal auditors.\n\nThe Group holds various types of derivatives to hedge its exposures to variability in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.\n\n## 4.7.1 Market risk\n\n## (i) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that a change in interest rates may negatively impact the Group's cash flow or profitability because the Group's borrowings reset directly in accordance with interest rate benchmarks or reset regularly to current rates influenced by interest rate benchmarks. The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between floating and fixed rate borrowings and through the use of approved derivatives to hedge the risk.\n\n## (ii) Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is the risk that a change in foreign exchange rates may negatively impact the Group's cash flow or profitability because the Group has an exposure to a foreign currency or has foreign currency denominated obligations.\n\nTo hedge against the majority of this exposure, the Group uses approved derivatives to hedge up to 100% of the risk. The exposure to purchases of inventory in foreign currencies is primarily managed through forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options. These have been designated as cash flow hedges and the Group has established a 100% hedge relationship against the identified exposure.\n\nTo hedge the risk of adverse movements in foreign exchange rates in relation to borrowings denominated in foreign currency, the Group enters into cross currency swaps under which it agrees to exchange specified principal and interest foreign currency amounts at an agreed future date at a specified exchange rate. All foreign currency term borrowings are 100% hedged in this way.\n\nForeign currency exposures arising on translation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are predominantly unhedged.",

All cross currency swaps were settled during the period matching the maturity of the underlying debt which was repaid during the period.\n\n## Interest rate swaps - cash flow hedges\n\nAt the reporting date, there were no interest rate swaps designated in a cash flow hedge relationship. All interest rate swaps previously designated in cash flow hedge relationships were settled during the period, matching the maturity of the underlying debt which was repaid during the period.\n\n## Interest rate swaps - fair value hedges\n\nAt the reporting date, interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges have an unrealised gain of $16 million (2020: $20 million unrealised gain). These interest rate swaps are designated to be in a 100% hedge relationship against the identified exposure, and the movement in the unrealised gain of a $4 million loss has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss (2020:/uni00A0$11 million gain), o/ffsetting the movement in the fair value of the hedged item. The weighted average interest rate hedged is BBSW + 1.20% (2020: BBSW + 1.20%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the reporting date, the Group's exposure to foreign currency risk after taking into consideration hedges of foreign currency payables, foreign currency borrowings, and forecast foreign currency transactions is not considered material.\n\n## (vi) Power purchase agreement\n\nThe Group entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) in May 2021 for a period of 10 years commencing January 2022.\n\nThe PPA is not a physical electricity supply contract but operates as a contract for di/fference where a strike price is agreed. If the electricity spot price is higher than the strike price, the counterparty will pay the di/fference to the Group. Similarly, if the electricity spot price is lower than the strike price, the Group will pay the di/fference to the counterparty. The PPA is classified as a derivative and is measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe fair value of the PPA at the execution date was nil. As the timing of the execution of the PPA was close to the end of the period, there has been no material change to the fair value of the PPA. The carrying value of the PPA at 27 June 2021 was nil.\n\n## 4.7.2 Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not have su/fficient cash balances and access to funding sources to meet its cash obligations. This risk arises through the possibility that unusually large amounts may fall due for payment, there is an interruption to cash inflows due to technology incidents or banking system interruption, or there is an interruption to funding sources and markets.\n\nThe treasury policy approved by the Board has set an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for short, medium, and long-term funding requirements.\n\nThe Group maintains a minimum liquidity ratio, which the Treasury function monitors on a daily basis. It maintains a daily liquidity forecast over a 12-month rolling period in advance. The Group may decide to hold higher levels of liquidity from time to time in anticipation of expected requirements or events. To minimise refinancing risk, the Group maintains a diversity of funding sources and debt maturities. Upcoming maturities are included in the liquidity ratio calculation and must be covered by adequate liquidity to repay or refinance them.",

For derivatives which are deliverable, credit risk may also arise from the potential failure of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the respective contracts at maturity.\n\nAt the reporting date, no material credit risk exposure existed in relation to potential counterparty failure on such financial instruments (2020: nil). Other than the loss allowance recognised in relation to trade and other receivables in Note 3.1, no financial assets were impaired or past due.\n\n## 4.7.4 Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nSome of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The following table provides information about how the fair values of these financial assets and financial liabilities are determined. They are grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value measurement inputs are observable.\n\n- Level 1 Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- Level 3 Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n|                                                          |       | FAIR VALUE ASSET   | FAIR VALUE ASSET   | FAIR VALUE LIABILITY   | FAIR VALUE LIABILITY   |                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                          | NOTE  | 2021 $M            | 2020 $M            | 2021 $M                | 2020 $M                | FAIR VALUE  HIERARCHY |\n| Listed equity securities                                 | 3.2   | -                  | 84                 | -                      | -                      | Level 1               |\n| Forward exchange contracts and foreign  currency options | 4.7.1 | 3                  | 9                  | (19)                   | (53)                   | Level 2               |\n| Cross currency and interest rate swaps                   | 4.7.1 | 23                 | 539                | (7)                    | (31)                   | Level 2               |\n| Convertible and SAFE notes                               | 3.2   | 62                 | 45                 | -                      | -                      | Level 2               |\n| Unlisted equity securities                               | 3.2   | 33                 | 10                 | -                      | -                      | Level 3               |\n| Put option over non-controlling interest                 | 3.2   | -                  | -                  | (390)                  | -                      | Level 3               |\n\nThere were no transfers between level 1, level 2, or level 3 during the period.\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis\n\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets, bank and other loans, and non-interest bearing monetary financial liabilities of the Group approximate their fair value.\n\n## Estimation of fair values\n\nAt each reporting period, the Group reviews any material adjustments for level 3 fair values and assesses whether any evidence can be obtained from third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of the Standards, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. Any material valuation adjustments are reported to the Board.\n\nThe following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments categorised within level 2 and level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is determined using a discounted cash flow model where future cash flows are estimated based on market forward exchange rates as at the end of the reporting period and the contract forward rate, discounted by the observable yield curves of the respective currency;\n- \u00b7 The fair value of foreign currency options is determined using a Black-Scholes model;",

Subsequently, at each reporting date, the derivative is remeasured at fair value and the gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, unless the derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge where the gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not due to be realised or settled within 12 months.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nA cash flow hedge is a hedge of an exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could a/ffect profit or loss.\n\nWhere a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge, the e/ffective part of any gain or loss on the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate cash flow hedge reserve within equity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains and losses that were accumulated in equity will be reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed a/ffects profit or loss. The ine/ffective part of any derivative designated as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified immediately into the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Gains or losses removed from equity during the period in relation to interest rate hedge instruments are recognised within finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nA fair value hedge is a hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk and could a/ffect profit or loss. Where a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, together with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in the line item relating to the hedged item.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

During the period, the Group acquired a controlling interest in Quantium.\n\nOn 31 May 2021, the Group acquired an additional equity interest in The Quantium Group Holdings Pty Limited (Quantium) which increased its shareholding from 47% to 75%, resulting in the Group gaining control of Quantium, for a total cash consideration of $223 million. In addition, Quantium minority shareholders have a put option and the Group has an equivalent call option over the remaining 25% of the shares in Quantium, both of which are expected to be exercised after 30 June 2024.\n\nQuantium is a world-class data science and advanced analytics business. Through this transaction the Group aspires to bring together Quantium's advanced analytics capability and the Group's retail capabilities to unlock value across the Group's retail ecosystem.\n\nFrom the date of acquisition, Quantium's contribution to revenue and earnings before interest and tax was not material. If the acquisition had occurred at the start of the reporting period, management estimates that consolidated revenue and consolidated earnings before interest and tax would not have been materially di/fferent to what has been reported.\n\n## 5.1.1 Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n\nThe following table summarises the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:\n\n|                                        | $M   |\n|----------------------------------------|------|\n| Assets                                 |      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents              | 54   |\n| Trade and other receivables  1         | 58   |\n| Lease assets                           | 110  |\n| Property, plant and equipment          | 3    |\n| Intangible assets                      | 191  |\n| Deferred tax assets                    | 11   |\n| Total assets                           | 427  |\n| Liabilities                            |      |\n| Trade and other payables               | 57   |\n| Lease liabilities                      | 110  |\n| Current tax payable                    | 7    |\n| Provisions                             | 18   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities               | 53   |\n| Total liabilities                      | 245  |\n| Total identifiable net assets acquired | 182  |\n\n- 1 Trade and other receivables comprise gross contractual amounts due of $58 million, of which nil was expected to be uncollectable at the date of acquisition.\n\nGROUP\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\n5\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

This represents the di/fference between the fair value of the Group's existing 47% interest ($291 million) and the amount recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position prior to this acquisition ($63 million). This gain has been included in administration expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nThe goodwill is attributable mainly to the skills and technical talent of Quantium's workforce, the benefits from integrating Quantium into the Group's retail ecosystem, and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\n## 5.1.3 Put option\n\nThe Group has a put option liability over the remaining 25% of the shares in Quantium, which is expected to be exercised after 30 June 2024. Notwithstanding that the most likely outcome is that the put option will be exercised after 30 June 2024, minority shareholders can require the Group to purchase their shares at the put option valuation at the date of exercise. For employee shareholders leaving Quantium or employees classified as bad leavers, their shares are required to be acquired at a discount and for other shareholders at no discount.  As the Group is not able to defer payment for more than 12 months, the Group is required to recognise this portion as a current liability.\n\nThe put option liability was initially recognised at the present value of the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise within other financial liabilities with a corresponding charge directly to equity. At 27 June 2021, the carrying value of the put option liability was $390 million, of which $145 million has been recognised as a current financial liability and $245/uni00A0million has been recognised as a non-current financial liability (refer to Note 3.2).\n\nIn each reporting period, the discount on the put option liability is subsequently unwound up to the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise through finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nAny changes in the estimate of the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.",

The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is measured as the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree less the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment in accordance with the policy adopted for non-financial assets in Note 3.6. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nAny contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held interest in the acquired entity is remeasured to its acquisition date fair value. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have a/ffected the amounts recognised as of that date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accounting for demerger transactions is guided by AASB Interpretation 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners . Liabilities for distributions payable to shareholders are measured at the fair value of the net assets to be distributed. The fair value of the Endeavour Group net assets has been determined by reference to the VWAP of Endeavour Group Limited shares traded on the ASX in their first five trading days ($6.21). A demerger distribution liability equal to the fair value of the net assets to be distributed of $7,870 million has been recognised at 27 June 2021, reflecting the obligation to distribute the assets of Endeavour Group to shareholders e/ffective 28 June 2021.\n\nThe demerger distribution liability has been allocated between a capital reduction ($904 million) and a demerger dividend ($6,966/uni00A0million). The value of the capital reduction has been determined in accordance with the tax allocation specified by an ATO ruling and has been recognised against share capital. The demerger dividend, being the di/fference between the fair value of the net assets to be distributed and the capital reduction, has been recognised in a demerger reserve, within equity.\n\nOn 28 June 2021, subsequent to the end of the period, the Group lost control of Endeavour Group and recognised a gain within equity of $6,387 million equal to the di/fference between the net assets of Endeavour Group derecognised on transfer to shareholders (including a loan payable to the Group, which eliminated on consolidation) and the combination of (i) the non-controlling interest share of Endeavour Group's net assets, (ii) the fair value of the investment in Endeavour Group retained by the Group, and (iii) the demerger distribution liability. The gain was recognised within discontinued operations for the 2022 financial period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Assets held for sale or distribution\n\nAssets are classified as either held for sale or distribution. Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and the sale is considered highly probable. Assets are classified as held for distribution if they are available for immediate distribution and the transaction is considered highly probable.\n\nAssets held for sale or distribution are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute or sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, and financial assets which are specifically exempt from this measurement requirement.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell or distribute. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell or distribute of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale or distribution of the asset is recognised at the date of derecognition.\n\nAssets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale or distribution.\n\nInterest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities associated with assets held for sale or distribution continue to be recognised.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following are accounting policies that are significant to the Company only as the related transactions are either not material for the Group or eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost and are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy adopted for non-financial assets in Note 3.6. Dividends received from subsidiaries are recognised in profit or loss when a right to receive the dividend is established.\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nThe Company recognises amounts due from lessees under finance leases as receivables at the amount of the Company's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Company's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.\n\n## 5.6 RELATED PARTIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## This section outlines the Group's transactions with its related parties, such as its subsidiaries and Key Management Personnel.\n\n## Transactions within the Group\n\nDuring the reporting period and previous reporting periods, Woolworths Group Limited advanced loans to, received and repaid loans from, and provided treasury, accounting, legal, taxation, and administrative services to other entities within the Group.\n\nEntities within the Group also exchanged goods and services in sale and purchase transactions. All transactions occurred on the basis of normal commercial terms and conditions. Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.\n\n## Directors and Key Management Personnel\n\nAll transactions with directors and Key Management Personnel (including their related parties) were conducted on an arm's length basis in the ordinary course of business and under normal terms and conditions for customers and employees. Related parties of Key Management Personnel who are employees received normal employee benefits on standard terms and conditions.\n\nThe total remuneration for Key Management Personnel of the Group is as follows:\n\n|                              | 2021 $     | 2020 $     |\n|------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Short-term employee benefits | 12,149,747 | 10,190,022 |\n| Post employment benefits     | 197,807    | 169,512    |\n| Other long-term benefits     | 82,043     | 109,341    |\n| Share-based payments         | 8,825,971  | 6,476,698  |\n|                              | 21,255,568 | 16,945,573 |\n\n## Equity instrument disclosures relating to Key Management Personnel\n\nDetails of equity instruments provided as compensation to Key Management Personnel and shares issued on exercise of these instruments, together with the terms and conditions of the instruments, are disclosed in the Remuneration Report.",

The guarantees are based on independent actuarial advice of the outstanding liability.\n\nNo provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements in respect of these contingencies, however there is a provision of $591 million for self-insured risks (2020: $637 million), which includes liabilities relating to workers' compensation claims, that have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the reporting date.\n\nAs at 27 June 2021, there are class action proceedings against the Group, on behalf of several representative applicants, seeking payments in favour of salaried team members, covered by the General Retail Industry Award, working in Supermarkets, Metro, and BIG W stores.\n\nFrom time to time, entities within the Group are party to various legal actions as well as inquiries from regulators and government bodies that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Consideration has been given to such matters and it has been determined that these matters are not at a stage to support a reasonable evaluation of the likely outcome.\n\n## 6.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section presents the Group's benefits provided to its employees, including remuneration, superannuation, share schemes, and retirement plans.\n\n## 6.2.1 Employee benefits expense from continuing operations\n\n|                              | 2021 $M   | RESTATED 1 2020 $M   |\n|------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Remuneration and on-costs    | 7,742     | 7,673                |\n| Superannuation expense       | 587       | 556                  |\n| Share-based payments expense | 93        | 96                   |\n|                              | 8,422     | 8,325                |\n\n## 6.2.2 Share-based payments\n\n## Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plan\n\nEquity settled share-based payments form part of the remuneration of eligible employees of the Group. The Group continues to operate the Woolworths Incentive Share Plan (WISP).\n\nAll sub-plans within the LTI plan are subject to performance hurdles being met. The Group's sub-plans are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance rights sub-plan - delivers a right to acquire a share at a future date;\n- \u00b7 Performance shares sub-plan - delivers a right to acquire a share immediately; and\n- \u00b7 Cash award sub-plan - delivers a right to acquire cash at a future date.\n\nNo grants have been made under the performance shares or cash award sub-plans.\n\nThe performance rights sub-plan has been used to make long-term incentive o/ffers to eligible employees. Upon exercise, each performance right o/ffered under this sub-plan entitles the holder to one ordinary fully paid Woolworths Group Limited share.\n\nOTHER\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The fair value excludes the e/ffect of non-market based vesting conditions.\n\nThe fair value of instruments with market-based performance conditions (e.g. TSR) is calculated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The probability of achieving market-based performance conditions is incorporated into the determination of the fair value per instrument.\n\nThe fair value of instruments with non-market-based performance conditions (e.g. sales per trading SQM and ROFE) and service conditions and retention rights is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n\nThe fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting period the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of non-market based vesting conditions. Any change in original estimates is recognised in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.\n\n## 6.2.3 Share schemes\n\nThe total shares purchased during the year were 4,385,989 (2020: 3,213,542) at an average price per share of $42.90 (2020:/uni00A0$36.21) to satisfy the vesting of share rights and allocation of shares under the Group's employee share plans.\n\nNo additional expense is recognised in relation to the shares purchased under the Employee Share Purchase Plan and the shares issued under the Non-executive Director Equity Plan as they are acquired out of salary sacrificed remuneration.\n\n## Woolworths Incentive Share Plan\n\n3,373,381 rights were issued under the Woolworths Incentive Share Plan in 2021. Approval for the issue of securities under the Woolworths Incentive Share Plan to the Chief Executive O/fficer and Managing Director was obtained under ASX Listing Rule 10.14.\n\n## Employee Share Purchase Plan (SPP)\n\nThe SPP provides permanent full-time and part-time employees who are Australian tax residents and are aged 18 years or over with the opportunity to purchase shares from pre-tax income via salary sacrifice. The Group pays the associated brokerage costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The defined benefit plan is closed to new members. The assets of the WGSP are held in a sub-plan within AMP SignatureSuper that is legally separated from the Group. The WGSP invests entirely in pooled unit trust products where prices are quoted on a daily basis.\n\nThe WGSP consists of members with defined benefit entitlements and defined contribution benefits. The plan also pays allocated pensions to a small number of pensioners. The following disclosures relate only to the Group's obligation in respect of defined benefit entitlements.\n\nThe Group contributes to the WGSP at rates as set out in the Trust Deed and Rules and the Participation Deed between the Group and AMP Superannuation Limited. Members contribute to the WGSP at rates dependent upon their membership category. The plan provides lump sum defined benefits that are defined by salary and period of membership.\n\nAn actuarial valuation was carried out at both reporting dates by Willis Towers Watson. The principal actuarial assumptions used for the purpose of the valuation are as follows:\n\n|                                  |   2021 % |   2020 % |\n|----------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Discount rate                    |      2.4 |      2.3 |\n| Expected rate of salary increase |      2.5 |      2.5 |\n| Rate of price inflation          |      2   |      2   |\n\nThe average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 6.1 years (2020: 6.4 years) which relates wholly to active participants.\n\n## (i) Categories of plan assets\n\nThe plan invests entirely in pooled superannuation trust products where prices are quoted daily. The asset allocation of the plan has been set taking into account the membership profile, the liquidity requirements of the plan, and risk appetite of the Group.\n\nThe percentage invested in each asset class is as follows:\n\n|                           |   2021 % |   2020 % |\n|---------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Equity instruments        |       54 |       56 |\n| Debt instruments          |       18 |       20 |\n| Real estate               |        8 |        6 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents |        3 |        3 |\n| Other                     |       17 |       15 |\n| Total                     |      100 |      100 |",

At the reporting date, the Group's exposure to reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions, while holding all other assumptions constant, is not considered material.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nThe majority of employees in Australia and New Zealand are part of a defined contribution superannuation scheme and receive fixed contributions from the Group in accordance with the rules of the WGSP and/or any statutory obligations. The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution plans is disclosed as superannuation expense in Note 6.2.1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe net defined benefit asset or liability recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position represents the surplus or deficit in the Group's defined benefit plans which is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount, and deducting the fair value of the plan assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net interest income or expense, service cost and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nPayments to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.\n\n## 6.3 AUDITORS' REMUNERATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section presents the total remuneration of the Group's external auditors for audit, assurance, and other services.\n\nThe auditors' remuneration for the Group is as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                | 2021 $'000   | 2020 $'000   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Deloitte and related network firms                                                             |              |              |\n| Audit or review of the financial report                                                        |              |              |\n| Group                                                                                          | 1,729        | 2,115        |\n| Subsidiaries                                                                                   | 2,713        | 2,562        |\n| Total audit or review of the financial reports                                                 | 4,442        | 4,677        |\n| Statutory assurance services required by legislation to be provided by the auditor             | 40           | 55           |\n| Other assurance and agreed-upon procedures under other legislation or contractual agreements 1 | 613          | 1,269        |\n| Other services:                                                                                |              |              |\n| Tax compliance services                                                                        | 159          | 158          |\n| Consulting services                                                                            | 371          | 1,741        |\n| Other non-assurance services                                                                   | 6            | 134          |\n| Total other services                                                                           | 536          | 2,033        |\n|                                                                                                | 5,631        | 8,034        |",

The fair value was calculated using the VWAP of Endeavour Group Limited shares traded on the ASX in their first five trading days ($6.21). In addition, the Group derecognised the net assets held for distribution to shareholders (including a loan payable to the Group, which eliminated on consolidation) and the non-controlling interest share of Endeavour Group's net assets.\n\nA gain of $6,387 million was recognised within discontinued operations for the 2022 financial period, which represented the di/fference between the net assets of Endeavour Group derecognised on transfer to shareholders (including a loan payable to the Group, which eliminated on consolidation) and the combination of (i) the non-controlling interest share of Endeavour Group's net assets, (ii) the fair value of the investment in Endeavour Group retained by the Group, and (iii) the demerger distribution liability.\n\n## Settlement of loan payable to the Group\n\nE/ffective from the separation date of 28 June 2021, Endeavour Group repaid $1,712 million of intercompany loans payable to the Group. These were funded by the $600 million bilateral bank facility and $1,900 million syndicated bank facility put in place for Endeavour Group in June 2021.\n\n## Acquisition of PFD Food Services\n\nFollowing ACCC approval on 10 June 2021, the Group completed the acquisition of a 65% equity interest in PFD Food Services Pty Ltd (PFD), resulting in the Group gaining control of PFD on 28 June 2021. In addition, PFD minority shareholders have a put option and the Group has an equivalent call option over the remaining 35% of the shares in PFD which is exercisable after three years from the acquisition date.\n\nPFD is Australia's largest privately owned foodservice network and delivers a range of dry goods, frozen and chilled products, fresh seafood and meat, confectionery, paper products, and cleaning solutions. PFD has a broad and diverse range of customers, including pubs and clubs, caf\u00e9s, airlines, hotels, restaurants, aged care and retirement villages, resorts and theme parks, convenience outlets, venue and field caterers, fast food outlets, schools and kindergartens, and sporting, child care and correctional facilities.\n\nThe investment supports the Group's Food and Everyday Needs Ecosystem strategy and is expected to unlock synergies for both businesses across the combined network and fleet. The Group will help to support PFD's growth through access to the Group's logistics, digital and data analytics, and operational capabilities. For the Group, it will enhance store range localisation and provide fleet synergies through better route and capacity optimisation across the combined network.\n\n## Consideration\n\nThe fair value of the consideration (including contingent consideration) is estimated to be $431 million, of which $324 million has been paid in cash but is subject to final working capital and net debt adjustments. The remaining balance of $107 million is the Group's estimate of the contingent consideration payable which will be based on the normalised audited financial performance of the business for the 2021 financial period or as part of an earn out in the 2023 and 2024 financial periods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The put option liability will be initially recognised at the present value of the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise within other financial liabilities with a corresponding charge directly to equity. At the acquisition date, the estimated value of the put option liability is in the range of $400 million to $450 million.\n\nIn each reporting period, the discount on the put option liability will be recognised through finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss over the period until the put option is exercised.\n\nAt each reporting period, the amount expected to be paid under the put option will be re-assessed and any changes to the estimate will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## O/ff-market buy-back\n\nOn 26 August 2021, the Group announced a capital return of $2 billion to shareholders by way of an o/ff-market buy-back of Woolworths Group Limited ordinary shares.\n\nThe buy-back will be conducted through a tender process. Eligible shareholders who choose to participate can o/ffer to sell some or all of their shares to the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 at a discount between 10% to 14% (inclusive) at 1% intervals to the market price; or\n- \u00b7 at the buy-back price, which is an election to sell shares at the price determined by the Group following completion of the tender process.\n\nThe buy-back price will be determined as the lowest price at which the Group can buy back the targeted amount of capital. The buy-back is expected to return approximately $840 million of franking credits to shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

This increased the Group's shareholding from 47% to 75%, resulting in the Group gaining control of Quantium. This transaction has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with AASB 3 Business Combinations (AASB 3), requiring the Group to recognise the fair value of Quantium's assets acquired and liabilities assumed, along with goodwill amounting to $388 million, in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position from the e/ffective date. The Group's accounting for the acquisition in the year-end financial report remains provisional.\n\nIn accordance with AASB 3, the Group's previously held equity interest of 47% has been treated as if it were disposed of and reacquired at fair value, resulting in a gain of $228 million.\n\nThe acquisition accounting for Quantium is complex and involves a high level of judgement in assessing the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest.\n\nAs part of the transaction, the Group has written a put option over the 25% non-controlling interest in Quantium. This put option has been valued at $390 million in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) and AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation (AASB 132), representing the present value of the amount expected to be paid at the expected exercise date of June 2024. The Group has classified $145 million of the put option as a current liability to reflect the maximum unavoidable payment that would be payable if the minority holders exercise their put option within 12 months.\n\nAs disclosed in Note 3.2, the put option valuation involves critical accounting estimates and judgements, specifically relating to future cash flows.\n\nDue to the complexity and judgements involved in the acquisition accounting, we determined this to be a key audit matter.\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit Matter\n\nIn conjunction with our valuation and accounting technical specialists, our procedures included but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of the key controls in respect of the accounting for and disclosure of the transaction\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the terms and conditions in the share sale agreement (SSA) and shareholders' deed\n- \u00b7 Evaluating management's accounting position paper, including the Group's conclusion that the acquisition represents a business combination in accordance with AASB/uni00A03\n- \u00b7 Challenging management's determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in particular the identification and valuation of  intangible assets acquired and the resulting deferred tax implications\n- \u00b7 Assessing the competency, qualifications, objectivity and methodologies of management's valuation experts\n- \u00b7 Assessing the fair value of the previously held equity interest\n- \u00b7 Recalculating the minority interest recognised\n- \u00b7 Assessing the Group's accounting treatment for the put option in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards. This included assessing management's calculation of the put option against the calculation methodology, time horizons and inputs stipulated in the SSA\n- \u00b7 Challenging the key assumptions used as inputs to the put option valuation, with a specific focus on forecast revenue and EBITDA, with reference to Quantium's past performance and other data sources\n- \u00b7 Evaluating  with the assistance of our treasury specialist the appropriateness of the discount rate applied to the put option liability\n- \u00b7 Assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures included in the financial report.",

        "page_content": "## Key Audit Matter\n\n## Accounting for the demerger of Endeavour Group\n\nOn 18 June 2021, the Group obtained shareholder approval for the demerger of Endeavour Group Limited (Endeavour). Endeavour was demerged from the Group on 28 June 2021, with the Group retaining a 14.6% interest. The Group will recognise a gain of $6,387/uni00A0million within discontinued operations on demerger in the 2022 financial year.  This has been disclosed as a subsequent event in Note 6.4.\n\nIn accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (AASB 5) and as disclosed in Note 1.1 the Group's F21 financial report reflects:\n\n- \u00b7 two of the Group's separate major business lines, Endeavour Drinks and Hotels, being classified as discontinued operations in the F21 and F20 Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income (and accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Refer to Note 5.2 for further details.\n- \u00b7 the carrying value of Endeavour's assets and liabilities as held for distribution in the F21 Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Refer to Note 5.3 for further details.\n\nIn addition, as disclosed in Note 4.2, a demerger distribution liability has been recognised. This reflects the fair value of the net assets of Endeavour to be distributed. The demerger distribution of $7,870/uni00A0million has been allocated between a reduction in share capital of $904 million and a demerger dividend of $6,966/uni00A0million.\n\nWe determined this to be a key audit matter due to the financial impact of the transaction on the Group.\n\n## IT systems\n\nThe IT systems across the Group are complex and there are varying levels of integration. These systems are vital to the ongoing operations of the business and to the integrity of the financial reporting process and as a result, the assessment of IT systems forms a key component of our external audit.\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit Matter\n\nIn conjunction with our accounting technical and tax specialists, our procedures included but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtaining and reviewing key demerger documents in relation to the accounting for the demerger with specific attention to:\n- -the determination of the demerger date (28 June 2021)\n- -the amount and recognition date of the demerger dividend\n- -the classification of Endeavour as held for distribution and its presentation as a discontinued operation in the F21 financial report\n- -calculation of the gain on demerger and the Group's assessment that, post demerger, significant influence in Endeavour is retained\n- -the taxation impacts of the demerger\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the Group's determination of the assets and liabilities classified as held for distribution\n- \u00b7 Assessing the completeness and accuracy of the classification of the Endeavour F21 and F20 results as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.\n- \u00b7 Performing a recalculation of the demerger distribution liability with reference to the VWAP of Endeavour shares traded on the ASX in its first five trading days and the determination of the amount recorded in share capital with reference to the ATO ruling\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the key inputs used in the calculation of the gain on demerger, being the distribution value, the fair value of the retained investment at demerger date and the carrying value of Endeavour's net assets at demerger date\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the appropriateness of disclosures in the financial report.\n\nOur procedures included but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Discussing with management the IT environment and consideration of the key financial processes to identify IT systems to include in the scope of our testing\n- \u00b7 Testing the design and implementation of the key IT controls of relevant financial reporting systems of the Group\n- \u00b7 Responding to deficiencies identified by designing and performing additional procedures which included the identification and testing of compensating controls and varying the nature, timing and extent of the substantive procedures performed.\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises the information included in the Group's Annual Report for the 52-week period ended 27 June 2021 but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Directors' Responsibilities for the Financial Report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management and the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.",

There is an obligation  on Woolworths to observe and perform its obligations under the head lease.                             |\n| Commencement  date and term | The term and further terms of each sublease align with the term and further terms under the  relevant head lease, minus one day.                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Option terms                | Where Woolworths exercises its option to renew the head lease, it must o/ffer a further term to  Endeavour. However, in circumstances where head leases include an obligation to trade as a liquor  store, Endeavour is obliged to exercise its option if Woolworths does.                         |\n| Occupancy costs             | The rent and outgoings payable are calculated according to the proportion of the area of the liquor  premises against the area of the whole premises. All occupancy costs must be paid by Endeavour  to Woolworths, with any adjustments to outgoings to be made at the end of the financial year. |\n| Amenity                     | Endeavour must not do anything that would detract from the amenity of the supermarket  premises or interfere with Woolworths' business.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Dealings                    | Endeavour must not assign, sublet or license without Woolworths' consent. Consent may  be granted or withheld at Woolworths' absolute discretion. A change in control of Endeavour  is a breach of the sublease.                                                                                   |\n| Make good obligations       | Endeavour is required to leave the liquor premises in good and tenantable repair and condition.
