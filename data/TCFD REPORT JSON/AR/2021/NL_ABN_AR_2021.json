We do this by explaining our business, strategy and financials and non-financial performance during the year, but also by providing information in the areas of risk/uni00A0and/uni00A0capital management and our governance structure - all in compliance with/uni00A0regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our annual reporting suite\n\nEvery year we publish our reporting suite, combining relevant annual disclosures on our performance for the year and other topics. Our Integrated Annual Report is our primary statutory and regulatory reporting disclosure. In/uni00A0addition, we publish other reports, including the bank's Impact Report, Pillar 3 Report, and Social Impact and Human Rights Update 2021. Though published as part of our annual reporting suite, all reports have their own individual purpose and should be read stand-alone. Anticipating upcoming regulations, we have chosen for our 2021 report, to merge our previously separate Integrated Report with our statutory Annual Report - starting the journey towards publishing a/uni00A0single truly Integrated Annual Report for ABN AMRO.\n\n## Note on basis of preparation\n\nThe Integrated Annual Report consists of the Executive Board report (chapters: Introduction, Strategy, value creation & performance, Risk, funding & capital and Leadership & governance), the Report of the Supervisory Board, the Annual Financial Statements and Other. The/uni00A0financial information in this Integrated Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). It also complies with the financial reporting requirements included in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, where applicable. In addition, ABN AMRO applies the Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework to guide\n\ncontent. Annual data relates to/uni00A0the bank's financial year, which runs from 1/uni00A0January to/uni00A031/uni00A0December. See page 370 for more information about our reporting approach, basis of/uni00A0preparation and other legal/uni00A0notices; scope and boundaries for metrics are also included in the main body/uni00A0of/uni00A0the Report, where applicable.\n\nTo download this report or obtain more information, please/uni00A0visit us at abnamro.com/annualreport or contact us/uni00A0at investorrelations@nl.abnamro.com. The definitions and/uni00A0abbreviations used in this report can be found on the/uni00A0ABN AMRO website via abnamro.com/annualreport.\n\n## European single electronic reporting format\n\nThis document is the PDF version of the Integrated Annual/uni00A0Report 2021 in the European single electronic reporting format (ESEF) and has been prepared for ease/uni00A0of/uni00A0use.

But it was also a year in which the world demonstrated resilience. Although Covid-19 is still here, it/uni00A0seems we have reached calmer waters. For the Netherlands, 2021 was a year of economic recovery and/uni00A0we/uni00A0went back to profit although we continue to experience pressure of low interest rates. The/uni00A0government continued to give businesses tailored support and the number of bankruptcies remained very low, but some sectors, such as the hospitality business, non-food retail and the travel industry, are going through a rough patch.\n\nWe have been engaging with our clients since the start of/uni00A0the pandemic, working together to look for solutions.

        "page_content": "## ' I admire how many of our clients have embraced change/uni00A0with creativity, innovation and vigour, while\n\ndealing with a situation none of us/uni00A0has ever experienced before.'\n\n## In April, ABN AMRO reached a 480 million euro settlement with the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service in connection to the anti-money laundering investigation. How do you look back on this, and what will be done about money laundering in the future?\n\nWithout any reservation, I acknowledge that in the past we/uni00A0were not sufficiently successful in properly fulfilling our important role as a gatekeeper. This is unacceptable and we have taken full responsibility for this. As a bank we do not merely have a legal, but also a moral duty to do our utmost to protect the financial system against abuse by criminals.\n\nIn 2018, we decided to centralise all AML activities and\n\nto/uni00A0remediate all identified shortcomings under a bank-wide programme, which we are working very hard to complete. We are making progress in the execution of our AML remediation programme, but the remediation is requiring more effort and we expect that the remediation will continue in/uni00A02023. We remain focused on the fight against money laundering, also by enhancing the bank's culture, one of/uni00A0my/uni00A0priorities, providing us with our licence to grow. We/uni00A0also/uni00A0carry out assessments of our speak-up principles and risk culture and raise awareness of financial crime risks.\n\nThe settlement marked the end of a painful and disappointing episode for our bank. A lot was said and written about us, understandably. I was impressed by the dedication of all my/uni00A0colleagues who - despite everything - continued to focus on our clients throughout this time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In 2021, ABN AMRO pressed ahead with the/uni00A0execution of the strategy announced in November/uni00A02020. How are you progressing?\n\nWe are well on track. At the investor update in November 2020, we set the bank's course and made some important choices. We are focusing on Northwest Europe in client segments where we have scale and where we can grow. The wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio has been largely completed, well ahead of schedule, improving our risk profile.\n\nLast year, to strengthen the execution of our strategy, we announced that we will simplify our organisational structure. As part of this, the Executive Committee ceased to exist in favour of an extended composition of the Executive Board, simplifying the banks' top management structure. Our four business lines have been replaced by three client units. This/uni00A0set-up will boost efficiency and enable us to better serve our clients by working together as one bank.\n\nA good example is our Entrepreneur & Enterprise (E&E), under which we serve entrepreneurs and their businesses as one team. This is a unique concept: we are the only bank in Northwest Europe that combines banking know-how and expertise for affluent clients and businesses in this way. By/uni00A0the end of 2021, our E&E concept was already in place in France and is currently being rolled out in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## What was the most difficult dilemma you faced in 2021? What are you least proud of?\n\nObviously, we deeply regret the fact that ABN AMRO did not sufficiently fulfil its duties as a gatekeeper. The lessons we have learned drive our continued efforts to achieve a safer society and a financial system that meets the highest standards of integrity.\n\nA dilemma or tough choice for me personally is the decision to let go of colleagues. I strongly believe in the rationale behind the wind-down of our CIB non-core portfolio. It's the right decision, but saying goodbye to colleagues who have dedicated themselves to the bank for many years is always difficult, and I can only thank them for their contribution.\n\n## 2021 was the year in which the bank laid the foundation to become a personal bank in the digital age. Where are you now?\n\nWe are making good progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. You'll never hear me say I'm satisfied - I'm always looking to see where we can improve. Being a personal bank in the digital age should result in more satisfied clients, but I realise that while we're in the process of transforming this won't always be the case. We are working hard to improve the accessibility of our Customer Care team, for instance. In the course of 2022, clients will be able to conduct all their banking business digitally.\n\nOn the other hand, we need to keep an eye on our vulnerable clients. We have doubled the number of financial coaches for clients who feel challenged by digital banking and will even increase the number of coaches to 150 during 2022. And we are looking for solutions to prevent vulnerable people and groups from being excluded from basic financial services.\n\n## ABN AMRO is known for its commitment to sustainability. Was this pushed to the background in/uni00A02021?\n\nNo, not at all. Sustainability is core to our purpose 'Banking for better, for generations to come' and is part of the regular dialogue we have with our clients. ABN AMRO firmly supports the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our biggest impact is through our lending and investment services, and we aim to increase the volume of/uni00A0our sustainability (acceleration) assets to more than a/uni00A0third of the total in 2024.\n\nSustainability is also an asset when it comes to attracting talent. Young people want to work for companies that take sustainability seriously and take action. At ABN AMRO, we are intrinsically committed to sustainability. And we have seen that for many years now, society has increasingly been focusing on how companies are dealing with ESG.\n\n## What progress is ABN AMRO making in the area of diversity and inclusion in terms of gender and/uni00A0cultural background?\n\nTo live up to our purpose, I believe we have to foster an/uni00A0inclusive climate for both our people and our clients an/uni00A0environment in which the diversity of our society is reflected. Not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's the smart thing to do. Diversity and inclusion can benefit our organisation and society as a whole. Long before I joined the bank as its CEO in 2020, I/uni00A0was personally and professionally committed to promoting/uni00A0diversity and inclusion.\n\nWe have a very ambitious diversity agenda in terms of culture and gender. We want to play an important role in the/uni00A0public debate and at the same time produce tangible results. Our commitment to building a diverse workforce in/uni00A0the Netherlands and abroad means creating a broad base and the opportunity for those who want to reach the top. We've doubled down on our efforts to achieve this lately, but we're not there yet. I personally coach people in this area and receive very valuable reverse coaching.\n\n## In February 2022, you announced a share buyback programme. Why have you decided to return the available capital to shareholders instead of using it/uni00A0for other purposes?\n\nThe choices we made in 2020 already worked out well in/uni00A02021 from a financial perspective, though the pressure on/uni00A0deposit margins due to the low interest environment remains a concern. Our fee income has shown strong growth, supporting the top line, and will grow further as our/uni00A0growth initiatives gain momentum. We remained disciplined about costs while investing in the foundation of/uni00A0our data and digital capabilities. As a public company, we/uni00A0want to remain attractive to all stakeholders, including our shareholders.\n\nAs the ECB lifted the dividend ban, we immediately paid/uni00A0out/uni00A0the 2019 final dividend in October. The share buyback programme allows us to gradually start releasing capital. We intend to use share buy backs on a regular basis/uni00A0to/uni00A0optimise our capital position, which is important to/uni00A0our shareholders.",

For instance, small businesses and Wealth Management clients are increasingly using our mobile app as we continue to add new functionalities.\n\nCurrent events in Ukraine are developing very fast. I'm\n\nextremely concerned about this conflict, which represents a/uni00A0direct assault on the principles of democracy and freedom at a scale we have not experienced in Europe since the end of the Second World War. I'm also saddened by the loss of so many innocent lives. The situation also brings economic uncertainty. We are focused on managing the implications for our clients and the bank, as well as accompanying risks. As for Covid-19, we are seeing society moving to a postpandemic new normal. It's early days yet, and the economic outlook remains uncertain, but I expect economies to continue to open up and businesses to benefit from further easing of lockdowns. At the same time, major challenges such as climate change and social inequality have intensified. Governments, NGOs and businesses need to keep working together to address these issues. I welcome the fact that all financial institutions are now engaging on ESG. It's/uni00A0important for us to work with each other for the future of the earth.\n\nA valuable insight gained during the pandemic is that\n\nworking from home has huge benefits for many colleagues, as it has the potential to improve their work-life balance. That said, all of us on the Executive Board recognise the downside for other people, who are missing a sense of connection, for colleagues who live alone and for colleagues with children, who have to juggle home schooling and work. An important job for us now is to make sure we keep our people close to the bank in whatever way possible. This is why we have regular digital updates with staff. Personally, I/uni00A0would value going into the office a bit more often because of the feeling of community it creates. Hopefully, there will be more scope for this in 2022.\n\n## Robert Swaak\n\nCEO of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ' You'll never hear\n\nme/uni00A0say I'm satisfied -I'm/uni00A0always looking to/uni00A0see where we/uni00A0can/uni00A0improve.'\n\n1",

Over the same period, the STOXX Europe 600 Bank index - our principal benchmark - gained 34%. In March 2021, our shares (depositary receipts) were transferred to the AMX (mid-cap index); they had previously been part of the AEX (the main index, which lists the Exchange's most actively traded stocks). In February 2022, ABN AMRO announced a EUR 500 million share buyback programme, to be completed by 2022. For more details,\n\nsee page 347\n\n## Dividends\n\nABN AMRO has resumed dividend payments in line with its/uni00A0dividend policy. As no interim dividend was/uni00A0paid in 2021 due to the European Central Bank's recommendation on bank dividends, ABN AMRO is now proposing a final dividend of EUR 0.61 per share, equivalent to 50% of the bank's full-year profit attributable to shareholders. This dividend proposal will be submitted for/uni00A0approval to the/uni00A02022 General Meeting of Shareholders. For 2022, ABN/uni00A0AMRO intends to re-introduce payment of an interim dividend following release of the bank's half-year 2022 results. In October 2021, ABN AMRO paid out the final dividend to shareholders for 2019 (EUR 0.68/share), following a decision by the European Central Bank not to extend its recommendation on bank dividends.

STAK AAB has issued depositary receipts representing such shares, which are listed on Euronext Amsterdam. Netherlands Financial Investments (NLFI), on behalf of the Dutch government, holds 59.7 million (6.4%) of these depositary receipts and has waived, in its capacity as holder of depositary receipts only, any meeting or voting rights attached to the depositary receipts other than the right to vote at the ABN AMRO shareholders' meeting. The remaining 469.1 million shares (49.9%) are held directly by NLFI. In 2022, NLFI will take part in the EUR 500 million share buyback as announced on/uni00A09/uni00A0February 2022 to ensure the Dutch government's total/uni00A0stake in ABN AMRO remains unchanged at 56.3%.

        "page_content": "## Our operating environment\n\nOur operating environment underwent rapid change in 2021. Economies continued to recover following the impact caused by Covid-19. At the same time, social and environmental issues gained in importance. Across the financial sector, there was a further increase in/uni00A0the/uni00A0use of data and digital technologies, accelerated by the pandemic. Furthermore, Dutch/uni00A0house prices rose sharply, driven by record low interest rates and tight housing supply.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Guide for readers\n\nIn this section, we will examine how our operating environment is changing, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic - and the latest regulatory developments affecting the banking sector.\n\n## Economic and business\n\nIn 2021, the Dutch economy began to recover from the effects of Covid-19. During the year, GDP grew by 4.8%. In/uni00A02020, the economy had contracted by/uni00A03.8%. In many sectors, economic activity was able to resume thanks to/uni00A0the roll-out of the Dutch government's vaccination programme. 1 By the end of 2021, more than 85%/uni00A0of the adult Dutch population had been vaccinated. Generally, the Dutch economy has suffered less during the/uni00A0pandemic than other similar economies thanks largely to the structure of the economy - the Netherlands is more digitalised and less reliant on tourism - and continued government support.\n\nAt the same time, the global economy also continued its rebound from the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated global GDP growth in 2021 at 5.9%, helped by rising industrial output and an increase in international trade as countries began to lift the most severe lockdown measures. The economic recovery still/uni00A0faces significant risks globally and in the Netherlands these risks relate mainly to rising energy costs, supply chain/uni00A0pressures and labour shortages in certain areas. A/uni00A0resurgence in Covid-19 infection rates - particularly if these lead to new lockdown measures - could also slow economic recovery.\n\n- 1 Source: Dutch government Coronavirus Dashboard (figures correct as at 10 February 2022)\n- 2 Dutch government support included the Temporary Emergency Bridging Measure for Work Retention (known in Dutch as NOW), Reimbursement of Fixed Costs (TVL) and the Self-Employed Income/uni00A0Support (TOZO).\n\n## Government economic support and bank lending\n\nThroughout the Covid-19 crisis, the European Central Bank has issued new money to support the eurozone economy; banks continued lending to businesses. Government financial support was also available to companies affected by the pandemic. Support measures - including wage subsidy schemes, bridging loans, tax payment deferrals and/uni00A0assistance with fixed costs 2 - were withdrawn at the/uni00A0end of September but were reinstated in November following the new restrictions. Availability of financing continued to protect businesses in 2021. In August, bankruptcies in the Netherlands reached their lowest level for twenty years, though they are likely to increase again, going into 2022, as/uni00A0the economy adjusts following the withdrawal of Dutch government support.\n\n## Consumer spending\n\nConsumers saved a lot during the Covid-19 pandemic both precautionarily, as they may have feared job losses, and involuntarily, as restrictions constrained the ability to spend. After each Covid-19 wave, when measures were phased out, we saw considerable catch up of private consumption. For 2021 as a whole, consumer spending was up 3.5%. Unemployment continued to decline in 2021 and the labour market became very tight. In the fourth quarter, for instance, 105 vacancies were available for every/uni00A0100 unemployed people. When government support is phased out in 2022, we expect unemployment to increase only very slightly, as most of the additional labour supply/uni00A0will be directly absorbed by the historically tight labour/uni00A0market.\n\n## Interest rates\n\nInterest rates remained at historically low levels, putting continued pressure on deposit margins for banks like ABN/uni00A0AMRO. This was despite signs of inflation in the economy, driven mainly by higher energy prices and supply chain disruptions, which led to shortages in certain goods. Consumer prices in the Netherlands rose by 2.7% in 2021.",

In/uni00A0many/uni00A0cases, it has accelerated trends that were already evident before the pandemic - and that are shaping the business environment for companies like ABN AMRO. For/uni00A0example, we are moving to new, more flexible ways of/uni00A0working. Issues of diversity and inclusion remain important. Meanwhile, the climate crisis has risen again to/uni00A0the top of the political agenda; during the year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its latest assessment, calling climate change 'widespread, rapid and intensifying'.\n\n## Climate change\n\nIn 2021, we saw further evidence of the worsening climate crisis. There were wildfires across Europe, Asia and the US/uni00A0Severe flooding hit western Europe, while Hurricane Ida caused an estimated USD 95 billion in economic damage along the US Atlantic coast. Increasingly, governments are adopting climate change strategies. Both the EU and the US have promised 'green recoveries', post-Covid. New regulations have also been brought forward to encourage more sustainable economic investment. For ABN AMRO, climate change remains a priority. We see opportunities in using our expertise to support clients in the/uni00A0transition to more sustainable business models.\n\n## New ways of working\n\nCovid-19 has also changed attitudes to the workplace both/uni00A0for ABN AMRO and our clients. The pandemic forced many people to work from home; that, in turn, increased the use of digital technologies. Coming out of the crisis, many employees want a more flexible approach to work. At/uni00A0the same time, Covid-19 brought renewed emphasis on/uni00A0employee health and well-being, both physical and mental. Equality issues also became more prominent, fuelled by social movements such as MeToo and Black Lives Matter. Increasingly, employees expect open, inclusive and diverse working environments.\n\n## Data and digital technology\n\nUse of data and digital continued to expand. Increasingly, banks like ABN AMRO are deploying new technologies using artificial intelligence (AI). We are also examining new opportunities in areas like blockchain technology. Across Europe, digital banking has become the norm. Online transactions rose sharply during the pandemic. Digital allows banks to work more efficiently, reduce operating costs and shorten time to market. Across the banking sector, digital and data analysis skills are now in high demand. At the same time, open banking has brought risk of disintermediation. 1 Cyber attacks, meanwhile, are on the increase, particularly through ransomware. According to the Dutch central bank, 2 cyber risks pose a major threat to financial stability. In 2021, more than half of all financial institutions worldwide reported at least one cyber attack. 3\n\n- 1 Open banking refers to the sharing of financial data between banks and authorised third/uni00A0parties via the use of Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs; Open banking gained ground following the introduction of the EU's Payment Services Directive (PSD 2).

For ABN AMRO's performance against the TLTRO target, see page 70.\n\n## ECB recommendation: dividend distributions, share buybacks and variable remuneration\n\nWith an eye on Covid-19, the ECB recommended temporary suspension of all cash dividends and share/uni00A0buybacks in March 2020. The revised ECB recommendation of December 2020 expected banks to/uni00A0exercise extreme prudence with regard to dividends and share buybacks until 30 September 2021.\n\nIn/uni00A0addition, the ECB extended its expectation to banks to adopt extreme moderation with regard to variable remuneration until 30 September 2021. A similar position was taken by the EBA, EIOPA and ESRB in order to safeguard banks' capacity to absorb losses and/uni00A0lend to support the economy. ABN AMRO's actions to reflect the supervisors' recommendations on this topic are set out in Capital in the Risk, funding/uni00A0& capital chapter and Remuneration report.\n\n## EBA requires continued application of Covid-19related reporting and disclosure requirements until further notice\n\nIn 2021, the EBA stated that uncertainty of the Covid-19 situation persists, as does the need to monitor exposures and the credit quality of loans with public support measures in Member States where these measures are still relevant. The EBA therefore continued to require application of Covid-19-related reporting and disclosure requirements, until further notice.",

These new rules are to ensure that while EU banks become more resilient to potential future economic shocks, they also continue to support Europe's post-Covid recovery and the transition to climate neutrality. The package finalises implementation of Basel III (including finalisation of/uni00A0Basel III, also known as Basel IV) taking into account the specific features of the EU banking sector. These proposed changes are expected to be implemented from 2025, after being further refined in the next two years. Particularly, the implementation of Basel III will limit banks' ability to calculate capital requirements by using internal models to ensure banks do not underestimate risks and thus are sufficiently capitalised to cover those risks. The European Commission has said the new regulations should not lead to any significant overall increase in capital requirements for EU banks.\n\n## Anti-money laundering and countering the/uni00A0finance of terrorism\n\nThe European Commission presented an ambitious package of legislative proposals to strengthen the EU's/uni00A0anti-money laundering and countering the financing/uni00A0of terrorism rules. The proposals aim, among other things, at future introduction of new rules in the areas of customer due diligence, beneficial ownership, national supervisors' powers and Financial Intelligence Units within Member States, as well as transfers of crypto assets and the establishment of a new EU supervisory authority.\n\n## Schrems II\n\nABN AMRO is implementing Schrems II. In July 2020, the European Union Court of Justice ruled that certain legal grounds for the transfer of personal data outside Europe are invalid or require supplementary measures. As a result of this ruling, ABN AMRO needs to assess the risks and monitor more actively its data transfers outside Europe. Furthermore, ABN AMRO may need to/uni00A0take extra measures regarding non-EU vendors, or/uni00A0in/uni00A0some cases stop the data transfer.\n\n## Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM)\n\nThe ECB's Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM)/uni00A0ended in 2021. The review aimed at ensuring consistency in capital requirements across the eurozone. For more information, see Capital in the/uni00A0Risk,/uni00A0funding & capital chapter.\n\n## EBA Guidelines on internal governance and Guidelines on sound remuneration policies\n\nThe European Banking Authority published its revised Guidelines on internal governance and Guidelines on/uni00A0sound remuneration policies along with the ECB/uni00A0fit/uni00A0and proper guidance. The revised Guidelines depict/uni00A0the amendments introduced by the fifth Capital/uni00A0Requirements Directive (CRD V) and the Investment Firms Directive (IFD) in relation to credit/uni00A0institutions' sound and effective governance, suitability and remuneration arrangements, in particular with regard/uni00A0to/uni00A0gender diversity, money laundering and/uni00A0the/uni00A0management of conflicts of interest.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

Such reporting aims to prevent greenwashing and help companies to/uni00A0become more climate-friendly. The EU Taxonomy Regulation covers six environmental objectives. Two of/uni00A0them have already been published (climate change mitigation and adaptation); the remaining four are expected in 2022. Recently, the EC drafted delegated acts on the inclusion of Nuclear energy and Gas in the/uni00A0EU's taxonomy. The documents are subject to a scrutiny period (4-6 months) during which the European Parliament and the Council can either approve or object. If both parties will approve, the acts will enter into force on the 1st of January 2023.\n\n## EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\n\nThe SFDR came into effect in March 2021 and applies directly to ABN AMRO's investment business. SFDR lays down harmonised rules for financial market participants and financial advisors on transparency with/uni00A0regard to the integration of sustainability risks and/uni00A0the consideration of adverse sustainability impacts in their processes and the provision of sustainabilityrelated information with respect to financial products. The European Commission is expected to supplement the SFDR with Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) to/uni00A0specify the details of the content and presentation of/uni00A0the information to be disclosed. The application of/uni00A0the/uni00A0RTS has been delayed until January 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MiFID II ESG\n\nFollowing publication of the Commission's Action Plan, the MiFID II Delegated Regulation was updated in 2021 to integrate sustainability factors, risk and preferences into certain organisational requirements and operating conditions for investment firms. Furthermore, the Commission introduced amendments to the MiFID/uni00A0II Delegated Directive to integrate sustainability factors into the product governance obligations. The Regulation is expected to come into force in the course of 2022.\n\n## EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n\nThe EU is introducing a new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), that extends mandatory sustainability reporting to all large companies and listed SMEs. It also requires companies to obtain independent assurance of their sustainability disclosures. ABN AMRO already reports under the current Non-Financial Reporting Directive and aims to fully comply with the CSRD when it enters into force. Many of our corporate clients will need to comply with the CSRD as well.\n\n## ECB guide on climate risks\n\nThe ECB released a guide on climate-related and environmental risks (CER) that outlines the ECB's understanding of the safe and prudent management of/uni00A0these risks under the current prudential regulatory framework. The guide describes how the ECB expects institutions to consider CER in their business strategy and governance and risk management frameworks and serves as a basis for a supervisory dialogue between the ECB and institutions such as ABN AMRO.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As/uni00A0part of its Digital Finance Strategy, the EU is introducing a Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which is/uni00A0designed to strengthen banks' management of/uni00A0cybersecurity risks and is expected to come into force in 2022.

A final dividend of/uni00A0EUR 0.68 per share was paid in October, and/uni00A0did not affect the bank's capital ratios.\n\n## Simplified organisational structure and top management\n\nABN AMRO announced it would simplify its internal organisation to better serve clients - at the beginning of 2022, the bank's four business lines were replaced by three client units: Personal & Business Banking, Wealth Management and Corporate Banking. The existing Executive Committee (ExCo) was replaced by an extended Executive Board (ExBo), simplifying the bank's top management structure.\n\nFollowing the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on/uni00A024 November 2021 we welcomed Choy van der Hooft-Cheong as Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) Wealth Management and Dan Dorner as CCO Corporate Banking. Gerard Penning remains our Chief/uni00A0Human Resources Officer. 1 During the year, however, we have also said goodbye to several Executive Committee and Executive Board members/uni00A0- Clifford Abrahams, Daphne de Kluis, Rutger van Nouhuijs and Pieter van Mierlo decided to/uni00A0pursue their careers outside ABN/uni00A0AMRO.

We have set clear 'sustainability acceleration' targets (see table on page 35). In 2021, we raised up these targets to reflect significant demand for sustainable financing and investments.

These 27 fundamentals are not directly linked to/uni00A0our strategic KPIs.\n\nThe 'Strategy, value creation & performance' chapter is/uni00A0therefore focused on the progress of the strategic\n\n## Strategic differentiators\n\n## Page\n\n## Strategic pillars\n\n- Customer experience\n- Digitalisation\n\n45-47\n\n45-47 & 58-63\n\n- Clear and appropriate advice\n\n45-47\n\n- Responsible investment and financing\n- Circular economy\n- Diversity and equal opportunity\n- Viable business model\n- Risk profile/management\n- Financial performance\n- 1 For full results of this assessment, please see page 372.\n\n49-53\n\n53\n\n54-56\n\n58-63\n\n58-63 & 83-202\n\n66-79 & 261-367\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customer experience\n\nA personal bank in the digital age for the resourceful and ambitious\n\n## Sustainability\n\nDistinctive expertise in supporting clients' transition to sustainability\n\n## Future-proof bank\n\nEnhance customer service, compliance and efficiency\n\ndifferentiators, whereas the fundamentals are discussed throughout the report.\n\nPlease note that we do not have strategic KPIs in place for/uni00A0all strategic differentiators.

These standards contain clear definitions with regard to clients' sustainability policies, practice and governance. The overall target for sustainability (acceleration) asset volume is calculated as the sum of sustainability (acceleration) asset volume (mortgages and corporate loans) and sustainability (acceleration) client asset volume, divided by the sum of the outstanding mortgage loan book, corporate loan book and relevant client asset volume.\n- 2 The intensified focus on ESG, including regulation, resulted in an increase of our sustainability targets towards 2024.\n- 3 We have aligned our definition of sustainable client assets with the definitions set in the EU SFDR regulation and therefore have changed the terminology used to ESG and Impact/uni00A0investments. 2020 figures have not been retrospectively adjusted for this change.

We can create value in various ways - by lending to companies, for/uni00A0example, we/uni00A0support economic growth and job creation.\n\nWe also provide mortgages so that clients can experience the benefits of home ownership. For our employees, we offer salaries and benefits, career opportunities and a safe working environment. At the same time, we are aware that, like any business, our activities may also cause harm. By financing growth, we are also indirectly damaging the/uni00A0environment through carbon emissions, pollution or/uni00A0consumption of scarce natural resources. We work to/uni00A0minimise these negative effects - by applying strict rules for lending and investment activities, and increasing funding for sustainable business.\n\n## Defining our stakeholders\n\nOur stakeholders are defined as: 'any group or individual the bank affects through its activities or products and services or who, in turn, may affect the bank's ability to/uni00A0achieve its goals'. Using this definition, we recognise four/uni00A0main stakeholder groups: clients, employees, investors and society. We regularly consult stakeholders - and incorporate their views, where possible, into our decisions, strategy and reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Examples of stakeholders\n\nClients\n\nRetail Banking clients (including individuals and SMEs); Commercial Banking clients; Corporate & Institutional Banking clients; Private Banking clients; public sector clients; brokers, intermediaries and/uni00A0other distributors.\n\nEmployees\n\nFull-time and part-time employees, subcontractors\n\nInvestors\n\nShareholders, bondholders\n\nSociety\n\nSuppliers and external consultants; other business partners; local communities; governments and regulators; NGOs\n\n## Our value creation model\n\nOur value creation model summarises ABN AMRO's value/uni00A0creation process; the model uses the Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework's six capitals. During the value/uni00A0creation process, these capitals may either increase or decrease as/uni00A0a consequence of the bank's activities. Much of the value we create is financial in nature, but/uni00A0it/uni00A0may also be social or environmental. The six <IR> capitals - manufactured, financial, intellectual, human, social and natural - reflect these different types of value. 1\n\nOur model comprises four sections, and should be read from left to right:\n\n- \u00c5 Inputs: These are the resources (or capitals) we/uni00A0need to operate our business, ranging from the time, skills and know-how of our employees to the equity provided by investors.\n- \u00c5 Business activities: This is our 'engine room'; it/uni00A0shows, in effect, what we do with inputs to/uni00A0create value for stakeholders.\n- \u00c5 Outputs: These show the immediate results of our activities - the salaries we pay our employees, for example, or mortgages granted to clients.\n- \u00c5 Outcomes: These refer to the results of our outputs - our products, for example, help clients save and invest; mortgages, meanwhile, provide greater social security.\n- 1 For more information, see page 375.\n\n1",

For example through mortgage lending, which gives clients access to home ownership. In the case of the Dutch housing market, this is an asset that increases in value for clients. We also create value through our extended loans and advances to support businesses and job creation. We measure our value for specific focus segments through our Net Promoter Score.\n\n## Net Promoter Score\n\n- \u00c5 -1 NPS Mortgages\n- \u00c5 -33 NPS SMEs\n\nIn exchange for our services - our manufactured capital - clients and counterparties transferred considerable financial capital to ABN AMRO by paying interest on loans or mortgages and paying transaction fees. Value created for investors rose sharply, mainly driven by an increase in/uni00A0ABN AMRO's share price and a rebound in the bank's net profit for the year.\n\n- \u00c5 EUR 1.21 earnings per share\n- \u00c5 6% return on equity\n- \u00c5 16% CET 1 ratio (Basel IV)\n\n- \u00c5 EUR 5.3 billion absolute cost base 2\n- \u00c5 -7bps cost of risk\n\nWe created intellectual value for clients by providing advice, by investing in innovation & technology and/uni00A0by maintaining the stability and reliability of the our banking payment system. We/uni00A0also received intellectual capital from others, including suppliers and business partners. At/uni00A0the same time, there were/uni00A0adverse effects, for instance resulting from cybercrime incidents.\n\n- \u00c5 125 client complaints relating to data privacy breaches (1 substantiated)\n- \u00c5 83 total client complaints relating to breaches of other regulatory or voluntary codes in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Netherlands (4 substantiated)\n\nThroughout the year, Covid-19 continued to deplete value, affecting our employees' occupational health and/uni00A0safety. At the same time, we created value by providing desks and other equipment to/uni00A0improve home working. In 2021 our workforce grew, creating more value through contributed time, skills and knowledge. In return, we created value for our employees through salaries and/uni00A0benefits. In addition to skill development, we also focused on attracting and retaining talent by offering our employees reskilling and upskilling.\n\n- \u00c5 82% employee engagement score\n- \u00c5 4,214 new hires in 2021, of which 2,412 were internal hires\n\nOur social capital is impacted significantly by our relationships. We have reduced our value creation as reflected in a lower NPS for Retail Banking and a decrease in ABN AMRO's brand value. We created value in 2021 by further reducing financial distress due to difficulties in repaying loans. However, we depleted social value through discrimination, underpayment and child labour in ABN AMRO's value chains.\n\n- \u00c5 30% D&I at subtop\n- \u00c5 Net Promoter Score (NPS) 2021\n- \u00c5 -18 Retail Banking\n- \u00c5 +14 Private Banking\n- \u00c5 +1 Commercial Banking\n- \u00c5 +37 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\nWe are aware that, like any business, our activities may also cause harm. By financing growth and through our own operations, we are also indirectly damaging the environment. In 2021 we continued to/uni00A0reduce our impact on the environment and use of natural resources, largely as a result of further winding down our C&IB non-core activities. In addition to offsetting our own operations emissions, we worked to/uni00A0further minimise our negative impact through, among other things, circular transactions and sustainable products. This impact is measured through our sustainability (acceleration) asset volume KPI.\n\n- \u00c5 53 kTon of carbon emissions from own operations 1\n- \u00c5 26.2 million tonnes of carbon emitted as a result of the bank's lending and investment activities 1\n\n1",

Over the past year, ABN AMRO has continued its move towards more digital banking and extended video banking. At the same time, we/uni00A0recognise that more work is needed to improve our NPS, our main measure of customer experience, particularly for our two target areas: SMEs and mortgages.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Guide for readers\n\nIn this section we will examine the progress we are making with the first of our strategic pillars: customer experience. Our text looks at/uni00A0both how/uni00A0we're improving our offering to clients and/uni00A0the/uni00A0internal factors driving these changes. We/uni00A0will be covering three of our strategic differentiators: customer experience, digitalisation, and clear and appropriate advice.\n\n## Convenience & expertise\n\nWe offer both convenience and expertise: fully digital selfservice through end-to-end digitalisation for a convenient daily banking experience, and tailored solutions, based on sector-specific, financial and sustainability expertise.\n\nOver the past year, we have continued to expand digital banking. We added Google Pay to the ABN AMRO banking app. We/uni00A0completed our repositioning of Moneyou as a provider of online, price-competitive mortgages. Meanwhile, we are/uni00A0also extending video banking, which has increased in popularity during the pandemic. In recent years, Tikkie our/uni00A0payments app - has become a regular feature of daily life for many of our clients. More than 100/uni00A0million transactions were made through Tikkie in 2021, worth more than EUR/uni00A04.2 billion.\n\nWe also introduced Aymz, a new digital lending platform for/uni00A0SMEs, and extended our automatic bookkeeping service. In 2021, we launched Snel Betaald - or 'Quick Payment', which allows small businesses to be credited for/uni00A0amounts just 24/uni00A0hours after they are invoiced.\n\nAs the use of digital services has become the preferred channel for many clients and more services become available digitally, our clients are no longer visiting our branches as often as they used to. Following client behaviour, we continued to rightsize our branch network. We closed a further 35 branches in 2021 1 , leaving 77 branches across the country. At the same time we are making sure clients are still able to access the services they need. Currently, we are working to expand the use of digital signatures providing handwritten signatures is one of/uni00A0the/uni00A0main reasons clients still visit our/uni00A0branches.\n\n## Chatbot Anna\n\nBy the end of 2021, Chatbot Anna - our digital helper was handling around half of all live chat requests we receive. The chatbot is powered by AI, so it learns as it responds to requests. In 2021, we also made Chatbot Anna available on our mobile app. First launched in 2018, the chatbot speeds up processes for clients, and saves us time and resources, enabling our advisors to focus on/uni00A0expertise. Among clients, Chatbot Anna is one of/uni00A0our/uni00A0highest-rating services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Marketshare growth in focus segments\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlongside convenience, we realise clients also need expertise - clear and appropriate advice - particularly at important moments in their lives. We provide advice through our financial coaches, tailored solutions, our sector specialists, or personal interaction using video banking. By/uni00A0the end of 2021, 96% of our retail clients meetings were already held using video banking, a highly rated service by our clients and resulting in more client contact - while increasing efficiency. For our SME clients, this was 75%. Video banking allows clients to speak to their bankers, even outside usual working hours and it is a highly rated service to provide advice and expertise. In 2021, the large majority of our mortgages were arranged through video banking.\n\nOur market share in mortgages expanded during the year to 16%, up from 14% in 2020; we are making good progress towards our 20% target in 2024. Our market share for SME clients remained at 18% in/uni00A02021, in line with our expectation towards our 20% target in 2024.\n\nFor corporate clients, we have a full service offering in all sectors in the Netherlands. In Northwest Europe we focus on chosen sectors where we already have established expertise, including real estate, shipping, energy, financial institutions. Sustainability is an important cornerstone in our/uni00A0offering (see our feature on page 48).\n\nWe are also rolling out our Entrepreneur & Enterprise (E&E) concept, under which we serve entrepreneurs and their businesses as one team and seamlessly combining services for clients with both commercial and private banking needs. By the end of 2021, our E&E concept was already in place in France and is currently being rolled out in/uni00A0the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.\n\n## Partners and intermediaries\n\nIn 2021, we continued to work with outside partners. In many cases, this allowed us to develop new 'Beyond Banking' services for clients. In partnership with PayDay, for example, we launched a new, instant payment service for workers in/uni00A0the gig economy. We are working with BRIX to help firsttime house buyers - and with MySafe, which offers secure data storage. Through partnerships with HomeQgo and\n\nde/uni00A0Energie bespaarders ('the energy savers'), we advise to clients on how to make their homes more sustainable and save on energy bills. Partnerships are important to increasing our/uni00A0market share, particularly in our two strategic focus areas: mortgages and SMEs. In 2021, we were chosen by/uni00A0Dutch/uni00A0intermediaries as the best mortgage provider in the/uni00A0Netherlands in terms of improving home sustainability, combining expert advice with fast and convenient service. In addition, through our partnerships, we are strengthening our position in the growing platform economy (see page 58). We also work with others in areas where banking services are becoming more commoditised - our cash machines, for/uni00A0example, have been replaced by/uni00A0Geldmaat ATMs as part of a joint venture with ING and/uni00A0Rabobank.\n\nAlso for our SME clients we are continuously looking to expand our (advisory) services. We are accelerating with Impact Nation - a partnership enabling us to link clients with specific sustainability issues with other businesses which know exactly how to handle these issues. We are also keen on further developing existing propositions, releasing new features. For example in our bookkeeping proposition, where we have introduced a new feature in the ABN AMRO's bookkeeping connector - connecting an external bookkeeping program with the client's banking apps.\n\n## Customer loyalty\n\nTo measure progress with customer experience, ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses the Net Promoter Score, or NPS. In 2021, our aim was/uni00A0to maintain NPS scores at their 2020 levels. Closing of/uni00A0branches and negative interest affected client relations, while businesses could apply for financial support from the/uni00A0government, and relied less on their banks for financing. Overall, we are working to improve NPS across the bank by continuing to provide convenience and expertise.\n\nWe measure NPS by business line, market and client profile. As part of our strategy, we have set targets for relational NPS (rNPS) for both mortgages and SMEs. Across our businesses, we take a 'first-time-right' approach to client relations - ensuring quick, flawless service. We realise that NPS, particularly for business banking, is driven by regular, personal contact between clients and our bankers.\n\n## NPS performance\n\n- \u00c5 Retail Banking: Despite declining for the full year, the/uni00A0NPS for Retail Banking improved in the second half/uni00A0of the year. Surveys showed clients appreciated the/uni00A0convenience of digital banking. However,/uni00A0scores were affected by clients being charged negative interest rates, increasing costs for payment packages, and a/uni00A0decreased availability via/uni00A0branches, ATMs or by telephone. We are working on/uni00A0making it easier for clients to contact their advisors. Relational NPS for mortgages one of our/uni00A0strategic focus areas - remained unchanged, year-on-year, and close to our 2024 target despite the wider decrease in/uni00A0our Retail Banking NPS.",

Like other banks, ABN AMRO has felt obliged to pass on these rates to clients. In doing so, we have done our best to protect as many clients as/uni00A0possible. From the beginning of 2022, negative rates will be charged on accounts with a combined balance of EUR 100,000 or more. This threshold, previously set at EUR 150,000, applies to both retail and business clients. At this amount, only around 5% of our clients will have to pay negative interest.\n\n## Revolving consumer credits\n\nDuring the year, ABN AMRO reached an agreement with the Dutch Consumers' Association for clients whose floating rate on their consumer credit did not/uni00A0sufficiently follow the market rate. Under the deal, ABN/uni00A0AMRO agreed to compensate all clients affected from 2008/uni00A0onwards. Subsequently, the bank has decided proactively to compensate clients affected prior to/uni00A0that date (from 2001 onwards), where there is/uni00A0sufficient information to do so. As/uni00A0a/uni00A0result, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has increased its provision Over 15% of all clients with a revolving credit facility\n\nto/uni00A0cover the/uni00A0cost of the/uni00A0agreement to EUR 340 million (up from/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0250 million previously).

Managing/uni00A0Director Richard Brandwijk tells us how financing from ABN AMRO is/uni00A0supporting his company's drive to sustainability.\n\n'Two years ago, we made the decision to reduce our carbon emissions. Energy consumption was our biggest issue, with our factory using around 1.5 million kilowatt hours of energy per year. That's enough to power 600 homes. So we set up a team to examine our environmental impact and find remedies. ABN AMRO helped finance this with a transition loan. It was a pilot scheme and a steep learning curve. The basic terms were straightforward enough - that our interest rate would be lowered if we cut carbon emissions by 10% in three years and that we would pay more if we didn't.'\n\n'Finding a way of comparing year-on-year emissions accurately was tough. The formula we used had to factor in business growth. The carbon footprint of a business that is expanding will naturally increase, and we wanted our targets to take that into account. In the end, together with ABN AMRO, we agreed that measuring carbon intensity against annual turnover was the fairest way.'\n\n'The financing from ABN AMRO gave us a real incentive we started by attacking some obvious issues, from making sure coffee machines are turned off to timing the airconditioning to shut down when the factory alarms are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nswitched on. But we also focused on larger impacts. We/uni00A0have an air compressor, for example, that generates excess heat, so we doubled up by moving it to a part of the/uni00A0building that needed to be kept warm. Or optimising the/uni00A0use of machines that dry material over the weekend in/uni00A0preparation for work on Mondays. One dryer consumes the/uni00A0same amount of energy each day as two households do.'\n\n'At the same time, we're talking to our own clients about what they can do to help. Aircraft manufacturers insist we make components with new raw materials when, for nonstructural parts, we could use recycled materials instead. We are trying to set up a project with customers to see if/uni00A0we can do that. Aerospace businesses also use highly engineered plastics that take a lot of energy to produce. We/uni00A0believe about 30% of those products could be made with lower grade materials needing half as much energy to make.'\n\n'ABN AMRO also invited me to one of their workshops and/uni00A0that really helped open my eyes. A couple of our new initiatives came out of that. It's great to know that the bank is really thinking and working with you on these issues.'",

To support this transition, we are expanding financing for sustainability, and increasingly incorporating sustainability risk - including climate risk - into our approach to lending and investment services. Within sustainability, we have three main focus areas: climate change, circular economy and social impact. This section is/uni00A0organised in line with these areas. In/uni00A02021 we saw the focus on ESG intensifying, including regulation; in response, we have revised our targets on Sustainability (acceleration) asset volumes, see page 35\n\n## Sustainability (acceleration) asset volumes\n\n|                                                         | 2021 target   | 2021 results   | 2020 results   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| ESG + impact investments                                | 26%           | 38%            | 22%            |\n| Mortgages                                               | 22%           | 25%            | 23%            |\n| CIB (core) loans                                        | 12%           | 13%            | 9%             |\n| CB loans                                                | 11%           | 15%            | 13%            |\n| Total sustainability (acceleration) asset target volume | 21%           | 27%            | 20%            |\n\nIn 2021 the sustainable (acceleration) volume increased compared to 2020. The increase in ESG +impact investments is partly caused by the change of definitions due to the SFDR, which came into effect in March 2021. Also positive market performance of ESG + impact securities and an increase in new contracts explain part of the increase. The mortgage volume increase is due to a relatively higher inflow and lower outflow of energy labels A or higher compared to the lower label categories. The increase in corporate loans at CB and CIB core is due to strong lending performance during the year and an increased interest in sustainability-linked loans from clients.\n\nMore details can be found on page 51-52 and definitions can be found on page 376. We have aligned our definition of sustainable client assets with the definitions set in the EU SFDR regulation and therefore have changed the terminology used to ESG and Impact investments. 2020 figures have not been retrospectively adjusted for this change given the SFDR came into effect in March 2021.\n\n## Note on Green Asset Ratio\n\nThe EU Taxonomy's objective is to provide users of the bank's financial statements with a common basis for identifying business activities as environmentally sustainable. To qualify as 'environmentally sustainable', and/uni00A0to/uni00A0therefore be included in the Green Asset Ratio (GAR), economic activities must significantly contribute to/uni00A0a/uni00A0taxonomy objective, meet the 'do no significant harm' (DNSH) criteria and meet minimum safeguards criteria.\n\nWe plan to disclose the GAR in our 2023 Annual Report. We/uni00A0are only permitted to include the taxonomy-aligned exposures relating to corporates bound by the EU's current Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD),\n\ncertain/uni00A0household exposures and specific local government financing in the ratio. This means that a/uni00A0significant part of/uni00A0our portfolio (such as lending to, and/uni00A0investments in, non-NFRD corporates and financial institutions amounting to 30.1% of our total assets) cannot be considered for taxonomy alignment and will subsequently be excluded from the GAR in our 2023 Annual Report. In future, we will align our definitions for/uni00A0sustainable acceleration loans as far as possible with/uni00A0the EU Taxonomy definitions. However, we also see a/uni00A0need for additional sustainability-related metrics to cover clients and exposures - notably our SME portfolio - that cannot be directly included in the GAR from a regulatory point of view.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Climate\n\nWe are currently developing a Climate Strategy to increase\n\nABN AMRO's efforts related to the objectives set out in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. As part of this strategy, we intend to steer the bank towards a maximum +1.5\u02daC global warming target. We expect this Climate Strategy to be finalised during 2022. To achieve our goals, we are reducing our exposure to fossil fuels, encouraging clients to invest more sustainably and offering sustainability and transition loans to businesses, our mortgage clients and other consumers. We want to become net-zero by 2050; we're supporting our corporate clients in that same transition. The/uni00A0Dutch government's policies will help support ABN/uni00A0AMRO's approach in this area. The Netherlands' target is to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to less than half of their 1990 levels, and to eliminate emissions altogether by mid-century. Over the past year, ABN AMRO has again been active in international efforts to/uni00A0tackle climate change; the bank is a founding member of/uni00A0both PCAF and the Poseidon Principles, which seek to/uni00A0reduce emissions from global shipping. We have also committed to implementing recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 1\n\nIn 2021, our combined emissions from our own operations amounted to 53 kTon, an increase compared to 2020 following a methodology change. 2 Scope 3 emissions - those from our lending and investment activities - totalled 26.2 million tonnes, down 36% from 2020, also impacted by the wind-down of our non-core Corporate & Institutional Banking operations. 3 In 2021, our rating from the CDP - formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project - declined from A- to B.\n\nIn addition to our leading by example activities on climate, we are also helping clients make the transition to sustainability. We have described this on the following two pages.\n\n' As part of this strategy, we intend to steer the bank towards a maximum +1.5\u02daC global warming target. We/uni00A0expect this/uni00A0Climate Strategy to be finalised during 2022.'\n\n- 1 We report annually against the TCFD recommendations; which are incorporated throughout this report.\n- 2 ABN AMRO's carbon emissions cover both scopes 1 and 2, and scope 3 emissions relating to home workplace, air travel, international business rail travel, hotel visits, mobility, public transport and IT. In 2020 we only included air travel, leading to an expanded scope and increase in emissions in 2021. We compensate all of our Tank-to-Wheel carbon emissions resulting from business travel, mobility, office and home locations and IT, by investing in VCS verified carbon emission reduction projects.\n- 3 During 2021, we have changed the methodology for the calculation of scope 3 emissions of our lending activities. As a result, our 2020 scope 3 emissions have been restated from 32.4 million tonnes to 41.2 million tonnes. More information on this and the impact by the wind-down of our non-core operations, see section GHG measuring and steering on page 175.\n- 4 In addition to those mentioned here, we also support other sustainability initiatives, including: Accounting for Sustainability (A4S), Dutch Climate Accord (for the financial services sector), the Getting to Zero Coalition, the Poseidon Principles, the Science-Based Targets initiative, the Spitsbergen ambition, and the UN Principles for both Responsible Banking and Responsible Investment.\n\n## Our international commitments\n\nTo support our approach in this area, we are signatories to/uni00A0a/uni00A0series of international initiatives, allowing us to/uni00A0work together with other stakeholders to tackle important social and environmental challenges. These initiatives include the Equator Principles on responsible project finance, and the Principles for both Responsible Banking and Responsible Investment. We have been a/uni00A0member of the UN Global Compact for 17 years. In/uni00A02021, we joined Banking for Impact to help develop global standards for social and environmental impact reporting. We also signed up to the Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF), modelled on/uni00A0Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) - biodiversity, we believe, is an issue of growing importance for the financial sector. 4 Moreover, biodiversity has become an increasingly important topic for ABN AMRO, as many of our clients depend on the natural world. We realise that, through our lending and investment services, we are having an impact on biodiversity. Later this year we will publish a/uni00A0special publication on biodiversity. In/uni00A0addition, we also closely monitor our rating in the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), widely regarded as the most reliable external assessment of performance in this area. In/uni00A02021, five points were deducted from our DJSI/uni00A0score to reflect the recent anti-money laundering investigation; as a/uni00A0result, we fell short of our target to/uni00A0appear in the top 5% of DJSI-rated companies.\n\n## Sustainable Impact Fund\n\nTo support our clients in the energy transition, we have created a new Sustainable Impact Fund (SIF); this fund will make investments of up to EUR 30 million in companies with a proven sustainable business model or concept. The fund will concentrate on three main themes: the circular economy, energy transition and social impact (in line with our sustainability strategic pillar). The first investments have already been made: in Envision (which makes smart glasses for the visually impaired), Foodlogica (which provides logistics for refrigerated food), and Innax (a Dutch company that advises clients and offers solutions for improving the sustainability/energy efficiency of buildings). ABN/uni00A0AMRO has committed a total of EUR 425 million to the/uni00A0fund, of which we have invested EUR/uni00A0175/uni00A0million to/uni00A0date; the SIF incorporates the bank's previous Energy Transition and Social Impact Funds.",

In 2021 this was 30%.\n- \u00c5 Continue to assess all corporate loans for environmental risk, and screen out activities harmful to the climate (for example arctic drilling, shale gas, tar sands, new coal-fired power plants).\n- \u00c5 We offer sustainability-linked loans to incentivise clients to improve their sustainability performance by/uni00A0linking the interest rate to sustainability KPIs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are engaging with our shipping clients to make their vessels more sustainable compared with the IMO emission reduction trajectory through the Poseidon Principles. On 31 December 2021, 33% of the shipping portfolio had a GHG label of A or B and we aim to increase this to 40% by 2024.\n\nABN AMRO has structurally embedded the dialogue with clients on sustainability-related topics, supported by the Client Assessment on Sustainability (CASY) tool./uni00A0We are in regular dialogue with clients on their sustainability performance and how our dedicated sustainability advisory team and sustainable finance desk can support them. For our SME clients, for example, our/uni00A0internal network of 80 or so relationship managers specifically trained on climate-related topics assist clients in their sustainability transition. And so does our/uni00A0Subsidy expertise desk - helping our clients identify relevant sustainability subsidies for their business.\n\nIn 2021 we set up a new proposition 'Sustainability client advisory' for our corporate clients in which we share our knowledge with clients with regard to disclosure and upcoming regulations that are applicable to them (NFRD, TCFD, EU Taxonomy, etc). Our frontoffice colleagues have received further sustainability training for relationship managers to support clients in their transition to more sustainable business models.\n\n## Investment services\n\nIncrease clients' investments in ESG and sustainable funds and strategies by:\n\n- \u00c5 Offering ESG investing as the 'default option' for/uni00A0clients across all Private Banking operations.\n- \u00c5 Increasing our ESG and sustainable offering, also in/uni00A0smaller asset classes like structured products.\n- \u00c5 Reporting the impact of investments to clients in Advisory and DPM mandates on carbon emissions and other ESG factors to track alignment with the/uni00A0Paris objectives and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nAs part of our investment process in the Advice and DPM mandates, we regularly discuss sustainability. For/uni00A0execution-only clients this is still difficult as they are/uni00A0not in touch with one of our advisors and therefore need to look into the sustainability of their investments themselves. Improving our service in the execution-only segment in matters relating to sustainability will be one of our focus areas for the future.\n\nSince 2020, we have been working with EOS at Federated Hermes in a proxy engagement programme allowing us to engage with more companies, on a larger scale, and in a more proactive way. This engagement programme provides an effective foundation for our increased focus on ESG Due Diligence. It enables engagement with listed companies about ESG issues, focusing on twelve themes ranging from the environment and circular enterprise to risk management and working conditions. An extensive reporting suite that includes regular case studies is then made available, giving ABN AMRO more/uni00A0clarity about the progress companies are making.\n\nIn 2021, EOS at Federated Hermes engaged on ESG issues with 845 companies that we are invested in on/uni00A0behalf of our clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

At the same time, we continued to make progress on it - for both residential and commercial real estate. In time, we expect to replace our 2030 objectives with targets based on carbon emissions (per m 2 ), more in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and the EU's new sustainable finance standards.\n\n## Commercial real estate\n\nWe support our clients through renovations, increased use of glazing, solar, LED lighting etc. and by applying stricter environmental standards to the properties we/uni00A0finance.\n\n## Residential real estate\n\nWe help improve the energy efficiency of the homes we finance by promoting sustainability measures such as insulation and solar panels. We have also introduced an online Energy Savings Check to help homeowners identify and carry out energy-saving measures. Meanwhile, we/uni00A0have increased our sustainability discount. 1\n\nOur Advice Policy states that in their meetings with clients, our advisors must always discuss additional financing options for making their homes more sustainable. To this end, we have added two standard questions on sustainability in the onboarding procedure for clients applying for a new mortgage and have by default included sustainability considerations in the advice report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more progress on our Mission 2030 programme, see our sustainability (acceleration) asset volume on page 49.

        "page_content": "## Social impact\n\nSocial issues gained in prominence during the pandemic. For ABN AMRO, it is important that everyone has access to/uni00A0the financial system, including those who have financial worries, disabilities, or experience face discrimination. To/uni00A0do/uni00A0this, we play our part in supporting the most vulnerable in society.\n\nIn our approach to social impact, we have three main priorities - equal opportunities, financial resilience and financial inclusion. Below are a few examples from the wide range of initiatives ABN AMRO undertakes to support the most vulnerable in society:\n\n- \u00c5 We provide financial coaches to senior citizens and clients with disabilities to ensure they continue to have access to banking services, particularly with the growth in digitalisation. As part of this, we work closely with Dutch national senior citizens' associations. In December 2021, we announced that we would be doubling the number of financial coaches - from 30 to 60 and aim to/uni00A0increase this to 150 in 2022.\n- \u00c5 We are also working to tackle issues such as fair pay and/uni00A0poor working conditions among vulnerable migrant workers in the Netherlands. Since March 2021, we expect labour agencies that want to become a client to be certified by at least the Stichting Normering Arbeid (SNA), and by the Stichting Normering Flexwonen (SNF) if they provide housing to migrant workers. Despite SNA/uni00A0and SNF being proper certificates, we are also strengthening other elements of our client and credit acceptance due diligence procedures to cover the entire spectrum of issues that are relevant to this matter. 1\n- \u00c5 Under equal opportunities, we have our 'Banking through the gender lens' programme - backed up by an Inclusive Banking team - to help break down current, often unconscious barriers to financing faced by various client groups, such as women entrepreneurs and young entrepreneurs. In 2021, we also became the first Dutch bank to join the Financial Alliance for Women.\n- 1 In line with the recommendations of the Geen tweederangsburgers report by/uni00A0the/uni00A0Aanjaagteam bescherming arbeidsmigranten, which is available online.\n- \u00c5 We promote financial resilience through awareness, education and coaching programmes as well as online tools for people to check their vulnerability, and we offer follow-up support through 150 fulltime budget coaches. Preventing financial difficulties is key in this approach. Special attention is also given to young clients (see our feature on page 57 ).\n\nThrough ABN AMRO Foundation, we promote volunteering among our employees, and fund charities and good causes, including the Young Education Fund and the Krajicek Foundation, which helps disadvantaged children take up sports. During 2021, we made a community investment of/uni00A0nearly EUR 1 million through this foundation.\n\nAnd with our Time to Catch Up programme (De Inhaalslag), we aim to create more equal opportunities for men and/uni00A0women in field hockey. One of the elements of this programme is that we require the 50 or so hockey clubs we/uni00A0sponsor to use at least 30% of our sponsorship money for sustainability, including diversity. Another element is levelling the international playing field for men and women in hockey.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Gender and cultural diversity\n\nABN AMRO is committed to creating a diverse workforce this is important for employee engagement and a pleasant working environment. Greater diversity, we believe, makes/uni00A0for better decision-making, and brings us closer to/uni00A0our clients.\n\nWe are working to improve diversity and inclusion within ABN AMRO - we want our people to be 'free to be who they are' and feel confident in the workplace. To back this up, various initiatives were taken, such as launching an integrated and innovative Diversity & Inclusion strategy, a/uni00A0number of external and internal mentoring programmes for women and for employees with a bicultural background and in March 2021 we launched a bank-wide 'unconscious bias' training for all our managers. We also support a range/uni00A0of initiatives, including the B-Able programme (programme for employees with disabilities) and Young Talent Leadership. And in October, over 6,000 employees participated in 50 workshops during the Diversity & Inclusion Week.\n\nAs part of our strategy, we have set very clear targets for gender diversity - overall, we want our workforce to be more representative of society, for example by bringing greater cultural diversity and more people with disabilities into the bank's workforce. In 2021, 30% of our subtop management are now women - up from 28% in 2020, right on track towards our 2024 target. For the top management level, we fell short of our target of 30%.\n\nIn addition to these targets, ABN AMRO monitors its gender pay gap, which narrowed in 2021 to 14.7% (compared with 13.7% in the Netherlands 1 ); the gap reflects the fact that, proportionally, more men than women occupy high-paid positions within the bank. ABN AMRO's goal is ultimately to/uni00A0reduce its gender pay gap to zero. The/uni00A0gender pay gap in/uni00A0the Netherlands corrected per salary scale is 0.27% in/uni00A0favour of male employees.\n\nAt the same time, we want to provide more job opportunities to people with disabilities, who often find it hard to remain in the labour market. Our aim is to employ at least 225 people with disabilities by 2025 - as our contribution to/uni00A0a/uni00A0Dutch government scheme to increase employment for/uni00A0those with disabilities.\n\nGoing into 2022, we will continue to work to improve our diversity performance and further intensify our efforts to improve on these targets, continuing our inclusively voiced job descriptions and 50/50 gender balanced inflow.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSubtop\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cultural diversity\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSubtop\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees with disabilities\n\n(headcount)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor definitions of 'subtop', see page xx.

Research/uni00A0suggests nearly a quarter of young people in the Netherlands find it hard to keep track of their finances. We spoke to Sara - not her real name - about how her ABN/uni00A0AMRO budget coach helped her get her finances back in order.\n\n'I'd been out of work for some time, when my father became seriously ill. I wanted to take care of him. I started to rack up debts - then, I made a mistake filling in my tax return, and I found I owed the tax authorities a lot of money.'\n\n'At first, my friends and family knew nothing about my money problems. I didn't want to burden my father with it during his illness, and it wasn't something I was proud of. My sister also had financial worries and I wanted to prove that I could look after myself.'\n\n'In the end, my mother really helped me. It was her idea to take a personal loan, and use that to pay off my other debts. Sadly, my father passed way. I didn't take time to grieve properly, and I started experiencing depression and panic attacks - so much so that I didn't want to go out of the house any more. It was really tough.'\n\n'Previously, I'd always worked in bars and restaurants. With Covid-19, there were no more jobs. That's when I/uni00A0got in touch with ABN AMRO. And the bank referred me to a budget coach. She was really sweet and understanding, and immediately put me at ease. I wasn't just a number to her she really wanted to help. She arranged a deferment for me,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nso I could put my affairs in order. I already had a good overview of my income and expenses. All I needed was a bit of breathing space - and the deferment gave me that.'\n\n- 'I wish I'd called sooner. Getting things sorted was a huge relief. And it's great to know my coach is still there if I have any questions about money matters.'\n\nDid you know that one in every five people between the/uni00A0ages of 18 and 26 cannot pay their bills? 1 In a world that is becoming more digitalised by the day, young people increasingly struggle to keep their spending in check. If/uni00A0you are concerned about money, remember that you are not alone.\n\nAre you also experiencing financial difficulties? People aged under 30, whether or not they are ABN AMRO clients, can also request a free meeting with a budget coach. Visit us at abnamro.nl and make an appointment.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

We continued to/uni00A0streamline our product portfolio, and began the move to a hybrid way of working, post-Covid. At the same time, we invested in skills, promoted greater diversity in our workforce, and pursued innovation in the use of data and new digital technologies all/uni00A0to ensure a viable business model for the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Guide for readers\n\nThis section looks at the third strategic pillar: a future-proof bank. We look at the progress we've made over the past year streamlining our internal processes and systems to further improve service to/uni00A0clients. In this section, we will be covering viable business model - one of our strategic differentiators; the remaining two differentiators related to this pillar can be found in Financial and business performance and Risk, funding & capital.\n\n## Simple, future-proof bank\n\nWe are turning ABN AMRO into a bank that is digital by design . To do this, we are digitalising more of our client and product processes and internal processes. By 2024, we want at least 90% of our high-volume processes to be automated. As an example of our client and product processes, in September, we became the first Dutch bank to offer 'cardless' cash withdrawals from ATMs - with this, clients can simply withdraw cash using their mobile phones.\n\nMeanwhile, we are further streamlining our product portfolio, based on client needs - and extending our full DevOps teams, where IT Development and IT Operations professionals work in integrated teams, using cloud technology. By year-end, 232 teams had made the switch to/uni00A0DevOps, up from 136 in 2020. We are building a futureproof bank by rigorously simplifying - the aim being to strengthen client service, improve efficiency and reduce operational risks. We continue to streamline our product\n\nportfolio around the/uni00A0needs of clients and are aiming for a 60% reduction by/uni00A02024, supporting further rationalisation, harmonisation and digitalisation of our product offering.\n\n## Simplifying our organisation and reducing risk\n\nWe are not only simplifying our processes; we are also simplifying our internal organisation. For us, this is about creating a viable, long-term business model, strengthening strategy execution and improving service to clients. We/uni00A0started work on a new client service model - and, from/uni00A0the start of 2022, we have replaced our current business lines. Instead, we now have three new units, organised around client segments: Personal & Business Banking, Wealth Management and Corporate Banking. Alongside this, we/uni00A0have moved to a single eight-member Executive Board 1 , replacing our previous Executive Board and Executive Committee.\n\nAt the same time we are continuing to wind/uni00A0down most of/uni00A0our Corporate & Institutional Banking activities outside Europe (except our global Clearing activities); the winddown is an important part of our strategy review, announced in 2020. The CIB non-core wind-down has been largely completed, with loans and advances to customers totalling/uni00A0EUR 1.5 billion, down by approximately 90% since/uni00A030 June 2020 - improving the bank's risk profile.\n\n## Innovation and new technologies\n\nIn recent years, banks' traditional business models have come under increasing pressure. In response to this, we have put in place an innovation strategy. This strategy looks at how we can use recent developments to create new products - and new, more convenient ways of banking for clients. To do this, we are focusing on three main areas:\n\n- 1 The new, expanded Executive Board will consist of ABN AMRO's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Innovation & Technology Officer, and/uni00A0the/uni00A0Chief Commercial Officers, respectively, of Personal & Business Banking, Wealth Management and Corporate Banking. Christian Bornfeld, ABN AMRO's current Chief Innovation & Technology Officer, has announced he will stand down in May 2022. A new Chief Innovation & Technology Officer will be appointed in due course. For more details, see page 207.",

We are also increasing our use of data - this helps us gain insight into client needs, and supports product development. Our data strategy focuses on three areas: making sure our data is fit for purpose; distributing authorised data quickly and securely within the bank; and unlocking the value of data by using it to create new business opportunities.\n\nWhere appropriate, we also work with external partners this allows us to experiment, learn and innovate together. We have a partnership with Techstars, giving us access to a global network of entrepreneurs and partners. Over the past year, we have also piloted a series of new initiatives including:\n\n- \u00c5 GreenDesk , a solution for corporate employees to/uni00A0book flexible workspaces close to their homes. 1\n- \u00c5 PayDay , providing flex workers with instant access to/uni00A0their earnings.\n- \u00c5 Personal Communication Channel (PCC) , an/uni00A0in-house system that allows highly secure and private communication between employees. 1\n- \u00c5 Cyber Learning , offering a learning solution for organisations to help employees recognise cyber risks. 1\n\nAt the same time, ABN AMRO is investing in fintech, so we can learn and partner with up-and-coming companies. In/uni00A02021, our Future of Finance Accelerator - in partnership with Techstars - worked with ten early-stage companies in sustainability and digital assets. We also increased the size of/uni00A0ABN AMRO Ventures - our venture capital fund - to EUR 150 million in capital. ABN AMRO Ventures makes fintech investments across Europe, the US and Israel; these include data privacy specialist Privitar and Solarisbank, one of a new breed of companies offering banking-as-a-service. In 2021, ABN AMRO Ventures invested in Upvest, Bux and Penta, and also increased its shareholding in Quantexa - a data analytics firm supporting our anti-money laundering programme.\n\n## Responsible tax\n\nABN AMRO sees tax as more than a cost to the company, rather as a means for social cohesion and contribution, sustainable growth and long-term prosperity. As such, we see tax as a key part of corporate social responsibility and governance. We are committed to comply with the letter, intent and spirit of tax legislation in the countries in which we operate; this means paying the right amount of tax at/uni00A0the right time.\n\nWe have a number of basic principles that govern our responsible tax approach which is aligned with the VNO-NCW Tax Governance Code (publication in 2022):\n\n- \u00c5 We use legal structures that result from commercial considerations, are aligned with our business activities and have genuine commercial substance.\n- \u00c5 Our relationships with tax authorities and other external stakeholders are characterised by mutual respect, transparency and trust.\n- \u00c5 We provide regular information to stakeholders (including investors, policymakers, employees, civil society and the general public) on our approach to tax issues and taxes paid. This transparency is embedded in our wider values and standards.\n\n## Governance & transparency\n\nGovernance of tax issues is overseen by ABN AMRO's Executive Board. Tax is regularly discussed in the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. For more details please refer to our Leadership & governance chapter on pages 205-257. Our tax principles are published online. These principles guide our actions and responsible tax behaviour, with respect to our own tax affairs and our dealings with clients. Our tax policy has been approved by/uni00A0our Executive Board.\n\nTo adhere to our tax policy and principles, we take into account measures introduced into national law to increase tax transparency and reporting. We report our taxable income and income taxes paid for each country we operate in (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements on page 287, showing our revenue, tax expenses and income taxes paid for each country). We also file a country-by-country report to the Dutch tax authorities.\n\nWe also comply with transparency rules with respect to our clients - these include the European Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). As part of these rules, we regularly exchange information on clients with the tax authorities. From the start of 2021, we also report information under the new EU/uni00A0Directive on Mandatory Disclosure Rules, known as DAC6, intended to prevent tax avoidance.\n\n- 1 For more information, see: abnamro.com/nl/nieuws/green-desk-biedt-werkplek-in-de-buurt, doorpakken.abnamro.nl/hulpmiddelen-en-diensten/personal-communication-channel, doorpakken.abnamro.nl/hulpmiddelen-en-diensten/cyber-learning.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

In addition, tax risk is identified as a/uni00A0separate risk and integrated into the bank's overall risk management cycle. Tax integrity is part of our strategic integrity risk assessment, which supports our risk-based approach to tax integrity risks. Consideration of tax risk is/uni00A0mandatory when preparing a risk assessment for a new/uni00A0product or business activity. We regularly monitor compliance with our tax policy and have process controls to/uni00A0ensure the bank files tax returns in good time in all jurisdictions where it is required to do so, and that tax risks/uni00A0and positions are promptly identified and reported. We/uni00A0engage pro-actively with tax authorities to ensure we/uni00A0have a complete understanding of our tax obligations.\n\nWith the rise in new technologies, we are increasingly required to exchange information with tax authorities, based on domestic and international regulations. In the coming years, we expect these rules to be extended with increased requirements for automated tax filing via full data lineage (including an automated audit trail from source to tax return - similar, for example, to the Making Tax Digital legislation in/uni00A0the UK).\n\n## Client tax integrity\n\nIn recent years, client tax integrity has grown in importance, with the issue of the so-called Panama and Pandora papers. Our standards in this area are based on ABN AMRO's core values and tax risk appetite. We adhere to a moderate risk appetite in line with the bank's wider risk profile. The Dutch central bank has a strong focus on client tax integrity, which resulted in the publication in 2019 of the Good Practices on/uni00A0Client Tax Integrity, providing guidance on structuring internal processes to identify and manage risk with respect/uni00A0to client tax integrity. In 2021, we finalised the implementation of these Good Practices. We support tax awareness sessions for client-facing staff to make sure they remain aware of integrity risks, particularly given rapidly changing international tax rules. With clients, we wish to steer clear of aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance; our intention is to offer products that comply with both the/uni00A0letter and the spirit of tax legislation, and that are commercially sound rather than tax-driven. This approach is included in our tax policy, tax principles and in our product approval process.\n\n## Crime and integrity\n\nWe have an important 'gatekeeper role' to help protect the financial system against crime and fraud. As part of this, we are constantly looking to improve our policies, processes and controls to meet regulatory obligations and minimise risk.\n\n## Due diligence\n\nIn all our business relationships, we carry out extensive due diligence on clients and third parties, including agents, intermediaries and suppliers with a view to minimising risk of the bank being involved in financial wrongdoing (money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption, tax evasion, etc.). We systematically monitor clients' activities and report any suspicious or unusual transactions to the relevant authorities.\n\nClients in high-risk situations (both existing and prospective clients) undergo additional due diligence; this includes politically exposed clients, those subject to adverse media coverage or living and working in countries or sectors with an inherently higher risk of financial crime. When assessing risk in this area, we also take into account geopolitical factors; unacceptable risks may lead to the rejection of the/uni00A0prospective client or third party or - in the case of an existing client - to an 'exit' from the bank. In 2021, we continued with our aim of being a frontrunner in Northwest Europe in managing financial crime risks. Part of this is delivering on our current remediation programme to address shortcomings in our approach to anti-money laundering ( see page 61 ).\n\nTo support our efforts, all ABN AMRO staff undergo preemployment screening; additional screening is carried out for those working in at-risk areas.

During the investigation, the NPPS found serious shortcomings in ABN AMRO processes to/uni00A0combat money laundering, such as the client acceptance, transaction monitoring and client exit processes, in the Netherlands in the period from 2014-2020. As a result, in certain instances, clients were able to abuse ABN AMRO accounts. As part of the AML settlement, the bank agreed to pay EUR 480 million. ABN AMRO was informed that an individual filed a complaint against the AML settlement between the NPPS and ABN AMRO and that the complaint has been denied by the court of appeals.\n\nTo address shortcomings in its AML programme the bank/uni00A0has prioritised remediation and enhancement programmes in each of the business lines of the bank over the years, as well as bank-wide with respect to transaction monitoring. ABN AMRO has invested heavily in these remediation and enhancement programmes over several years, including investments in its systems and the growth of its staff. Unfortunately, ABN AMRO has to/uni00A0recognise that, despite all of its efforts and intentions, its improvement programmes have not always had the desired effect, and that several shortcomings, some of which serious, have been identified.\n\nIn response to the shortcomings and in order to/uni00A0address increasingly strict regulations and continuously evolving forms of financial crime, ABN AMRO decided to/uni00A0centralise the execution of all AML activities in October of 2018, bolstering AML capabilities and enabling further\n\ntake part in mandatory training to recognise warning signs of financial crime (including 'red flags' for money laundering, corruption, fraud and conflicts of interest). Employees are required to immediately report actual and suspected incidents, irregularities or breaches relating to/uni00A0bribery or corruption. We also encourage employees to/uni00A0speak up if they know of risks or behaviour not in line/uni00A0with our principles or standards. Where possible, employees should discuss suspicions with their manager. If/uni00A0not, they should report their suspicions via the bank's whistleblower process, also open to external parties.\n\n## Combating bribery, corruption and fraud\n\nCorruption undermines fair business, restricts international trade, reduces investor confidence and may affect\n\nspecialisation and knowledge sharing across the bank. ABN AMRO set up a bank-wide AML programme and made substantial additional (financial) resources available for investments in staff, systems and processes. With the AML programme and the establishment of the/uni00A0AML unit ABN AMRO has implemented structural, organisational changes that are to lead to sustainable remediation. The/uni00A0remediation programmes have been coordinated with the Dutch central bank, which is/uni00A0closely monitoring progress. By the end of 2021, the/uni00A0total number of fulltime employees involved in AML had increased to over 5,000 FTE. ABN AMRO is making progress in the execution of its AML remediation programme, but the remediation is requiring more effort and ABN AMRO expects that the remediation will continue in 2023.\n\nABN AMRO is also actively involved in various publicprivate partnerships aimed at of contributing to safer society. Networks and partnerships are needed to combat the criminal networks. ABN/uni00A0AMRO continuously seeks new collaborations to design and adopt smarter solutions. We participate in a number of public and private partnerships, including the Terrorism Financing Taskforce, the Serious Crime Taskforce and in/uni00A0the area of/uni00A0human trafficking / corruption. Also we continue to/uni00A0work on public- and private cooperation, such as Transactie Monitoring NL, policy alignment, data taxonomy, taskforces and work groups.\n\nThe AML settlement marks the end of a painful and disappointing episode for ABN AMRO. The lessons we/uni00A0have learned from this experience drive us in our continued effort as gatekeepers to achieve a safer society and a financial system that meets the highest standards of integrity.\n\neconomic growth and stability. In accordance with regulatory requirements, we constantly monitor risks associated with money laundering, terrorism financing, bribery and corruption - we also maintain a strong framework of internal controls. These risks are included in our Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA). SIRA is based on both internal and external qualitative and quantitative information; it provides insight into the inherent and residual risks, and enables us to fulfil our gatekeeper's role. We believe it is our corporate social responsibility to conduct business free of bribery and corruption. At the same time, we work hard to prevent fraud by taking down fake websites and emails, using two-factor authentication, and/uni00A0closing down accounts to known fraudsters. A copy of/uni00A0our anti-bribery and corruption policy is available online.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Resilience to security threats\n\nABN AMRO's IT infrastructure connects directly to public\n\nnetworks; consequently, our processes and systems are inherently exposed to cyber attack. We have a responsibility to protect our clients' data, privacy and money. To do so, we/uni00A0have a well-established information security framework; this ensures the confidentiality, integrity and availability of/uni00A0information (and associated assets) at all times. The/uni00A0framework sets out roles and responsibilities within the/uni00A0bank, organisational structure and security directives that apply to the bank, its vendors and other third parties. In/uni00A0addition, we have a Corporate Information Security Office/uni00A0(CISO), responsible for detecting fraud. Our Security & Integrity Management department, meanwhile, monitors trends relating to fraud, information security and compliance breaches, and reports incidents and any losses suffered by/uni00A0the bank and/or its clients. Other departments also work/uni00A0closely together to help manage and prevent risk of financial crime - fraud and other forms of financial crime are included in our bank-wide Emerging Risk Scanner. At the same time, we are keen to raise awareness among both clients and employees. We publish security advice online and work with the police, financial authorities and other external partners to prevent financial crime. To support this framework, we are investing more in cybersecurity. In 2021, ABN AMRO bought new, self-healing cybersecurity software, which repairs itself when under attack. Since the pandemic, we have seen an increase in cyber threats, particularly from/uni00A0ransomware, tech support scamming and malware. We have put blocks in place - invisible to clients - to prevent spoofing (where criminals attempt to pass themselves off as bank employees).\n\n## Future of work\n\nPost-Covid, we are bringing in new ways of working. In/uni00A02021, we started moving to a hybrid model, where employees can split their time between working from home/uni00A0and at the office. This, we believe, will help improve their work-life balance and enhance well-being - a vital issue for employees following the pandemic. During the pandemic, we provided desks and other equipment to employees working from home - which again proved important during the December-January lockdown in the Netherlands. Over the past year, we have prioritised wellbeing; we have continued to provide regular advice and support to those working remotely. We have also expanded our range of 'MyWellBeing' programmes since the pandemic to address loneliness and working at home with children.\n\nHybrid working also means a change to our physical surroundings. Currently, we are refitting our Foppingadreef office in Amsterdam, creating more open spaces and meeting rooms. From 2025, Foppingadreef will become the/uni00A0principal hub for ABN AMRO employees in Amsterdam. During the year, we agreed the sale and leaseback of our/uni00A0head office at Gustav Mahlerlaan in Amsterdam.\n\nIn 2021, we also signed a new six-month collective labour agreement with the Dutch trade unions. The agreement includes new provisions on a home working allowance and/uni00A0an extension of parental leave.\n\nAt the same time, we are investing in new skills. Across/uni00A0the/uni00A0Netherlands, data and digital skills in particular are in demand. To implement our strategy, we need these skills - we also need expertise in other areas, such as project management and advisory. Generally, we prefer to/uni00A0'reskill' or 'upskill' rather than recruit from outside (see/uni00A0our feature on page 65). Our spending on external training and development totalled EUR 33 million in 2021. We have extensive education programmes, including the Compliance Academy, the DFC - or Detecting Financial Crime - Academy and the Circl Academy, responsible for/uni00A0all/uni00A0sustainability training. Our approach emphasises self-learning - we are not only creating a future workforce for ABN AMRO, we are also making it easier for employees leaving the bank to find other jobs. This is important at a time when many traditional banking jobs are being lost through automation. At ABN AMRO, we expect to reduce staffing levels by around 15% by 2024, though most of this will be accomplished by natural attrition.\n\n## Our working culture\n\nAlong with new ways of working, we realise ABN AMRO is also going through a culture change. Culture is an important part of our approach to human resources. Our Leading for Better programme helps managers adjust, giving them the opportunity to discuss issues such as personal leadership styles and how to balance short and long-term considerations.\n\nWe have also rolled out an updated version of our Code of/uni00A0Conduct - and a new Behavioural Risk Policy - as part of/uni00A0our efforts to increase employees' awareness of the importance of integrity, our core values and the bank's impact on society. Our goal is to ensure the bank is ahead of regulatory developments in this area - to strengthen trust in the bank and maintain a strong licence to operate.",

In 2021, our annual survey showed a slight decline to 82% in overall employee engagement after a significant increase the previous year. We are still ahead, however, of the Global Financial Services Benchmark and/uni00A0our own target of 80%.\n\nOur survey measures a range of categories (see table below). We scored strongly in inclusive environment, talent & development and efficiency. Senior management and vision & direction remain below the industry benchmark, however, motivating the Executive Board to give priority to connecting with all colleagues, at all times. Employee NPS - which measures whether employees would recommend ABN AMRO as an employer to friends and family - was also/uni00A0lower.\n\nOverall, engagement rates remain high, though we believe rates have been affected by continued frustration over Covid-19 restrictions and the anti-money laundering investigation in the Netherlands. To pinpoint specific, on-theground issues, we will again be working in 2022 to improve our performance in this area by continuing to invest in new skills, promoting diversity and introducing hybrid working in our offices. Results are regularly discussed by the Executive Board, broken down into each client unit to determine points for action by senior management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee engagement score\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Selected categories (ABN AMRO performance vs. Global Financial Services Benchmark)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABN AMRO\n\nGFS Benchmark\n\nScores are based on ABN AMRO's annual Employee Engagement Survey.

She talks here about how ABN/uni00A0AMRO's reskilling programme has brought new skills and perspectives to the/uni00A0bank's efforts to combat money laundering, fraud and other financial crime.\n\n'We've really expanded over the past several years. We started with a few hundred colleagues, we're now at 3,800. At the start, it was relatively easy to find the right people - now it's become really hard. We're seeing similar skills shortages across the economy. We have so many talented people at the bank we need to make full use of that talent. Otherwise, you're always having to bring in talent from outside.'\n\n'That's where our reskilling programme comes in. In the past year, ABN AMRO has developed different learning tracks to enable colleagues to apply to new roles where they obtain new skills. At DFC, for example, we've been looking to hire people with client experience. They may not have all the required due diligence research knowledge or experience , but they know the bank well. They know the products inside-out, and they know how to deal with clients. So they're bringing in a new valuable skill-set. That kind of combination of skills - if we can give them that technical, analytical knowledge as well - is really hard to find. And for DFC, it's invaluable. A lot of times we have to reach out to clients - if we see something unusual in their transactions, for example. Also, internally, we're working with a lot of different stakeholders - and it comes in handy there, too.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Our reskilling programme lasts four to six months. Candidates attend the DFC Academy, and they're given a/uni00A0coach - a buddy - to learn from. So they acquire both the/uni00A0soft and hard skills they need. We've got 14 'reskillers' currently going through the programme. In 2022, we want to increase that to 30. It's all part of broader workforce planning, so it operates alongside 'upskilling' - extending current skills, instead of learning new skills. We still recruit from outside, of course - that way, we get a balance and/uni00A0diversity within our teams.'\n\n'When choosing candidates for reskilling, the most important test by far is motivation -that 'want-to-learn' mind-set. It's/uni00A0not always an easy process. We need managers to be/uni00A0patient with 'reskillers' coming into their teams, who won't deliver perfect results immediately. It's also a cultural change - in the way the bank views employees and the way/uni00A0employees view themselves. And we need these skills not just in customer experience, but in data and digital and/uni00A0project management - all areas that will be vital to the/uni00A0bank in the years ahead. For those colleagues involved in reskilling, it opens up fantastic new perspectives and new/uni00A0opportunities to develop their careers.'\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Lars, how was your first year as ABN AMRO's Chief/uni00A0Financial Officer?\n\nWhat convinced me to join ABN AMRO was the sense of/uni00A0direction. The strategy is very well thought-through. Nearly a year later, nothing has happened to change my mind. In fact, what we've been able to achieve has only reinforced that view. We've made real progress this past/uni00A0year. The wind-down of the non-core activities of Corporate & Institutional Banking has gone much more quickly than expected. We are rolling out new initiatives for/uni00A0clients such/uni00A0as the Entrepreneur & Enterprise concept in/uni00A0the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. And we've just/uni00A0announced a new organisational set-up that truly aligns/uni00A0us/uni00A0with our clients, giving us a real client focus.\n\n## How easy was it to make these changes in an economy still overshadowed by Covid-19?\n\nCovid-19 has undoubtedly had an impact. For the Netherlands, 2021 got off to a rough start, then things improved in the second and third quarters with the introduction of vaccines - before we were all hit by Omicron. We continued to see government support measures, and those proved very effective. But that, of/uni00A0course, had an impact on demand for corporate loans, particularly among SMEs and mid-sized corporates because/uni00A0these companies were able to get Covid-19 financing from the government. In the last quarter,\n\ndemand/uni00A0picked up following the economic rebound. On/uni00A0the/uni00A0consumer side, we had a good year in mortgages. There was a lot of transaction volume - and a good part of/uni00A0that was refinancing. The competition is tough, but we're/uni00A0looking to/uni00A0grow our market share in mortgages. Repositioning Moneyou will help in that respect - it means we can pick up more of that/uni00A0refinancing. In terms of our overall top line, there is still considerable pressure, also because we're very dependent on net interest income.\n\n## How can you combat that topline pressure? Banks/uni00A0like ABN AMRO have had to live with low/uni00A0interest rates for a very long time now.\n\nWe're pulling all the levers we can. Hopefully, as we come out of the pandemic, we'll see some return to normality. Through the TLTRO programme, we were able to offer lower rates to clients. That's really helped with loan volumes - but more importantly it's put us in the room when clients start to talk about their financing needs, post-pandemic. We've taken other measures, too. At the beginning of 2022 the threshold for charging negative rates has been further lowered to EUR 100,000 per client. And we're looking to increase income from fees - by growing advisory and introducing new payment packages. Interest rates have started to rise in recent months, which will benefit the bank's net interest income. However, the positive impact for 2022 is quite limited as these higher rates only slowly",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## ' We've made a lot of progress, but the hard part starts now mobilising the whole bank to deliver on our strategy and become a performance led organisation.'\n\nimprove deposit margins. This positive impact will build in/uni00A0time and likely bring forward the moment our quarterly net interest income bottoms out, which we currently expect in the second half of 2023. We are also dependent on how/uni00A0quickly the ECB starts raising its policy rates which would raise short term interest rates.\n\n## At the same time, the bank is cutting costs. Are you still on course to meet your cost target?\n\nWe said EUR 5.3 billion in costs for 2021 (excluding settlements and reorganisation charges), and that's what we've achieved. For 2024, our commitment is to bring that down below EUR 4.7 billion. We're determined to meet that, too. It won't be easy - a lot of initiatives will have to come together. The wind-down of the non-core activities of/uni00A0Corporate & Institutional Banking will help, but it's also about rationalising our product suite, automating more of/uni00A0our processes, taking out old, inefficient legacy systems and moving onto the cloud - as well as centralising and offshoring where it makes sense to do so. At the same time, we are seeing some inflationary pressures, largely through rising energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks as the economy emerges from Covid-19 but we don't think these pressures are permanent. In the area of anti-money laundering which accounts for more than 20% of our workforce and around 10% of our cost base, we expect these costs to peak in 2021, and then to start to come down as we finalise remediation and make better use of/uni00A0AI/uni00A0and new technology.\n\n## How do you assess ABN AMRO's capital position? You've just announced the Inaugural share buyback.\n\nIf you look at our capital ratios, we're in a strong position. TRIM - the European Central Bank's review of capital models - is pretty much behind us and we're very well positioned for Basel IV. Last month we announced our first EUR 500 million share buyback programme. We have opted for a gradual release of capital, potentially resulting in\n\nmultiple buybacks over a period of time rather than a large buyback without follow-up. Going forward, share buybacks will be an integral part of our capital management practice and a tool to optimise our capital position. Over time I expect the amount of capital we hold over and above our target to gradually decrease as we work through regulatory changes and uncertainties are resolved. I trust this framework will lead to more predictable capital distributions.\n\n## What are the priorities now, for you and the bank, going into 2022?\n\nFirst, 2022 should be a better year for us all than 2021 was/uni00A0-- which, in turn, was a better year than 2020 because we're learning how to live with Covid-19, certainly in terms of avoiding the kind of lockdowns we've seen over the past two years. The economy, though, should start returning to/uni00A0normal, with interest rates rising. We've made a lot of/uni00A0progress, but the hard part starts now - mobilising the/uni00A0whole bank to deliver on our strategy and become a/uni00A0performance-led organisation. I have to say, from what I've seen ABN AMRO definitely has the ability and the people to do that. Over the next few years we'll have to show how we're improving service for our clients, how we're cutting costs, how we're rationalising our product portfolio. As the CFO, what interests me is whether we're delivering on our financial targets, particularly whether we're hitting that 8 to 10 percent return on equity figure. But we won't be able to achieve that if we don't deliver on/uni00A0the strategy.\n\n## Lars Kramer\n\nCFO of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.\n\n1",

The/uni00A0transaction resulted in a gain of EUR/uni00A0327/uni00A0million (EUR/uni00A0245/uni00A0million net of tax) in/uni00A0other operating income at Group Functions.\n\n## Provision for revolving consumer credit with floating interest/uni00A0rates\n\nThe provision for/uni00A0the compensation scheme regarding revolving consumer credit with/uni00A0floating interest rates was recorded in 2021. This relates to the compensation of/uni00A0clients who paid too much interest on their revolving consumer credit in the past and ABN AMRO's decision (where possible) to proactively recalculate variable interest charged from 1 January 2001. In Q3 and Q4 2021, a cumulative provision of/uni00A0EUR 306 million was booked in Retail Banking, consisting of EUR 265 million for/uni00A0an NII provision, EUR/uni00A050/uni00A0million for handling costs, and a EUR 9 million release on/uni00A0credit impairments.\n\n## AML settlement\n\nIn 2021, ABN AMRO accepted a settlement offer from the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service following the latter's investigation into the bank's anti-money laundering (AML) activities in the Netherlands. As part of the settlement, ABN AMRO agreed to pay a fine of EUR/uni00A0300/uni00A0million and a disgorgement of EUR/uni00A0180/uni00A0million. The/uni00A0total amount of EUR/uni00A0480/uni00A0million (not tax deductible) is recorded in other expenses at Group Functions.\n\n## Provision for repayment\n\nThe figures for 2021 include a EUR/uni00A079/uni00A0million net negative impact, of which EUR/uni00A030/uni00A0million was recorded in net interest income and EUR/uni00A049/uni00A0million in other operating income, both at Group Functions. This mainly relates to a repayment of German dividend withholding tax credits and accrued interest. The amounts have been repaid in anticipation of a decision by the German tax authorities.\n\n## Positive  revaluation  of  DSB  claim\n\nThe figures for 2021 include a positive revaluation of EUR/uni00A026/uni00A0million for the claim on/uni00A0the DSB bankruptcy estate, which related to the sale of the underlying mortgage portfolio to/uni00A0NIBC/uni00A0and is recorded in net interest income at Group Functions. The/uni00A0figures for 2020 included a positive revaluation of/uni00A0EUR/uni00A023/uni00A0million/uni00A0for the claim, recorded in net interest income at Group Functions.\n\n## Revaluation of equity stake in Tink\n\nThe figures for 2021 include a EUR 41 million revaluation gain on ABN AMRO's equity stake in Tink (via ABN AMRO Ventures), recorded in other operating income at/uni00A0Retail Banking.\n\n## CIB non-core wind-down\n\nThe figures for 2021 include a EUR 121 million discount to book value on a loan disposal as part of the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio, recorded in other operating income. This related to the sale of a portfolio of energy loans that effectively ended ABN/uni00A0AMRO's exposure to the oil & gas industry in the USA.\n\nThe figures for 2020 included a total of EUR/uni00A0160/uni00A0million for one-off costs relating to/uni00A0the/uni00A0wind-down of/uni00A0the CIB non-core portfolio, of which EUR/uni00A0103/uni00A0million was/uni00A0recorded in personnel expenses and EUR/uni00A057/uni00A0million in other expenses. Furthermore,/uni00A0a/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0120/uni00A0million write-off for deferred tax assets was recorded in/uni00A0income tax expense.\n\n## Adjusted accounting estimates for amortisation of penalty interest on mortgages\n\nIn 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO adjusted its accounting estimate for amortisation of penalty interest on mortgages to reflect client behaviour over the past years. This resulted in/uni00A0a one-off charge of EUR/uni00A080/uni00A0million, recorded in net interest income at ALM in Group Functions.\n\n## Sale and leaseback of Paris office\n\nIn 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO completed the sale and leaseback of the Neuflize OBC office/uni00A0building in Paris. The book gain before tax amounted to EUR/uni00A0263/uni00A0million (EUR/uni00A0181/uni00A0million net of tax) and was recognised in other operating income at Private/uni00A0Banking.\n\n## Provision for SME derivatives-related issues\n\nThe figures for 2020 include a EUR/uni00A015/uni00A0million release from the provision for client compensation for SME derivatives-related issues, recorded in other operating income (at CIB).\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nThe figures for 2020 include EUR 11 million net in restructuring provisions, excluding CIB non-core, recorded in personnel expenses, of which EUR 9 million was recorded at Private Banking.\n\n## Release for discretionary variable remuneration\n\nPersonnel expenses in 2020 included a EUR/uni00A022/uni00A0million release for discretionary variable remuneration at CIB.\n\n## Provision for AML programme\n\nOther expenses in 2020 included an addition of EUR/uni00A044/uni00A0million to the provision for/uni00A0the AML remediation programme (largely recorded at Group Functions).\n\n## Goodwill impairment at Private Banking Belgium\n\nOther expenses in 2020 included a EUR/uni00A034/uni00A0million goodwill and intangible impairment at/uni00A0Private Banking Belgium.\n\n## Release relating to tax deductibility of AT1 coupon payments\n\nIn 2020, following a Dutch court ruling regarding the tax deductibility of AT1 coupon payments, a release of EUR/uni00A055/uni00A0million was recorded in tax to reflect the relief on AT1/uni00A0coupon payments in 2019 and 2020.",

Excluding large incidentals, net interest income decreased by EUR/uni00A0534/uni00A0million, mainly due to continued pressure on/uni00A0deposit margins in a low interest rate environment and/uni00A0to lower average corporate loan volumes following the/uni00A0wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio. In order to/uni00A0relieve the pressure on deposit margins, ABN AMRO started charging negative rates of interest on client deposits and lowered the negative rate threshold in phases (deposit threshold Q1 2021: EUR/uni00A0500,000; Q3 2021: EUR/uni00A0150,000; Q1 2022: EUR/uni00A0100,000).\n\n## Net fee and commission income /uni00A0increased to\n\nEUR/uni00A01,664/uni00A0million, which was EUR/uni00A0106/uni00A0million higher than/uni00A0in 2020.

The increase was partly offset by a decrease in/uni00A0CIB non-core in relation to the wind-down.\n\nOther operating income amounted to EUR/uni00A0724/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0494/uni00A0million). The figures for 2021 include a/uni00A0gain of EUR/uni00A0327/uni00A0million on the sale and leaseback of our head office in Amsterdam, while our 2020 results included a EUR/uni00A0263/uni00A0million book gain on the sale of our office building in Paris. In addition, volatile items (consisting of/uni00A0equity participation results, CVA/DVA/FVA and hedge accounting-related results) were significantly higher in 2021 (gain of EUR/uni00A0178/uni00A0million versus a loss of EUR/uni00A04/uni00A0million in 2020). This was partly offset by a EUR/uni00A0121/uni00A0million discount to book value on a loan disposal in the CIB non-core portfolio recorded in 2021.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased by EUR/uni00A044/uni00A0million, totalling EUR/uni00A02,324/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A02,280/uni00A0million). Excluding large incidentals, personnel expenses rose, mainly due to an increase in FTEs at the bank's AML activities, combined with overall wage inflation.\n\nOther expenses rose by EUR/uni00A0506/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A03,482/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A02,976/uni00A0million), mainly due to the AML/uni00A0settlement (EUR/uni00A0480/uni00A0million in Q1 2021) and higher regulatory levies (EUR/uni00A0435/uni00A0million versus EUR/uni00A0368/uni00A0million in/uni00A02020). Excluding incidentals and regulatory levies, other expenses increased by around EUR/uni00A050/uni00A0million, largely due to higher non-employee FTEs (2021: 6,524 versus 2020: 5,621), partly to support our AML activities.\n\nImpairment releases in 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A046/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A02,303/uni00A0million addition). Releases were attributable to a more favourable/uni00A0economic scenario during the year, partly offset by additions from management overlays. The/uni00A0cost of risk amounted to -7bps in 2021 (2020: 78bps).\n\nIncome tax expenses amounted to EUR/uni00A0604/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0401/uni00A0million). The increase was attributable to higher taxable profit recorded in 2021 compared to the previous year, mainly driven by a significantly lower level of impairment charges and the sale and leaseback of our head office. The effective tax rate in 2021 was 33%, compared with the standard Dutch rate of 25%. This was mainly driven by the AML settlement in Q1 2021, which is not tax deductible.\n\n1",

This increase was mainly attributable to the upscaling of AML activities, as well as to higher regulatory levies (EUR/uni00A0224/uni00A0million versus EUR/uni00A0192/uni00A0million in 2020). The figure for 2021 also includes a charge for the cost of handling the compensation scheme for revolving consumer credit (EUR/uni00A050/uni00A0million).\n\nImpairment charges recorded a release of EUR/uni00A041/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A077/uni00A0million addition), mainly in stages 1 and 2.\n\n## Other indicators\n\nLoans and advances customers\n\ndecreased\n\nby/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00.8/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A0147.7/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A0148.5/uni00A0billion), mainly driven by lower consumer loans in 2021.\n\nTotal client assets iremained stable at EUR/uni00A099.7/uni00A0billion in/uni00A02021.",

Meanwhile net interest income at CIB core increased.\n\nNet fee and commission income/uni00A0 decreased to EUR/uni00A0515/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0529/uni00A0million). At CIB core, net fee and commission income increased by EUR/uni00A042/uni00A0million, driven mainly by Clearing (due to higher market volatility) and Global Markets (stronger capital market fees). This increase was offset by a decline at CIB/uni00A0non-core due to the wind-down.\n\nOther operating income increased by EUR/uni00A0131/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0163/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A032/uni00A0million). The increase was mainly due to a favourable result from private equity participations (EUR/uni00A092/uni00A0million versus EUR/uni00A055/uni00A0million negative in 2020) and higher CVA/DVA/FVA (EUR/uni00A046/uni00A0million versus EUR/uni00A08/uni00A0million negative in 2020). This was partly offset by the discount on the book value of loan disposals as part of the wind-down.\n\nPersonnel expenses declined/uni00A0by EUR/uni00A054/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0430/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0484/uni00A0million). Expenses in 2020 included a one-off provision for the CIB non-core wind-down and discretionary variable remuneration. This/uni00A0was partly offset by higher expenses at CIB core due\n\nto an increase in FTEs and overall wage inflation.\n\nOther expenses decreased by EUR/uni00A034/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0693/uni00A0million in 2021, compared with EUR/uni00A0727/uni00A0million in/uni00A02020. The latter included a one-off provision relating to the CIB non-core wind-down. The decrease in 2021 was partly offset by higher costs related to AML activities and strategic initiatives, as well as higher levies (EUR/uni00A0109/uni00A0million versus EUR/uni00A089/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\nImpairment charges recorded a net release of EUR/uni00A037/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A01,659/uni00A0million addition). The charge for 2020 primarily comprised stage 3 additions for (non-core) TCF clients, mainly in the energy sector.\n\n## Other indicators\n\nLoans and advances customers increased by EUR/uni00A05.3/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A050.6/uni00A0billion in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A045.3/uni00A0billion), mainly at Clearing. This more than offset/uni00A0the decrease in client loans. /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n- \u00c5 Client loans decreased by EUR/uni00A03.0/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A028.6/uni00A0billion in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A031.6/uni00A0billion), largely because of lower loan volumes at CIB noncore. At the same time, our core business reported an increase in client loans during the year to EUR/uni00A026.6/uni00A0billion./uni00A0\n\nDue to customers increased by EUR/uni00A09.4/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A038.1/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A028.7/uni00A0billion) due to higher client deposits resulting from excess liquidity as an effect of Covid-19, and to higher professional deposits.",

Going into 2022, the world is now better prepared and has demonstrated resilience. The economic outlook remains uncertain despite society moving to a postpandemic situation, but we expect economies to grow. At the same time, challenges such as climate change and social inequality have intensified.\n\n## Economic and business environment\n\nWe expect the Dutch economy to continue its postCovid-19 recovery in 2022. ABN AMRO Group Economics expects the economy to grow by 3.0%, slower than in 2021, but/uni00A0well above the economy's long-term growth trend. The/uni00A0eurozone economy shows a similar trend, with growth expected to slow to 3.7% in 2022. The economic recovery, in both the Netherlands and the eurozone, remains vulnerable, not least because of supply chain pressures. New lockdowns or a further tightening of restrictions, similar to those imposed in the Netherlands in December and January, may slow the recovery going forward.\n\nThe labour market is currently very tight. Unemployment stood at 3.8% in December. Given that there is little to no slack in the Dutch labour market and in combination with unfavourable demographics, the withdrawal of government support measures in 2022 will only lead to a small increase in unemployment in 2022. Further restructuring may be seen in sectors affected by the pandemic, including hospitality, retail, and transport.\n\nStrong worldwide demand, coupled with rising energy prices (particularly natural gas), has caused inflation to rise in the Netherlands. These temporary factors will also drive inflation in the first half of 2022. Group Economics expects the inflationary pressures to ease mid-2022, as energy price inflation will run out of steam and supply side issues will fade since the impact of the pandemic and corresponding restrictions is expected to wane.\n\nThere is no immediate prospect of an increase in short-term interest rates. Long-term rates are set to rise slightly due to/uni00A0spillover effects from rising treasuries resulting from a/uni00A0normalisation of monetary policy in the United States.\n\nFor ABN AMRO, low interest rates will continue to put pressure on deposit margins. As the government will withdraw its support schemes in the course of 2022, bank lending to the corporate sector should steadily improve. The/uni00A0economy, however, still has abundant liquidity after several years of central bank intervention.\n\nWe expect house prices in the Netherlands to continue rising. Market fundamentals remain broadly unchanged, with tight housing supply and low interest rates driving demand for mortgages. Our forecast is for a further price rise of 12.5% in 2022, following a 15% increase in 2021. The housing market shows signs of overheating, but as the/uni00A0drop in mortgage rates has ended the market is set to/uni00A0ease off.\n\n## Society and climate change\n\nClimate change is likely to remain centre stage, following the/uni00A0COP26 conference in Glasgow in November 2021. Governments are under pressure to take further action to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Across Europe, governments are stressing the importance of a green recovery. We expect continued strong demand for sustainability financing in 2022. New regulations will help support this demand. During the year, the EU will continue the roll-out of its taxonomy for sustainable activities. It is also expected to issue further guidance to accompany SFDR.\n\nSociety's expectations of ABN AMRO will remain high. Post-Covid, there is increased scrutiny of the bank's approach to social issues like diversity and equality. In the labour market, we are seeing continued skills shortages across Europe. These shortages are most noticeable in areas such as data analytics and digital marketing. Even after the pandemic, we do not expect a return to former working practices. Hybrid working will require continued adjustment - from both an operational and a cultural point of view.",

We will continue to/uni00A0execute on our strategy in becoming a personal bank in the digital age. We will continue to invest in digital banking, improve customer experience, reduce costs and simplify our operating model. We will also continue the shift to digital banking for our clients and scale up sustainable financing. By the end of 2024, we want to increase the/uni00A0percentage of sustainable acceleration asset volume to/uni00A0at/uni00A0least 36%.\n\nBased on the interest rates current economic outlook at/uni00A0the/uni00A0end of 2021 we expect pressure on net interest income, mainly from continued low interest rates and margin pressure across all business lines, to bottom out by/uni00A0the second half of 2023. To address this, we are looking to increase income from fees and commissions and continuing to grow in our strategic focus areas.\n\nWe remain focused on cost discipline and continue to execute on our well-substantiated cost saving plans, mostly/uni00A0from further product and process optimisation. We/uni00A0expect our cost base to start declining during 2022, also as AML costs have peaked in 2021. Our strategic cost/uni00A0savings programmes will broadly offset cost increases from inflation and other cost increases. We remain firmly/uni00A0on/uni00A0track to drive our cost below EUR/uni00A04.7 billion by 2024. We have adjusted our through-the-cycle cost-of-risk guidance to around 20bps, mainly driven by the de-risking of our balance sheet from the wind-down of CIB non-core and/uni00A0the/uni00A0tightened risk/uni00A0appetite.\n\nWe announced a EUR 500 million share buy-back in February 2022, which we plan to complete by June 2022.

How successful has the bank been in that?\n\nI'd say it's been a very good year in terms of de-risking. The wind-down of non-core activities in Corporate & Institutional Banking has taken some of the volatility out of our risk costs. At the same time, we completed the anti-money laundering (AML) investigation. We also reached agreement with the Dutch Consumers' Association on compensation for revolving consumer credit. These files had a long history. The AML settlement, in particular, was an important moment. We've made progress on the execution of our remediation programme, but the remediation is requiring more effort and/uni00A0we/uni00A0expect that the remediation will continue in 2023. The/uni00A0activities, however, are here to stay. It's part of our dayto-day business, and needs to be if we're to retain trust and our long-term licence to operate. Unfortunately, criminals will continue to try using the banking system for fraud, financial crime and drugs money. So we have to be vigilant and to play that vital role of gatekeeper.\n\n## Has the wind-down at Corporate & Institutional Banking gone much faster than originally expected?\n\nIt has - the team there has done a great job. We had a lot of/uni00A0interest in the assets we were selling, partly because there's so much liquidity around in the markets, and so the/uni00A0process has actually been more capital-accretive than we had anticipated. Most of the wind-down has now been completed. What we have left - maybe 10% - we're comfortable with. Any non-performing loans there may be/uni00A0are very well provisioned.\n\n## Is this phase of de-risking for the bank now over?\n\nWe're certainly approaching the end of it. So, less and less energy will now go into de-risking and more into building and growing the bank in the areas we've identified as part of the strategy - in Northwest Europe, among SMEs, and in/uni00A0the mortgage business. To say we're de-risking doesn't mean we're not taking any risks. A bank is all about taking risks to support the economy and help clients develop their businesses. But I feel that our risk profile is now pretty much where we'd like it to be. That's why we've recently been able to lower our cost-of-risk outlook. At the same time, a lot of the uncertainty on capital requirements has gone. The Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) is complete and, you'll notice, our main capital ratios mean we've been able to bring the bank largely into line with the/uni00A0new rules under Basel IV.",

That's why we've recently been able to lower our cost-of-risk outlook'\n\n## What about the outlook for the corporate sector, particularly when the government withdraws the/uni00A0financial support it's been providing during the/uni00A0pandemic?\n\nCertainly, Covid-19 has been with us throughout 2021, and for much longer than we'd hoped. Some sectors have been hit very hard, but others have been able to cope well with the pandemic. We see the same trend among our own clients. The government has also stepped in with support for those sectors worst affected. Of course, these are real people and real businesses who've suffered during the pandemic. Even so, they represent only a small part of the overall economy. Most of our clients are not at all dependent on government support. So we're not expecting any kind of/uni00A0cliff-edge when that support is withdrawn. If you look at our credit risk profile, we've had to make a few additional provisions, but we've also had provision releases, and these have more or less offset each other. This strong credit quality means,/uni00A0for 2021, that our cost of risk was just below zero. Overall, the economy has actually proved fairly resilient despite Covid-19. Going into next year, in terms of risk, we've got higher inflation, which could mean higher interest rates at the longer end. Inevitably, higher rates will impact on companies and their ability to invest.\n\n## How do you view the current boom in house prices in the Netherlands. Is the market becoming overheated?\n\nHouse prices have been continuing to rise, but the outlook is still positive. One of the factors behind this is really the shortage of houses in the Netherlands. That's putting upward pressure on prices. It's always possible there will be a correction. It is not the most likely scenario, although we obviously consider that possibility, and what it would mean for our mortgage portfolio. It's our job to look at all scenarios and to be prepared for them, even those we think aren't most likely.\n\n## What about climate risk? How well integrated is this/uni00A0into your risk management and modelling?\n\nIt's still a work in progress. In terms of our models, we have to think through the effects of climate change, sector by sector, company by company, and look at where a transition to achieve carbon neutrality or a lower carbon footprint is needed. We also have to consider how we can work with\n\nclients to finance that transition. And that brings us back to/uni00A0credit risk. There will be an EU-wide climate stress test in/uni00A02022, which will be very useful in helping banks like ABN/uni00A0AMRO to think through the implications. In many respects, this begins with data from companies we're lending to. And getting data that is reliable and consistent, which is not always the case right now. In credit risk management, we have a common language, and this is a language we've had for years. But in sustainability, that common language is still in/uni00A0development. What helps, however, is that sustainability is/uni00A0a key part of our purpose and strategy, and we have appropriate policies in place. In the case of higher-risk clients we already carry out additional assessments. What we need to do now is to take that approach up a notch and start looking at risk across our portfolios, and not just at the/uni00A0higher-risk areas. This is going to be a gradual process; it's/uni00A0not going to happen overnight. We have decided to set up an Executive Board Sustainability Committee to oversee our approach, both to risks and opportunities, and so are focusing strongly on this at the highest level in the bank.\n\n## As Chief Risk Officer, one of your priorities/uni00A0going into/uni00A02022 is climate change. But presumably that won't be the only one?\n\nOf course we have to prepare for climate change; the climate won't wait for us. That's why we're focusing on transition sectors as part of our growth strategy, and specifically on energy, mobility and digital. AML also remains an important topic: we're committing a lot of resources to that. Cyber security, too, is very important. We appreciate the growing risk that cyber attacks and data loss represent for our clients, whether they're corporations or individuals, and we need to/uni00A0help these clients to become more resilient and so less vulnerable. Neither of these topics - AML or cyber security - are going to disappear any time soon. At the same time, it's important to keep focusing on our risk culture; in other words, on ensuring a continuous focus on risks within the bank. That's something we pay a lot of attention to because risks change and evolve over time, and new risks emerge - and we have to be ready for that.\n\n## Tanja Cuppen\n\nCRO of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.",

As/uni00A0this/uni00A0chapter of the Integrated Annual Report contains information based on EU/uni00A0IFRS as well as CRD V/CRR2, this section provides more information on/uni00A0differences in scope and consolidation.\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nThe Risk, funding & capital chapter presents the disclosures required under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op/uni00A0financieel toezicht - Wft), title 9 book 2 of the Dutch Civil/uni00A0Code and EU IFRS. ABN/uni00A0AMRO also embraces the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) principles and recommendations. For non-financial disclosures required under the Dutch Decree on non-financial disclosures, ABN/uni00A0AMRO follows the guidance of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial disclosures (TCFD) and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), including its guidelines. Certain disclosures in the Risk, funding & capital chapter are an integral part of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements (AFS) and contain audited information. The audited parts concern risk disclosures of financial instruments (IFRS 7) and capital disclosures (IAS 1). Audited/uni00A0information in these sections is labelled as 'Audited' in the respective headings.\n\n## Risk exposure measurement and scope differences\n\nRisk measures vary according to the purpose for which the/uni00A0exposure is calculated: EU IFRS or the determination of/uni00A0regulatory or economic capital (CRD V/CRR2).\n\n## EU IFRS reporting scope\n\nThe objective of the financial statements is to provide financial information about the bank that is useful to the/uni00A0primary users of the financial statements in making decisions. Financial information is useful when it is relevant/uni00A0and reliably represents what it purports to represent. Financial statements provide information about/uni00A0the financial position of the bank and the effects of/uni00A0transactions and other events that change the bank's financial position. The consolidation scope of ABN/uni00A0AMRO is/uni00A0determined in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. More information can be found in/uni00A0Note 1 Accounting policies in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Regulatory reporting scope\n\nThe objective of regulatory reporting is to take a credit risk view on the bank's portfolio and to ensure that the bank maintains sufficient capital buffers for unexpected losses and sufficient liquidity buffers. The scope of consolidation for the purpose of calculating regulatory and economic capital (based on the CRD V and CRR2) is generally the same as the consolidation scope under EU IFRS and includes subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly controlled by ABN/uni00A0AMRO and active in the banking and financial sectors. Subsidiaries consolidated under EU IFRS but active/uni00A0in sectors other than banking and finance are excluded from the regulatory scope of consolidation.",

        "page_content": "## Loans and advances\n\nIn 2021, total loans and advances rose to EUR/uni00A0261.4/uni00A0billion at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 254.8/uni00A0billion), predominantly because of other loans and advances and, to a lesser extent, residential mortgages. This increase was partly offset by modest declines in loans and advances to banks, consumer loans and corporate loans. Higher collateral and default fund contributions for Clearing clients were the main contributor to the increase in other loans and advances. The CIB non-core portfolio was reduced to EUR/uni00A02.0/uni00A0billion at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A011.0/uni00A0billion) and consisted mainly of clients in the oil and gas, industrial goods and services, and basic resources sectors in the Netherlands, USA and Asia.\n\n## Exposure at Default\n\nExposure at Default (EAD) increased to EUR/uni00A0417.2/uni00A0billion (31/uni00A0December 2020: EUR/uni00A0407.4/uni00A0billion), mainly due to business developments in Clearing, as well as in Commercial Banking, due to new client lending in the context of TLTRO. In addition, EAD increased as a result of an update in the EAD model for corporate loans and the implementation of the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk in Global Markets. This increase was partly offset by a decline in cash and balances at central banks.\n\n## Credit quality indicators\n\nThe credit quality indicators improved modestly in 2021. During the year, the forbearance ratio/uni00A0gradually improved to 4.3% at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 5.1%). This was mainly related to the CIB non-core wind-down and was reflected in lower forborne corporate loans for clients in the USA, Asia and the Rest of the world, and in the oil\n\n## RWA flow statement credit risk\n\n(in millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economic capital\n\nEconomic capital (EC) slightly increased to EUR/uni00A019.1/uni00A0billion (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A019.0/uni00A0billion), mainly reflecting a decrease in own funding spread risk (EUR/uni00A01.2/uni00A0billion) and business risk EC (EUR/uni00A00.3/uni00A0billion) and higher credit risk EC (EUR/uni00A01.5/uni00A0billion). The decrease in own funding spread risk EC was driven by model changes related to the size of the\n\nassumed shock to funding spread and the loss horizon. The decrease in business risk EC was mainly attributable to model changes and the removal of model risk add-ons. Credit risk EC increased, mainly due to credit model changes and add-ons mirrored by regulatory capital, partly offset by the CIB non-core wind-down. Operational risk EC increased slightly owing to re-assessed scenarios.\n\nand gas and industrial goods and services/uni00A0sectors. The amount of total forborne assets is still considerable, especially in the case of residential mortgages and corporate loans, as a result of the high inflow in 2020 due to Covid-19 and developments in the oil price.\n\nCompared to December 2020, the past due ratio for loans and advances improved from 1.0% to 0.8%. Total arrears declined by EUR/uni00A00.5/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A02.1/uni00A0billion, particularly on the back of benign economic conditions such as low unemployment and relatively stable household earnings.\n\nThe stage 3 ratio also improved in 2021, predominantly as a result of the further reduction in the CIB non-core loan book, including the sale of the Trade & Commodity Finance portfolio and the North American oil and gas portfolio in the first six months of 2021.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nTotal RWA rose to EUR 117.7 billion (31 December 2020: EUR 110.5 billion), predominantly driven by credit risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was mainly caused by model changes (including regulatory add-ons) and by new/uni00A0methodology and policy, predominantly in relation to/uni00A0the impact of the DNB mortgage floor. This increase was/uni00A0partly/uni00A0offset by lower business volumes as a result of the CIB non-core wind-down. Operational risk RWA slightly decreased, mainly due to the removal of a regulatory capital add-on relating to an ECB finding on the model validation process. Market risk RWA increased due to increases in SVaR and IRC, partly offset by a decrease in VaR resulting from position changes.",

The increase in due to customers reflected increased client savings in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the related lockdowns. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) both remained above 100% throughout 2021.\n\n## Capital ratios\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) decreased to 16.3% (31 December 2020: 17.7%) due to an increase in RWA and a decrease in CET1 capital. The latter was driven by the settlement payment of EUR/uni00A0480/uni00A0million following the investigation into ABN/uni00A0AMRO's compliance with its obligations under the Dutch Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing Act, by deductions for the announced share buyback programme and by a further increase in capital deductions for/uni00A0non-performing exposures (NPE), which were only partly offset by the net profit for 2021. The leverage ratio (excluding the impact of the temporary exemption of central bank reserves) remained stable at 5.0% (31 December 2020: 5.0%), while MREL improved to 27.9% (31 December 2020: 27.4%), mainly due to issuances of senior non-preferred instruments.\n\n1",

We maintain a/uni00A0sound balance between risk and reward and pursue a bank-wide moderate risk profile as part of our long-term strategy. We thoroughly evaluate the long-term risk and/uni00A0return implications of our operations on an ongoing basis. Covid-19-related challenges continue to keep the management focus on the risk framework. For more information on the impact of Covid-19 on the bank's risk/uni00A0profile, please refer to Update on Covid-19 in the Credit/uni00A0risk review section.\n\n## Risk taxonomy b\n\nOur risk taxonomy classifies the bank's risks into risk types to which the bank is or could be exposed to.\n\n## Risk taxonomy\n\nb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## External causal factors\n\nPolitics, (macro)economy, society, technology, environmental, social and governance (ESG), legislation, regulation\n\n## Enterprise risk\n\n## Credit risk\n\nDefault risk Migration risk Collateral quality risk Country risk Sovereign risk Counterparty credit risk Settlement risk Pre-settlement risk Concentration risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHR risk Information risk Change risk Legal risk Compliance risk Tax risk Model risk Behavioural risk Fraud risk Data & processing risk (non-financial) risk\n\n## Value of the bank\n\nFinancial\n\nReputational\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe risk taxonomy ensures that all identified material risks are defined and are taken into account in the risk governance framework. It creates a common risk vocabulary, provides a/uni00A0checklist of risk types that are used in risk assessments, and helps to ensure that all material risks are managed and/uni00A0that roles and responsibilities are identified and defined. Risk taxonomy describes how materiality assessment is performed both in terms of financial and non-financial impact. Financial impact is assessed based on capital or net profit impact. Non-financial impact is determined in line with our value creation model and along the lines of the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Risk taxonomy is reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or sooner if any new material risk types emerge and require an update.\n\nThe main risk types we recognise are credit risk, market risk in the banking book, market risk in the trading book, liquidity risk, business risk and operational non-financial risk, each of which includes various sub-risk types. Risk appetite statements are set for both the main and sub-risk types. The main risk types cover all possible events that would have a direct impact on the value of the bank. This includes its financial value, but also its 'goodwill', i.e. the value of the/uni00A0bank's reputation.\n\n## Internal causal factors\n\nPeople, processes, systems, balance sheet, products, clients, reputation and behaviour\n\n## Operational\n\n1",

It is regularly evaluated and updated to ensure continuous alignment with the strategy.\n\n## Risk appetite framework\n\nb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Strategic Risk Appetite Statement expresses ABN/uni00A0AMRO's strategy of pursuing a moderate risk profile and cascades into the risk indicator framework at various levels of the organisation, allowing the bank to manage risks at every appropriate level: bank-wide (BRAS), business line (BLRAS), local (LRAS) and entity level (ERAS). The Strategic Risk Appetite Statement is approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nSenior management monitors the bank's activities, based on the risk appetite. The status of adherence to the risk appetite and the outlook are discussed monthly by the Executive Board and quarterly by the Supervisory Board, based on the Enterprise Risk Management report.\n\nThe elements of our Strategic Risk Appetite Statement ensure a coherent balance between return and value creation, supported by our client-centric business model, capital, and liquidity and funding management, while being underlined by our conduct, governance and control framework as shown in the following figure.\n\n## Strategic Risk Appetite Statement b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe risk indicator framework consists of statements set for each main and sub-risk type presented in the risk taxonomy. Each statement consists of one or more quantitative and/ or qualitative indicators, referred to as key risk indicators (KRIs). For every KRI, a limit and checkpoint is set, against which the actual risk profile is monitored. If a KRI limit is breached, action is required to bring our risk profile back within the limit. Early warning checkpoints are in place to allow for timely action to prevent breaches and/or to have a/uni00A0strategic discussion.\n\nExamples of KRIs in our risk appetite include:\n\n- H Regulatory and internal capital ratios;\n- H Risk-adjusted return measures;\n- H Concentration limits for single counterparties, sectors and countries;\n- H Economic capital and risk-weighted asset limits for various risk types;\n- H Liquidity ratios (LtD, LCR, NSFR);\n- H Market risk parameters (NII-at-Risk);\n- H Operational/non-financial risk parameters (effectiveness of internal control environment);\n- H Reputational parameters (NPS, employee engagement score).\n\nWhen setting the statements in the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement and the statements for each risk type in the risk indicator framework, the following aspects are considered: the corporate strategy, market standards (such as peer analyses), the economic environment, regulations, the views of our stakeholders and the actual risk profile, as/uni00A0well as internal insights and risk management tools.

The main conclusions of this assessment are summarised below and relate to business model, capital position, non-financial risks and balance sheet composition.\n\n## Client-centric business model and sustainable return and value creation\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO targets growth, with a focus on clients and sustainability, within the boundaries of our moderate risk profile in order to achieve a healthy long-term, risk-adjusted return. At the 2021 year-end, the bank's risk profile improved, as reflected in a lower cost of risk and a considerably smaller non-core book compared to the previous year. A number of external factors have the potential to affect the bank's current business model. The Executive Board has identified these external factors in the Management Control Statement (MCS).\n\n## Capital, liquidity & funding\n\nComfortable buffers are in place to meet capital and liquidity requirements from a regulatory and internal (i.e. economic capital) perspective. In addition, stress testing indicates that sufficient buffers are in place for times of stress.\n\n## Conduct, governance and control framework\n\nCapital buffers are also in place to cover non-financial risks. In managing these risks, we face challenges regarding our ability to fully comply with all regulatory requirements. Specific areas where the risk of non-compliance with regulations requires an ongoing and substantial effort are identified and described in the MCS at the end of this chapter.\n\nRemediation programmes - related to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF), Duty of Care and Credit Risk Management and aimed at improving ABN/uni00A0AMRO's performance - were well underway in 2021. These programmes have reduced shortcomings and aim to ensure full compliance with legislation.\n\n## Balance sheet composition\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is mainly active in the Dutch market and in international operations with a focus on Northwest Europe, where we have specific expertise and hold leading positions in selected activities.\n\n## Balance sheet composition at 31 December 2021 (in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe balance sheet composition reflects the bank's moderate risk profile. The characteristics that limit risk in the balance sheet include:\n\n- H Loan portfolio matched by deposits, long-term debt and equity;\n- H Strong focus on collateralised lending;\n- H Reducing concentration on single client exposure;\n- H Limited market risk and trading portfolios;\n- H CET1  ratio  well  above  the  regulatory  requirements so/uni00A0as/uni00A0to achieve Basel IV compliance early in the phasein period;\n- H Stable and diversified funding structure reflecting the composition of our loan book;\n- H Sufficient liquidity buffers to survive six months of severe stress.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nStrengthening our culture in the areas of risk, compliance and integrity was an important objective of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's strategy review. We place strong emphasis on sound risk/uni00A0control in our remuneration policies, which are in line with our risk profile.

This change will give clients representation at the level of the bank's highest management body.\n\n## Executive risk committees\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for setting, monitoring and reviewing the Bank's purpose, strategy, risk appetite and risk framework. The Executive Board makes a balanced assessment of the bank's commercial interests and the risks to be taken within the boundaries of the risk appetite. In the risk decision-making framework, the Executive Board\n\nis supported by three executive risk committees: the Group Risk Committee, the Group Central Credit Committee and the Group Regulatory Committee, each of which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. The mandates of the executive risk committees are summarised below.\n\n## Group Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Risk Committee (GRC) is mandated by the Executive Board to monitor, assess and manage the bank's risk profile within the approved risk appetite. The GRC monitors and approves all material risks as defined in the bank's risk taxonomy. The GRC has delegated specific approval powers to sub-committees, including Business Risk Committees for the bank's main business lines, the Financial Crime Risk Committee, the Methodology Acceptance Group, the Scenario and Stress Testing Committee, and the Impairment and Provisioning Committee.\n\n## Group Central Credit Committee\n\nThe Group Central Credit Committee (CCC) is mandated by the Executive Board to make decisions on the acceptance of credit and counterparty risk in respect of individual persons, legal persons and public administrative bodies relating to credit proposals falling within the scope of the risk appetite and limits determined by the Executive Board. In addition, the CCC is also responsible for approving and monitoring large intercompany credit facilities.\n\n## Group Regulatory Committee\n\nThe Group Regulatory Committee is mandated by the Executive Board to ensure a good understanding and adequate overview, making choices and taking decisions on matters relating to timely regulatory compliance to new and changing national and international legislation and regulations affecting the bank.\n\nFor further information on governance, please refer to the Leadership and governance chapter./uni00A0\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nThe three lines of defence model aims to clarify the relationship between risk takers and the different internal control functions, and provides clarity for all employees within the bank with regard to their risk management responsibilities.

The models for credit, operational, market, liquidity and business risk are the most widely used to measure the level of risk. They support day-to-day decision making, as well as periodic monitoring and reporting on developments in the bank's portfolios and activities. In most cases, models quantify the probability and severity of an event, i.e. the likelihood that an event will occur and the loss the bank may suffer as a consequence of that event. This information serves as the basis for ABN/uni00A0AMRO's internal measures of risk (economic capital) and as key input for calculating the minimum regulatory capital requirements according to the Basel framework (regulatory capital).\n\nNew models require approval before being implemented and used. Internal approval for the use (or continued use) of a model is obtained from the Methodology Acceptance Group (MAG), a sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee. If required, external approval is obtained from the supervisor. Supervisory approval is always required for new models and/uni00A0models that change materially due to redevelopment.\n\n## Responsible for\n\n- Setting the risk management framework and policies\n- Monitoring, reporting and escalating\n- Providing expertise and challenge to 1st line\n- Ensuring 1st line takes risk ownership\n\n## Responsible for\n\n- Evaluating the design and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes\n- Discussing with management on remediation and monitoring follow-up\n\nThe modelling departments develop models in close cooperation with the relevant business and risk experts. For/uni00A0important models, model review takes place every 3/uni00A0years, or earlier if there is a marked deterioration in performance of the model or a marked change in the risk profile of the portfolio that the model relates to. A model review includes back-testing against historical data and, where relevant, benchmarking the calibration of the models with external studies or data.\n\nThe independent model risk management department validates internal models. The model risk management framework, which includes model validation standards and procedures, ensures that models are validated independently. Model data, methodology, performance and implementation are checked according to these standards and reviewed against internal and regulatory requirements.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Capital measurement\n\n## Regulatory capital (CRD V/CRR2) b\n\nUnder the Basel framework as implemented in European legislation (CRD V and CRR2), banks are required to hold capital to cover for financial risks. As an intermediate step in determining the minimum level of capital, banks need to calculate risk-weighted assets (RWA) for three major risk types (credit, operational and market risk). The outcome of the internal models serve as input for this calculation. The capital requirements are stated as a percentage of RWA. Under Pillar 1, banks are required to hold a regulatory fixed percentage of RWA in capital. Under Pillar 2, supervisors impose a bank-specific percentage of RWA in addition to the Pillar 1 requirement.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nFor Pillar 2, we calculate economic capital (EC) in addition to regulatory required capital. Economic capital covers all risk types in our risk taxonomy for which capital is deemed to be the mitigating instrument to cover unexpected losses, and is used as the key metric for internal risk measurement and management. It is the amount of capital we reserve in order to achieve a sufficient level of protection against large unexpected losses that could result from extreme market conditions or events.\n\nInternal models are used to calculate EC at a 99.95% confidence level and a one-year time horizon. This implies that the estimated capital figure for the coming year is sufficient to cover a level of loss that will be exceeded in/uni00A0only 0.05% of all possible cases. The confidence level is/uni00A0aligned with the definition of total available financial resources (total AFR). In addition, the ratio of core AFR versus EC is monitored. Core AFR is the amount of capital that is available to cover losses on a continuity-based approach (i.e. excluding AT1, Tier 2 and senior non-preferred instruments).\n\nEC is aggregated for all risk types (without applying inter-risk diversification) to determine the total EC at a bank level and to support capital adequacy assessment, capital allocation, ex-post performance measurement and risk appetite setting, such as industry concentration risk limits.\n\n## EC quality assessment\n\nThe EC models described above form the core of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In/uni00A0order to monitor and secure the quality of the EC framework and its outcome in terms of capital adequacy, an/uni00A0EC Quality Assessment (ECQA) is performed annually as/uni00A0part of the ICAAP. For each main risk type, the calculated EC figure is evaluated in terms of risk coverage and responsiveness to internal and external developments such as in the areas of regulation and data quality. If considered necessary, an additional capital buffer ('EC add-on') is taken to cover any identified shortfalls in the EC.\n\n## Capital performance\n\nRWA and EC are also used to evaluate capital performance at a business level, as well as at transactional level in loan-pricing tools. These tools act as a decision-making mechanism for assessing the profitability of a new or existing transaction. Both ex-ante and ex-post performance are evaluated in terms of risk-adjusted return on equity (RAROE) with a risk-adjusted return on risk-adjusted capital (RARORAC) limit to safeguard sufficient risk-sensitivity. EC/uni00A0is used as an ingredient in RARORAC, whereas RWA is/uni00A0used in RAROE.\n\n## Stress testing and scenario analysis b\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO uses stress testing and scenario analysis as/uni00A0an/uni00A0important risk management instrument, looking at/uni00A0profitability, capital and liquidity from a bank-wide perspective in various scenarios on a regular basis. The stress testing framework covers both internal as well as external stress test requirements. In addition, sub-portfolio and risk type specific stress testing and scenario analysis are performed.\n\n## Stress testing purposes\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies stress testing and scenario analyses for/uni00A0several purposes, including:\n\n- H Business planning: various macroeconomic scenarios for/uni00A0budget purposes;\n- H Capital planning: stress testing is used to gain insight into the resilience of our capital under adverse changes in the economic environment and ABN/uni00A0AMRO specific circumstances;\n- H Risk appetite setting and monitoring: the outcome of stress testing is used for setting and monitoring risk appetite limits and targets, including limits under stress;\n- H Contingency planning: stress testing is used to assess and strengthen the triggers and measures in the liquidity and capital contingency and recovery plans. Reverse stress testing is performed to gain deeper insight into plausible events that could put the continuity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO under pressure;\n- H Risk type specific and business line stress testing, such as market risk trading and banking book and mortgage stress testing;\n- H Supervisory stress testing, based on prescribed scenarios and assumptions. This includes the EBA's stress test programme designed to assess banks' resilience to adverse economic or financial developments, and ECB economy-wide climate stress test aimed at evaluating the impact of alternative climate scenarios on the resilience of the bank over a time horizon of 30 years in/uni00A0the future.",

Both systemic risks (e.g. macroeconomic risks) and ABN/uni00A0AMRO specific risks (e.g. cyber attacks or adverse outcomes of legal proceedings) are considered. Scenario projections are based on quantitative models, as well as expert opinion procedures. In general, results are presented excluding and including potential mitigating actions, taking into account contingency plans. The stress testing framework also comprises the sensitivity scenarios that address various severe events on specific portfolios, countries and/or sectors, as well as the annual reverse stress test in line with regulatory requirements. Moreover, climate related risks are also covered through the/uni00A0inclusion of events related both to transition and physical risks.\n\nIn 2021, we developed a process and governance approach to incorporate climate risk scenario analysis into the bank-wide stress testing and scenario framework. This was applied in the execution of the scenario analysis in four priority portfolios: residential real estate, commercial real estate, energy and shipping. ABN/uni00A0AMRO aims to use the outcomes of these scenario analyses as input for strategic decision-making at a bank and business line level and for/uni00A0risk management purposes (e.g. risk appetite setting). The/uni00A0four analyses in the priority sectors are therefore being/uni00A0used as pilots to evaluate how to structurally integrate this approach into the bank-wide and business line/uni00A0strategy and risk management processes.\n\nGiven the importance of stress testing in terms of sound risk management, the Executive Board (previously the Executive Committee) is involved throughout the process and its governance. The Executive Board, together with the Scenario & Stress Test Committee (SSC, a sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee), discusses and decides on the scenario selection, the results and the implications.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

For non-programme lending, the lending product is customised and not subject to a product planning phase.\n\n## Credit acceptance\n\nFor a credit approval decision within programme lending, client-specific aspects and internal and external data are taken into consideration to calculate a credit score (scorecard). The credit decision is based on the outcome of/uni00A0the scorecard and policy rules.\n\nWithin non-programme lending, the credit acceptance phase of a credit proposal starts with an assessment of the proposal by the relevant business line. The qualitative and quantitative details of the credit risk associated with the loan are assessed prior to approval. Information must be provided on matters such as the purpose, details and structure of the proposed credit facility, the borrower and other counterparties, the industry and geography, management and owners, and financial and non-financial analyses.

The credit decision is based on independent assessments by both the commercial and the credit risk/uni00A0functions.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance factors\n\nWithin both programme and non-programme lending, ABN/uni00A0AMRO is taking steps to incorporate ESG factors and associated risks into its credit acceptance process for both programme lending and non-programme lending. In 2021, we performed various activities to gain deeper insight into how climate risk influences our customers. This included defining transmission channels for four strategically important portfolios. Transmission channels are the causal chains through which climate factors represent financial risks to ABN/uni00A0AMRO by directly influencing our counterparties and the assets they hold. The insights gained from defining these transmission channels will be used to adjust the credit lifecycle elements and thus integrate climate risk into/uni00A0the credit acceptance.\n\nIn addition, an implementation plan was developed to comply with regulatory expectations for climate risk management. This plan includes establishing a process for climate scenario analysis consistent with the bank's stress testing and scenario analysis framework and repeating and improving scenario analyses for the four priority portfolios/uni00A0identified. The results of these scenario analyses can be found in the Sustainability risk section.\n\n## Credit risk monitoring\n\nConsistent and regular monitoring of counterparties, exposures, risk mitigants and ongoing compliance with internal policies helps to safeguard the bank's position in relation to all risks associated with the counterparty, credit type or portfolio. Monitoring starts when the credit facility is granted and continues throughout the lifecycle of the credit facility and the relationship with the counterparty until/uni00A0the exposure is repaid and/or the limit is cancelled.\n\nIf a situation arises in which an individual counterparty shows signs of credit risk deterioration, which requires action to avoid that the credit risk evolves to a default classification, a 'watch' status is assigned. A 'watch' status indicates that a counterparty is subject to increased monitoring and appropriate follow-up measures in order to/uni00A0prevent further deterioration or a default. Indicators for this status are changes in risk profile, liquidity problems, management issues, the market outlook, a potential breach of a credit agreement, solvency issues and uncertain continuity.\n\n## Restructuring & Recovery\n\nCredit facilities that are subject to a default event are mandatorily transferred to the Financial Restructuring & Recovery department (FR&R). Credit facilities identified as/uni00A0having a significantly high risk can be transferred to FR&R if/uni00A0specialised restructuring knowledge is required. If/uni00A0a/uni00A0'going concern' approach is applicable and return to a/uni00A0performing status is considered likely, the credit facility is/uni00A0transferred to the Restructuring team, which will devise a/uni00A0plan aimed either at rehabilitation or at enhancing the/uni00A0likelihood of full repayment. In all other cases, the/uni00A0credit/uni00A0facility is transferred to the Recovery team.\n\nProgramme lending contracts are transferred to the Restructuring team if a default status is assigned because payments have been past due for more than 90 days or because another default trigger applies. If restructuring is/uni00A0ultimately ineffective, the client is transferred to other internal departments or external parties (such as Flanderijn) for debt collection.\n\nOnce a client is considered able to meet its future payment obligations and the involvement of FR&R is no longer required, the client is transferred back to the business line.\n\nFR&R plays a significant role in the execution of the bank's non-performing exposure (NPE) strategy. Policies on the management of NPE include valuation of collateral, monitoring of the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and ensuring this ratio remains well below the threshold of 5%. We have set NPE targets for each business segment and/uni00A0specific strategies for sectors with increased levels of/uni00A0non-performing loans.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Counterparty credit risk\n\nCounterparty credit risk (CCR) refers to the risk that the/uni00A0counterparty to a transaction defaults before final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. In line with the/uni00A0regulatory definition of CCR, ABN/uni00A0AMRO incurs counterparty credit risk in two business activities, firstly through over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing transactions with other financial institutions (including positions taken to manage our interest rate hedging and liquidity position) and secondly in the business of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Clearing. These two main sources of CCR are managed separately and are subject to various different features of risk management./uni00A0\n\n## Credit concentration risk b\n\nCredit concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from large exposures, relative to the bank's total risk exposure, to a single counterparty or to counterparties that are positively and highly correlated. As limiting excessive concentrations is fundamental to our credit risk strategy, we aim to keep the credit risk portfolio sufficiently granular and diversified./uni00A0To avoid excessive credit risk concentrations,/uni00A0Risk Management sets maximum levels for/uni00A0subgroups/uni00A0in the following categories:\n\n- H Single counterparty and groups of related counterparties (counterparty concentration);\n- H Countries (geographic concentration);\n- H Industries (industry concentration);\n- H Products (product concentration).\n\n## Counterparty concentration\n\nCounterparty concentration credit risk is the risk of loss arising from relatively large exposures to counterparties belonging to the same risk group. The One Obligor Exposure (OOE) is the exposure to a risk group and includes all drawn and undrawn credit facilities granted, plus all indirect exposure to the risk group, including guarantees and any other recourse claims.\n\nA risk group is an interrelated group of counterparties with/uni00A0a high degree of dependency on each other due to/uni00A0a/uni00A0control relationship. This control relationship may be/uni00A0due to direct or indirect majority interests being held by/uni00A0the/uni00A0same shareholder or group of shareholders.\n\nCounterparty credit concentration risk is measured by the/uni00A0OOE and the Economic Capital (EC) per counterparty. The bank limits its counterparty credit risk by setting OOE and EC limits. Additionally, all credit applications with an OOE and/or EC above a certain threshold are reviewed by/uni00A0the Executive Board.\n\n## Geographic concentration\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has branches and subsidiaries located outside/uni00A0the Netherlands, as well as clients who operate internationally. Consequently the bank is exposed to country risk, which is the risk of credit losses arising from/uni00A0country-specific events or circumstances. Under the new strategy for CIB announced in Q2 2020, geographical concentration continues to be relevant because we maintain a presence in multiple countries.\n\nManagement of country risk focuses on cross-border risk, which includes the risk that funds, goods or services cannot be transferred out of a country as a result of actions by local authorities in that country or other events. These risks are managed by setting country credit limits, based on individual country analyses by economic, compliance and country risk/uni00A0experts.\n\nCountry limits are reviewed at least once a year. Each country also has an internal credit rating, which is reviewed and approved twice a year and is an important factor in managing country concentration risks. As the Netherlands is our home country, it is not included in any concentration risk appetite statement or setting of credit limits.\n\n## Industry concentration\n\nIndustry concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from a/uni00A0relatively large credit exposure to counterparties active in/uni00A0a single industry. Industry concentration risk arises when deterioration in a specific industry has an effect on all credit exposures relating to that industry. ABN/uni00A0AMRO manages its industry concentrations by setting limits on economic capital (EC) for credit risk for each industry as a percentage of total EC for credit risk. In addition to the EC limits, EC concentration checkpoints are set to facilitate timely and sufficient management interventions so as to avoid limits being breached.\n\n## Product concentration\n\nProduct concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from relatively large credit exposures in a specific asset or product class. This asset or product class concentration occurs e.g. in bridge loans, leveraged loans, project finance, subordinated debt. In line with our risk appetite, ceilings are defined per product type and breaches of these concentration ceilings are managed through credit risk insurance.\n\n## Credit risk quality and impairment b\n\nWe continuously monitor the credit portfolio for signs indicating that the counterparty may become credit impaired in the future. Loans at risk are classified into different risk categories for individual counterparties and/uni00A0into days-in-arrears buckets for groups of aggregated counterparties in order to optimise the monitoring and review of these loans.",

A forborne asset is any contract that has been entered into with a counterparty who is in or about to face financial difficulty, and that has been refinanced or modified on terms and conditions that we would not have accepted if the counterparty had been financially healthy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nForbearance measures can be applied to contracts on which the counterparty has already defaulted, as well as to contracts that are still performing. If the contract is considered performing at the time the forbearance measure is taken, an assessment is made to determine whether the measure is likely to end in default. A forborne contract will cease to qualify as forborne only when all the following conditions are met:\n\n- H The contract is considered performing;\n- H A minimum probation period of at least two years has passed since the last forbearance measure and/or the date the forborne contract was considered performing (whichever is later);\n- H Regular and timely payments of more than an insignificant amount of principal or interest have been made during at least half of the probation period;\n- H The counterparty does not have any contract, within the/uni00A0credit agreement, that is more than 30 days past due/uni00A0at the end of the probation period.\n\nIf the forborne contract is or has become non-performing at/uni00A0the time of the forbearance measure, a mandatory cure/uni00A0period of at least one year applies to the contract before it is returned to performing status. The cure period starts when the contract becomes non-performing or, if/uni00A0the/uni00A0contract was already non-performing, when the last/uni00A0forbearance measure was taken./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, the definitions of non-performing and default were/uni00A0aligned. Contracts that are forborne non-performing are classified as default.\n\n## Past due credit exposures\n\nA financial asset is past due if a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual due date or if the counterparty has exceeded an agreed credit limit. ABN/uni00A0AMRO starts counting days past due from the first day that a counterparty is past due on any financial obligation.\n\n## Accounting policy for measuring allowances for/uni00A0credit losses\n\nThe IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applicable to financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At each reporting date, these financial instruments are classified into four risk stages, depending on current credit quality./uni00A0\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO recognises loss allowances based on the Expected Credit Loss model (ECL) of IFRS 9, which is designed to be forward-looking. Where necessary, management judgement is applied via a management overlay to reflect the credit risk dynamics not captured by/uni00A0our models. A management overlay is a temporary adjustment in a loss allowance until a long-term solution (e.g. model adjustment) is effective, and must be an amount commensurate to the model limitation. All overlays require a decision of the Impairment and Provision Committee (IPC). The main types of management overlays that ABN/uni00A0AMRO distinguishes are: in-model adjustments (adjustments to model parameters), post-model adjustments (adjustments to model outcomes), input data adjustments, adjustments in the weightings of macroeconomic scenarios and stage overrides.\n\n1",

Subsequently, the cumulative changes in lifetime ECLs since initial recognition, which are discounted at the\n\ncredit-adjusted effective interest rate, are recognised in/uni00A0the/uni00A0profit or loss statement as an impairment gain or/uni00A0loss, and presented under Impairment charges on financial instruments.

For this reason, POCI/uni00A0stage is not included in/uni00A0the following figure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Classification in stage 2\n\nWe use quantitative and qualitative stage triggers to determine whether a financial instrument should be classified as stage 1 or stage 2.\n\n## Quantitative stage triggers\n\nThe key quantitative metric that determines when a financial instrument is transferred from stage 1 to stage 2 is the deterioration in the lifetime probability of default (LPD) from the date of origination to the reporting date, based on internal data. The LPD represents the likelihood that a counterparty will default during the lifetime of the financial instrument and depends on credit risk drivers such as:\n\n- H Product characteristics (e.g. repayment and interest terms, term of the product);\n- H The financial condition of the borrower;\n- H The number of days past due;\n- H Expected developments in the economy.\n\nThe lifetime PD deterioration (LPDD) measures the relative difference between the remaining lifetime PD at/uni00A0reporting (LPDR) and the remaining lifetime PD at origination (LPDO) as LPDD = LPDR/LPDO. If the LPD\n\ndeterioration of an exposure is above a predefined threshold, the LPD is considered to be significantly deteriorated. The exposure is/uni00A0then transferred to stage 2 and impairment allowances equal to the lifetime expected credit loss are recognised. If/uni00A0the LPD deterioration subsequently reduces and falls below the threshold, the client is transferred back to stage/uni00A01. When determining the thresholds, ABN/uni00A0AMRO distinguishes between various portfolios within consumer lending, residential mortgages and corporate loans. A/uni00A0specific threshold is calculated for each portfolio, based/uni00A0on/uni00A0a statistical method. Due to limitations in the availability of historical data, ABN AMRO currently uses the 12-month PD as proxy for LPD for corporate loans and part of consumer lending.\n\nWe consider deterioration in the 12-month PD to be appropriately representative of LPD deterioration for the portfolios where the LPD is not available. The following table shows LPD deterioration thresholds that trigger transfers to stage 2 as at 31 December 2021. The table provides ranges, as each product class uses multiple ECL models and thresholds are determined for each ECL/uni00A0model.",

ABN/uni00A0AMRO assigns the watch status to counterparties with an increased credit/uni00A0risk. This process allows for intensive monitoring, early detection of deterioration in the credit portfolio and/uni00A0appropriate follow-up measures;\n- H A delinquency-based regulatory backstop is in place, such that the credit risk of financial assets that are more than 30 days past due will be assumed to have significantly increased.\n\n## Reclassification to stage 1\n\nAs a general rule, favourable changes in credit risk are recognised consistently with unfavourable changes, and/uni00A0a financial instrument is transferred back to stage 1 if/uni00A0quantitative or qualitative triggers are no longer met. In/uni00A0some cases, a probation period applies:\n\n- H Forborne financial instruments are transferred back from stage 2 to stage 1 only after a probation period of at least two years has ended, in line with the ABN/uni00A0AMRO forbearance policy. Stage 3 forborne instruments transfer back to stage 2 after a cure period of at least one year;\n- H For financial instruments that are 30 days past due, a three-month probation period is applied for transfers from stage 2 to stage 1.\n\n## Classification in stage 3\n\nA transfer to stage 3 will always be the result of the default of a financial instrument. Our definitions of default and impaired are aligned and comply with the/uni00A0EBA guidelines on the application of the definition of/uni00A0default.\n\nAll models use a consistent definition of default, which has been specified in line with regulations. A default is/uni00A0deemed to have occurred when:\n\n- H the counterparty is past due by more than 90 days on any material financial credit obligation to the bank; or\n- H the bank considers the borrower to be unlikely to/uni00A0meet its contractual obligations (unlikely-to-pay or/uni00A0UTP).\n\nThe materiality of a financial obligation past due is assessed against an absolute and a relative threshold, in line with regulatory standards. To determine unlikeliness to pay, the bank has specified both mandatory default triggers (always resulting in the assignment of a default status, whereby no/uni00A0additional expert judgment is allowed) and judgmental triggers (requiring an assessment by credit risk managers to/uni00A0determine whether the UTP indications should result in/uni00A0a/uni00A0default classification).\n\nIn 2021, a distressed debt restructuring (forbearance) of the/uni00A0credit facility, which is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation, was added as a mandatory trigger. As/uni00A0a/uni00A0result, the definitions of non-performing and default are now aligned.\n\n## Reclassification to stage 2\n\nThe default classification for non-forborne exposures ends when the default triggers no longer apply and a (probation) cure period of at least three months has passed since the default trigger was last applied. For/uni00A0forborne exposures, a twelve-month cure period starts from the moment the last forbearance measure or/uni00A0default trigger was applied. After the cure period, an/uni00A0assessment is performed to establish whether the/uni00A0improvement in the credit quality is factual and/uni00A0permanent (including, for example, no remaining past due amounts).\n\n1",

ABN/uni00A0AMRO distinguishes between two types of calculation methods for/uni00A0credit loss allowances:\n\n- H Individual Lifetime ECL (LECL) for credit-impaired (stage/uni00A03) financial instruments with exposures above EUR/uni00A03/uni00A0million;\n- H Collective 12-month ECL (stage 1) and LECL (stage 2 and/uni00A03) for financial instruments that have similar credit/uni00A0risk characteristics (e.g. residential mortgages, consumer loans and SME loans) are clustered in portfolios and collectively assessed for impairment losses. A collective impairment calculation approach based on individual parameters is also applied to stage 3 exposures below EUR/uni00A03/uni00A0million. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has models to quantify the Probability of Loss (PL), Loss Given Loss (LGL) and Exposure at Loss (EAL) for/uni00A0the purpose of calculating the/uni00A0collective 12-month ECL and LECL for these financial/uni00A0instruments./uni00A0\n\n## Lifetime expected credit loss\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO defines the lifetime of credit as the maximum contractual period during which the bank is exposed to credit risk; we do not apply a longer period, even if that longer period is consistent with business practice. For some contracts, such as overdraft facilities or credit cards, no end date is specified or amounts can be contractually withdrawn by the lender at short notice. In these cases, ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses behavioural maturity models that rely on historical client behaviour to determine future expected exposures.\n\n## Forward-looking information\n\nFor expected credit loss calculations, ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses/uni00A0three different scenarios of future economic developments: a baseline (or most likely) scenario, a/uni00A0negative scenario and a positive scenario.\n\nThe three scenarios are incorporated into the expected credit loss calculation and risk stage determination in a probability-weighted manner. In order to incorporate the latest economic outlook (including the macroeconomic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic), the scenarios and their weights are reviewed each quarter and adjusted if necessary. Details of the scenarios and their weights used in the reporting period can be found in Credit risk in the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\nThe baseline scenario is based on Group Economics' regular macroeconomic forecasts and is reviewed at each reporting date. The Group Economics analysts consider a range of external sources in order to develop the forecasts for the different macroeconomic variables (MEVs) required, including GDP, the unemployment rate, the housing price index, oil prices and/uni00A03-month EURIBOR. They check their views and assumptions against external views and assumptions. The preliminary forecasts for the different countries undergo a challenge process to ensure they are reasonable and consistent. To/uni00A0reduce the risk of biased forecasts, the final MEVs are/uni00A0again checked against external forecasts and then submitted to the Scenario and Stress Testing Committee for approval.\n\nBoth alternative scenarios reflect the lower and upper levels for the different macroeconomic variables,",

For most MEVs, Group/uni00A0Economics uses its standard deviations. These are/uni00A0calculated on the basis of/uni00A0figures realised in the past few decades. The extent to which MEVs actually deviate from their historical means over time reflects the past materialisation of negative and positive risks in the economy. A probability of about 85% roughly corresponds to a standard deviation of plus and minus one and a half.\n\nFor the purpose of scenario analysis, the forecast period is five years. It is assumed that MEVs gradually move to their potential or equilibrium values after the forecasting period. For each specific portfolio, a selection of variables is made for calculating the expected credit loss, based on statistical relevance and expert judgement.\n\n## Cured financial assets\n\nWhen a credit impaired financial asset cures, the interest that was previously unrecognised is reported as an impairment release in the impairment charge rather than/uni00A0as/uni00A0a credit to the interest income calculated using the/uni00A0effective interest method.\n\n## Write-off\n\n- H For non-programme lending, a write-off must be taken if all possible means of recovery have been exhausted and it has become clear that there is a low probability of/uni00A0recovering the debt, either in part or full.\n\n- H Most of the programme lending facilities are automatically written-off after 1,080 days in default.\n\nSuch loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of/uni00A0the/uni00A0loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to impairment charges on financial instruments in the income statement.\n\n## Credit risk measurement b\n\nThe models used for the measurement and management of/uni00A0credit risk vary from purely statistical to expert-based models and employ both quantitative and qualitative risk drivers. All models are subject to the bank's model risk management framework. They undergo initial validation by/uni00A0the independent model validation function before their first use, and annually thereafter. Independent validation is also required when a model undergoes a material change./uni00A0\n\n## Probability of default\n\nThe Probability of Default (PD) indicates the likelihood that/uni00A0a/uni00A0counterparty or exposure defaults within a one-year time horizon. For the non-programme lending portfolio, the/uni00A0model score is mapped to and expressed as an internal uniform counterparty rating (UCR). The UCR rating scale consists of 14 performing ratings, each representing a fixed PD range. The indicative mapping of the internal UCR rating scale to external rating agency ratings is shown in the following table.\n\n## Internal rating scale mapped to external ratings b\n\n| Grade Category       | UCR   (internal rating)   | Low  PD%   | Mid  PD%   | High  PD%   | Standard & Poor's  equivalent   | Moody's   equivalent   | Fitch   equivalent   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Investment grade     | UCR 1                     | 0.000      | 0.03       | 0.035       | AAA to A+                       | Aaa to Aa3             | AAA to AA-           |\n|                      | UCR 2+                    | 0.035      | 0.04       | 0.045       | A+                              | A1                     | AA-                  |\n|                      | UCR 2                     | 0.045      | 0.05       | 0.070       | A                               | A1                     | A+                   |\n|                      | UCR 2-                    | 0.070      | 0.10       | 0.130       | A-                              | A3                     | A-                   |\n|                      | UCR 3+                    | 0.130      | 0.16       | 0.200       | BBB+                            | Baa1                   | BBB+                 |\n|                      | UCR 3                     | 0.200      | 0.25       | 0.300       | BBB                             | Baa2                   | BBB                  |\n|                      | UCR 3-                    | 0.300      | 0.36       | 0.470       | BBB-                            | Baa3                   | BBB-                 |\n| Sub-investment grade | UCR 4+                    | 0.470      | 0.60       | 0.780       | BB+                             | Ba1                    | BB+                  |\n|                      | UCR 4                     | 0.780      | 1.0 0      | 1.290       | BB                              | Ba2                    | BB                   |\n|                      | UCR 4-                    | 1.290      | 1.65       | 2.230       | BB-                             | B1                     | BB-                  |\n|                      | UCR 5+                    | 2.230      | 3.00       | 4.240       | B+                              | B2                     | B                    |\n|                      | UCR 5                     | 4.240      | 6.00       | 8.490       | B-                              | Caa1                   | B-                   |\n|                      | UCR 5-                    | 8.490      | 12.00      | 16.970      | CCC/C                           | Caa2                   | CCC/C                |\n|                      | UCR 6+                    | 16.970     | 24.00      | 100.00      | CCC/C                           | Caa-C                  | CCC/C                |\n| Default              | UCR 6-8                   |            |            |             | D                               | D                      | D                    |\n\n## Rating assignment\n\nFor non-programme lending, the ratings are individually assigned to each counterparty (PD) and facility (LGD) by the business account manager (first line) and approved by credit\n\nrisk (second line). For programme lending, exposures ratings are not assigned individually but assigned to pools with similar characteristics. For all exposures, the EAD\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

        "page_content": "estimation is assigned automatically based on the facility type and the undrawn part of the facility.\n\n## Loss given default\n\nLoss Given Default (LGD) models estimate the amount the/uni00A0bank would lose if the counterparty were to default. LGD is expressed as a percentage of the outstanding amount at default. For credit facilities that are not in default, LGD estimates are influenced by the risk mitigating techniques used by the bank (such as collateral coverage and/or third party protection), the credit facility's seniority and structure, and the bank's view of the creditorfriendliness of the relevant country's legal framework.\n\n## Exposure at default\n\nExposure at Default (EAD) models estimate the expected exposure at the time a counterparty defaults. If all or a part/uni00A0of a facility is undrawn (i.e. the outstanding amount is/uni00A0less than the approved limit) at the time of the EAD calculation, a portion of the undrawn amount is added to/uni00A0the exposure to reflect the tendency of counterparties to/uni00A0utilise larger portions of their approved credit facilities when nearing default.\n\n## Capital for credit risk Regulatory capital\n\nFor the purpose of determining capital requirements for credit risk, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies the Advanced Internal Rating Based (A-IRB) approach to the vast majority of its portfolio. Under this approach, the previously described internal estimates for PD, EAD and LGD are used to calculate Credit Risk RWA. For a number of smaller portfolios, RWA is determined according to the Standardised Approach (SA). This approach prescribes the risk weights to be applied to the exposure value in order to calculate RWA.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nThe EC model for credit risk uses a Monte Carlo simulation to determine a full portfolio loss distribution, taking into account specific portfolio characteristics and diversification effects. Loan facilities are valued on an economic value (mark-to-market) basis to ensure that loss estimates can be/uni00A0based not only on defaulting borrowers, but also on possible credit migrations and changes associated with the/uni00A0market values of loans.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation\n\nCredit risk mitigation techniques are used by the bank to reduce the credit risk associated with its credit exposures. Such techniques relate mainly to collateral management and guarantees, offsetting financial assets and liabilities, and enforcing master netting agreements or similar instruments.\n\nCredit risk mitigation techniques themselves entail risks and, as such, have to meet certain requirements so they can be used effectively and in line with the bank's risk appetite. For this reason, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has established mandatory, bank-wide policies governing the use and management of credit risk mitigation techniques. These are in line with regulatory requirements, as well as the needs of the bank and its clients. These bank-wide policies provide the overarching rules to be met by business-specific procedures and processes related to credit risk mitigation.\n\n## Collateral management and guarantees\n\nCollateral and guarantees represent assets with material value that have been received by (or pledged to) the bank to secure obligations under a credit facility or other exposure. To be effective, such security must give the bank the right to appropriate and liquidate collateral on time and without impediment so that losses on the exposure at default are/uni00A0minimised.\n\nIn addition to minimising exposure risk, eligible collateral and guarantees can also reduce the regulatory and economic capital the bank is required to hold as a buffer for unexpected losses. The Capital Requirements Regulation prescribes the/uni00A0criteria that collateral must meet to become eligible for/uni00A0capital reduction. These criteria, which provide for legal/uni00A0effectiveness and for the enforceability, valuation and/uni00A0monitoring of collateral, are aimed at the effective and/uni00A0timely realisation of collateral.\n\n## Accounting policy for offsetting financial assets and/uni00A0liabilities b\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported on the EU IFRS balance sheet, if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention either to settle on a net basis or to/uni00A0realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The bank applies netting to debtor and creditor balances, such as current accounts, where offsetting is justified by formal agreement with the client, provided they meet the applicable criteria.\n\n## Accounting policy for enforceable master netting agreements or similar instruments b\n\nEnforceable master netting arrangements take into account all agreements containing conditions that allow offsetting in the event of default. In addition, agreements are enforceable if the bank has a legally enforceable right to offset and no/uni00A0ability and/or intention to realise the asset and settle the/uni00A0liability simultaneously. These arrangements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements and global master securities lending agreements.",

The two primary relief measures offered have been deferral of interest and principal payments, and Covid-19-related credit facilities supported by public guarantee schemes.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO continuously monitors sectors vulnerable to Covid-19 and offers tailored support to clients with a viable business or financial case.\n\n## Payment moratoria and other Covid-19-related forbearance measures b\n\nBy 31 December 2021, approximately 68,500 clients had/uni00A0received a Covid-19-related deferral or forbearance measure, accounting for total exposure of EUR 19.2 billion (31 December 2020: EUR 22.6 billion). The reduction in the number of clients is significant since a large portion of loans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwere due for repayment on 31 December 2021. Moreover, the larger part of the deferral or forbearance measures had expired by 31 December 2021. An amount of EUR 953 million was subject to measures that were still active./uni00A0The active measures relate to loans where the deferral is still applicable (has not yet expired), such as loans with Covid-19-related forbearance measures. Loans that previously received a payment moratoria or other Covid-19-related forbearance measure where the moratorium/deferral has ended are reported as expired.\n\nCredit quality remained broadly stable due to the large-scale government support schemes and the improved economic outlook. The decrease in stage 2 and 3 exposure was limited, leaving the total share of exposure with increased risk relatively unchanged at 46% of the total exposure subject to Covid-19-related measures (31 December 2020: 47%).\n\nBy 31 December 2021, 75% of the originally deferred payments within Commercial Banking had been repaid (31/uni00A0December 2020: 47%). The remaining deferrals amounted to EUR/uni00A00.4/uni00A0billion. The reduction was in line with/uni00A0our expectations regarding contractual repayments due on 31/uni00A0December 2021 for current account and overdraft facilities and due on the contractual maturity date for term loans.

The decline in EAD in the investment grade portfolio is visible in the exposure classes of retail and institutions and was partly offset by increases in corporates, driven by higher business activity in CIB core and Commercial Banking, and in central governments and central banks. The impaired portfolio decreased in corporates, primarily due to the reduction in the CIB non-core loan book./uni00A0In 2021, EAD under the Standardised Approach increased, predominantly due to business developments in Clearing and as a result of the implementation of the Standardised Approach for counterparty credit risk in Global Markets.\n\n## Credit quality by internal rating scale mapped to stages b\n\nThe following table presents the gross carrying amount of/uni00A0loans and the contractual amount of undrawn loan commitments, classified by internal rating and risk stage. In/uni00A0order to classify a client as stage 2, several qualitative triggers are needed, which are not necessarily dependent on internal ratings. Reference is made to the Credit risk management section for more information on internal ratings and stage determination.\n\n1",

Stage 2 clients are primarily in the medium internal UCRs, primarily visible in corporate and off-balance sheet loans. Compared to 2020, the share of the portfolio with an investment grade rating (UCR 1 to UCR 3) decreased marginally, mainly due to a higher amount of subinvestment grade mortgage loans, resulting from implementation of credit risk models based on the new definition of default (DoD). Approximately 3% of the bank's portfolio is reported in UCR 6+, which is the highest risk class for performing loans, but also the default value if the rating has expired and/uni00A0a new rating is not yet available.\n\n## Geographic concentration by EAD\n\nb\n\n|                                           | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions, Exposure at Default) | The Netherlands    | Rest of Europe     | USA                | Asia               | Rest of the world  | Total              |\n| Central governments and central banks     | 70,875             | 22,219             | 6,659              | 2,156              | 1,243              | 103,152            |\n| Institutions 1                            | 1,077              | 4,514              | 675                | 198                | 570                | 7,034              |\n| Corporates                                | 69,464             | 26,236             | 2,457              | 792                | 4,304              | 103,254            |\n| Retail                                    | 168,956            | 453                | 37                 | 57                 | 41                 | 169,544            |\n| -

EUR/uni00A012.9/uni00A0billion). This movement related mainly to the CIB non-core wind-down and was reflected in lower forborne corporate loans. The amount of total forborne assets is still substantial, especially in the case of residential mortgages and corporate loans, due to the high inflow in 2020 caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and developments in the oil price.\n\nThe forborne portfolio of residential mortgages decreased in 2021 by EUR/uni00A00.3/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A03.1/uni00A0billion. As the main part of this portfolio consists of loans to which a collective payment deferral was applied in 2020, these loans are expected to cease to be forborne during the coming year. Forborne exposure of corporate loans decreased by EUR/uni00A01.4/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A07.9/uni00A0billion, mainly owing to repayments and to the sale of assets as part of the CIB non-core wind-down.",

While the past due ratio for residential/uni00A0mortgages remained stable at 0.6%, the past due ratios for corporate loans and consumer loans went down from 1.6% to 1.2% and from 2.9% to 1.7%, respectively.

In/uni00A0the corporate loans segment, declines in arrears of Asset-Based Finance clients more than offsett the rise in arrears of Commercial Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking clients, particularly in the short-term bucket. Furthermore, a significant part of the rise in short-term corporate loan arrears was short-lived, given that the relevant clients returned to current status in January 2022.\n\n31 December 2020\n\n1",

Due to the immateriality of the amount, this is included in the amount shown for stage 3 throughout this report.\n\n## Exposure and impairment flows b\n\nThis section provides more details on the exposure and impairment flows underlying the change in coverage and stage ratios shown in the previous section.\n\n## Total loans and advances b\n\n|                                             | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                        | Stage 1     | Stage 2     | Stage 3 3   | Total       | Stage 1     | Stage 2     | Stage 3 3   | Total       |\n| Balance at 1 January                        | 220,705     | 25,602      | 8,474       | 254,781     | 246,631     | 17,066      | 6,740       | 270,437     |\n| Transfer to stage 1                         | 5,607       | -5,517      | -90         |             | 5,250       | -5,202      | -48         |             |\n| Transfer to stage 2                         | -7,863      | 8,412       | -549        |             | -18,455     | 19,122      | -667        |             |\n| Transfer to stage 3                         | -890        | -1,432      | 2,322       |             | -2,451      | -2,140      | 4,591       |             |\n| Additional drawdowns and partial repayments | -20,683     | 1,029       | 11          | -19,643     | -11,199     | 1,110       | 797         | -9,292      |\n| Originated or purchased                     | 71,356      |             |             | 71,356      | 35,887      |             |             | 35,887      |\n| Matured or repaid                           | -36,312     | -7,148      | -2,538      | -45,998     | -32,568     | -4,035      | -1,521      | -38,123     |\n| Write-offs                                  | - 11        | -19         | -1,087      | -1,117      |             |             | -1,194      | -1,194      |\n| Foreign exchange                            | 1,774       | 281         | 159         | 2,214       | -2,385      | -289        | -209        | -2,883      |\n| Other movements                             | -145        | -24         | -1          | -171        | -6          | -29         | -15         | -51         |\n| Balance at 31 December                      | 233,537     | 21,183      | 6,701       | 261,421     | 220,705     | 25,602      | 8,474       | 254,781     |\n\n- 1 Excluding loans at fair value through P&L.\n- 2 Gross carrying amount excludes fair value adjustments from hedge accounting.\n- 3 Including POCI.\n\nTotal loans and advances increased compared to 31/uni00A0December 2020, mainly due to an increase in other loans as a result of increased margin contributions to Eurex and European Commodity Clearing (ECC) for Clearing clients (EUR/uni00A09.1/uni00A0billion) and to Commercial Banking (EUR/uni00A01.8/uni00A0billion) as a result of new client lending relating to/uni00A0TLTRO, which was drawn largely in November and December. The increase was off-set by a decrease in CIB/uni00A0(EUR/uni00A0-2.7/uni00A0billion) and Markets (EUR/uni00A0-1.3/uni00A0billion), which was visible mostly in corporate loans and is explained by the strategy review to wind down CIB activities outside Northwest Europe and by a net decrease in derivatives as/uni00A0a/uni00A0result of fair value changes, respectively.\n\nNew client lending in the context of TLTRO also impacted on the observed increase in originated or purchased loans/uni00A0(EUR/uni00A035.5/uni00A0billion) and additional drawdowns (EUR/uni00A0-10.4/uni00A0billion), mainly visible in corporate loans. The/uni00A0remainder of the increase in originated or purchased loans is explained by new mortgage production.\n\nExposure flows per product class are presented in the section Additional risk, funding & capital disclosures.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

Releases were attributable to a more favourable economic scenario during the year, partly offset by additions from management overlays. Additions for individual files classified in stage 3 during 2021 were limited. Additions for existing stage 3 files were attributable to the oil and gas and energy-offshore sectors in CIB.\n\nA release of EUR/uni00A037/uni00A0million was recorded for CIB in 2021, while an increase in impairment charges of EUR/uni00A01,659/uni00A0million was recorded in 2020. In 2020, three exceptional client files contributed EUR/uni00A0629/uni00A0million, while the other impairment charges were attributable to additions from individual files in the oil and gas and energy-offshore sectors. The CIB wind-down continued in 2021, resulting in a large outflow of exposure and the release of associated impairments in our CIB non-core portfolio. In addition, a more favourable economic scenario compared to the insights in Q4 2020 led to releases in impairments. Inflows from individual files were limited in 2021, but additions on existing files were recorded in the oil and gas and energy-offshore sectors.\n\nAdditions for Commercial Banking amounted to EUR/uni00A041/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0542/uni00A0million) and were attributable to management overlays, including one for stage 3 collateralised loans and one for vulnerable sectors. The net impact on individual files resulted in a small release, mainly contributed to by the food sector and offset by additions for several sectors.\n\nFor residential mortgages, a release of EUR/uni00A046/uni00A0million was recorded in 2021, compared to a release of EUR/uni00A018/uni00A0million in 2020. The main contributor was the improvement in the economic outlook during the year as the Dutch economy recovered more quickly than had been expected at the end of 2020. This, together with an improved risk perception and decreasing volumes in our mortgages portfolio, resulted in a release of impairments in 2021.\n\nBased on an expected loss analysis of the current and projected portfolio, including the wind-down of CIB/uni00A0noncore, we revised our long-term expectations of the cost of/uni00A0risk from 25-30bps to around 20bps.\n\n1",

These impairments included expected credit losses (ECL) as calculated by our IFRS 9 models and the management overlays we recorded. The ECL is calculated taking into account a probabilityweighted average of three economic scenarios. As the ECL model outcomes do not always reflect the current economic environment and circumstances, additional management overlays are applied to incorporate potential risks not fully captured by the model outcomes. During 2021, management overlays increased by EUR/uni00A0134/uni00A0million, rising to a total of EUR/uni00A0424/uni00A0million at the year-end (EUR/uni00A0290/uni00A0million at 31 December 2020). These were mainly recorded for risks in the corporate loans portfolios, which increased by EUR/uni00A0110/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0354/uni00A0million and comprised the following:\n\n- H In the first half of 2021, an overlay was recorded for clients in vulnerable sectors within Commercial Banking to reflect the risk of loans in these sectors until borrowers' updated financial information has been reviewed.\n- H Government support had a positive effect on clients' payment behaviour and led to an all-time low number of bankruptcies. An overlay taken in 2020 for Commercial Banking clients, to capture any credit risk deterioration that can be expected after government support measures end, was maintained and extended to our/uni00A0CIB/uni00A0portfolio in H1 2021.\n- H The existing overlay for the CIB non-core portfolio, which/uni00A0covers anticipated additional risk costs relating to/uni00A0the wind-down, decreased over the year, in line with the decreasing exposure of this portfolio.\n- H In H2 2021, an overlay for collateralised loans/uni00A0in stage 3 was recorded for Commercial Banking.",

A/uni00A0management overlay to cover the refinancing risk of interest-only mortgages was maintained.\n\nThe management overlays within consumer lending portfolios increased by EUR/uni00A014/uni00A0million owing to the overlay taken for tail risk in the wind-down of a retail banking portfolio.\n\nAll management overlays represent best estimates of the/uni00A0risks involved.

Relevant experience related to the impact of Covid-19 on the model outcomes will be used to improve the models over time and reduce the management overlays.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios in 2021 b\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)   | Weight   | Macroeconomic variable   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024      | 2025   | Unweighted  ECL 4   | Weighted  ECL 4   |\n|------------------------|----------|--------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|\n|                        |          | Real GDP Netherlands 1   | 4.5%   | 2.9%   | 2.5%      | 1.6%   |                     |                   |\n| Positive               | 10%      | Unemployment 2           | 2.7%   | 2.3%   | 2.3% 2.2% |        | 495                 |                   |\n|                        |          | House price index 3      | 12.5%  | 5.0%   | 3.5%      | 3.0%   |                     |                   |\n|                        |          | Real GDP Netherlands     | 3.8%   | 2.4%   | 2.0%      | 1.4%   |                     |                   |\n| Baseline               | 60%      | Unemployment             | 3.1%   | 2.8%   | 2.8%      | 2.8%   | 510                 | 533               |\n|                        |          | House price index        | 10.0%  | 4.0%   | 3.0%      | 3.0%   |                     |                   |\n|                        |          | Real GDP Netherlands     | 2.7%   | 0.7%   | 2.3%      | 1.6%   |                     |                   |\n| Negative               | 30%      | Unemployment             | 4.0%   | 4.2%   | 3.4%      | 3.2%   | 591                 |                   |\n|                        |          | House price index        | 0.0%   | -7.5%  | -10.0%    | -2.5%  |                     |                   |\n\n- 1 Real GDP Netherlands, % change year-on-year.\n- 2 Unemployment Netherlands, % of labour force.\n- 3 House price index Netherlands - average % change year-on-year.\n- 4 Excluding ECL for stage 3 and POCI.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios in 2020 b\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)   | Weight               | Macroeconomic variable   | 2021   | 2022      | 2023   | 2024   | Unweighted  ECL 4   | Weighted  ECL 4   |\n|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|\n|                        | Real GDP Netherlands | 1 4.4%                   |        | 4.3%      | 2.0%   | 1.7%   |                     |                   |\n| Positive               | 10% Unemployment     | 2                        | 6.2%   | 6.2% 5.6% | 4.8%   |        | 653                 |                   |\n|                        | House price index    | 3 5.0%                   | 3.0%   | 2.0%      |        | 3.0%   |                     |                   |\n|                        | Real GDP Netherlands |                          | 3.0%   | 3.6%      | 2.3%   | 1.8%   |                     |                   |\n| Baseline               | 50% Unemployment     |                          | 6.4%   | 7.9%      | 6.9%   | 6.1%   | 688                 | 703               |\n|                        | House price index    |                          | 0.0%   | 0.0%      | 2.0%   | 3.0%   |                     |                   |\n|                        | Real GDP Netherlands |                          | 0.7%   | 3.0%      | 1.0%   | 1.4%   |                     |                   |\n| Negative               | 40% Unemployment     |                          | 6.8%   | 8.4%      | 7.8%   | 6.8%   | 734                 |                   |\n|                        |                      | House price index        | -3.0%  | -5.0%     | 0.0%   | 3.0%   |                     |                   |\n\n- 1 Real GDP Netherlands, % change year-on-year.\n- 2 Unemployment Netherlands, % of labour force.\n- 3 House price index Netherlands - average % change year-on-year.\n- 4 Excluding ECL for stage 3 and POCI.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios and ECL sensitivity/uni00A0\n\nThe tables below show the scenarios used for calculating the expected credit loss (ECL) at 31 December 2021 and/uni00A031/uni00A0December 2020. At the end of 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO economists increased their 2021 eurozone and Dutch growth forecasts upwards, based on the stronger economic recovery and supported by a quicker than expected rebound in global trade, continued fiscal and monetary support from governments, low unemployment and the continued rise in residential real estate prices in the Netherlands. Inflationary pressures linked to energy prices and supply disruptions are/uni00A0expected to be limited to the first half of 2022. The resilience of the Dutch economy to successive lockdowns is positively noted as a risk-mitigating factor for the year ahead. On the back of these favourable economic conditions, the weight of the negative scenario was reduced from 40% to 30%.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

The decline in forborne exposures in the Netherlands also reflects residential mortgages that were repaid or ceased to be forborne. Stage 3 exposures and allowances in the Netherlands decreased due to a decline in Commercial Banking, mostly as a result of repayments. Contrary to the general declining trend, arrears in the USA rose by EUR/uni00A064/uni00A0million owing to a single client. The respective client returned to current status in January 2022.",

The decrease in stage 3 exposures in industrial goods and services, food and beverage, healthcare and real estate was also related, albeit/uni00A0to a lesser extent, to the decrease in corporate loans/uni00A0in Commercial Banking, mostly due to repayments. Compared to the previous year, the largest declines in arrears were in the private individuals and retail sectors, offset by an increase in arrears in financial services.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation b\n\nCollateral reporting is based on the net collateral value (NCV). The NCV represents the amount expected to be recovered from the collateral pledged to the bank if the client defaults. Where necessary, certain discounts are applied. The NCV is approached by an average recovery rate observed for the specific type of collateral and, where applicable, by applying haircuts, for example in the event of/uni00A0currency mismatches. Surplus collateral is the amount of/uni00A0over-collateralisation, calculated on an individual basis. A/uni00A0surplus is not included for guarantees as the debtor cannot be held liable for more than the maximum debt.\n\n31 December 2020",

applicable.\n- 3 Collateral in the column Master netting agreement is mainly markets related and consists of master netting agreements which also includes cash collateral as part of these agreements. Cash collateral not part of master netting agreements has been reported under the column Financial instruments.\n- 4 Surplus collateral is the amount of over-collateralisation, calculated on an individual basis.\n- 5 Net exposure represents the portfolio corrected for the surplus amount and gives a view on the potential shortfall in collateral on the total portfolio.\n\nExcept for residential mortgages, total risk mitigation decreased. The main reason for the increase in property and/uni00A0equipment for residential mortgages was indexation attributable to the tight housing market. As a result, surplus collateral also increased. For consumer loans, the decrease in total risk mitigation was mainly the result of a more conservative collateral reporting approach in Germany. This/uni00A0did not affect net exposure, which decreased in line with the portfolio. The decline in total risk mitigation for corporate loans was evidenced by a decline in property and equipment, as well as in other collateral and guarantees. This was mainly driven by the exit of clients in line with\n\nthe/uni00A0wind-down of CIB non-core.\n\nThe total net exposure of loans and advances customers increased to EUR/uni00A053.2/uni00A0billion in 2021 (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A042.0/uni00A0billion). This was primarily driven by other loans and advances and related to Clearing activities (i.e. posting cash collateral and default fund contributions). The increase in net exposure of corporate loans was related to new client lending in the context of TLTRO.\n\n31 December 2020",

1 Carrying amount includes loan impairment allowances where applicable.\n- 2 Collateral in the column Master netting agreement is mainly markets related and consists of master netting agreements which also includes cash collateral as part of these agreements. Cash/uni00A0collateral not part of master netting agreements has been reported under the column Financial instruments.\n- 3 Surplus collateral is the amount of over-collateralisation, calculated on an individual basis.\n- 4 Net exposure represents the portfolio corrected for the surplus amount and gives a view on the potential shortfall in collateral on the total portfolio.\n\nIn line with the decrease in the stage 3 carrying amount to/uni00A0EUR/uni00A04.8/uni00A0billion (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A05.7/uni00A0billion), total risk mitigation decreased to EUR/uni00A05.4/uni00A0billion in 2021 (31/uni00A0December 2020: EUR/uni00A06.1/uni00A0billion). This decrease was mainly observed in property and equipment and, to a lesser extent, in financial instruments and other collateral and guarantees. The decline in property and equipment for corporate loans was partly offset by an increase for residential mortgages due to indexation. The main reason why other collateral and guarantees decreased was lower intangibles and other non-financial collateral from CIB clients in the United States. Financial instruments in corporate loans recorded lower collateral in the form\n\nof/uni00A0receivables from Commercial Banking and CIB clients. As/uni00A0the decrease in the stage 3 portfolio (including POCI) exceeded the decline in total risk mitigation, net exposure decreased by EUR/uni00A0100/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0735/uni00A0million at 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\nDuring 2021 ABN/uni00A0AMRO obtained property and equipment by taking possession of collateral held as security for loans and advances. The total amount of such assets held on 31/uni00A0December 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A04/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A03/uni00A0million). ABN/uni00A0AMRO does not intend to use these assets in its operations and will pursue timely and orderly realisation of the collateral.\n\n1",

Despite these low interest rates, cost levels for home buyers were pushed up by the high property prices.\n\nThe housing price index published by Statistics Netherlands (CBS) at the end of 2021 was 20.3% higher than at the end of 2020. According to the Dutch Land Registry (Kadaster), the number of transactions in the Dutch housing market in 2021 was 4.0% lower than in 2020, and 6.5% lower than the peak in 2017.\n\n## Residential mortgage indicators\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                                        | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Gross carrying amount excluding fair value adjustment from hedge accounting                 | 146,351            | 145,672            |\n| - of which Nationale Hypotheek Garantie (NHG)                                               | 31,557             | 33,367             |\n| Fair value adjustment from hedge accounting                                                 | 1,442              | 3,186              |\n| Carrying amount excluding fair value adjustment from hedge accounting                       | 146,269            | 145,555            |\n| Exposure at Default 1                                                                       | 163,737            | 163,756            |\n| RWA 1                                                                                       | 24,099             | 16,459             |\n| RWA/Exposure at Default                                                                     | 14.7%              | 10.1%              |\n| Forbearance ratio                                                                           | 2.1%               | 2.3%               |\n| Past due ratio                                                                              | 0.6%               | 0.6%               |\n| Stage 3 ratio                                                                               | 0.9%               | 0.8%               |\n| Stage 3 coverage ratio                                                                      | 4.1%               | 5.2%               |\n| Cost of risk (in bps) 2                                                                     | -3                 | -1                 |\n| Average LtMV (indexed) 3                                                                    | 56%                | 61%                |\n| Average LtMV - excluding NHG loans (indexed) 3                                              | 56%                | 59%                |\n| Total risk mitigation                                                                       | 265,768            | 232,415            |\n| Total risk mitigation/carrying amount excluding fair value adjustment from hedge accounting | 181.7%             | 159.7%             |\n\n- 1 The RWA and Exposure at Default amounts are based on the exposure class Secured by immovable property. This scope is slightly broader than the residential mortgage portfolio.\n- 2 Annualised impairment charges on loans and advances customers for the period divided by the average loans and advances customers on the basis of gross carrying amount and excluding fair/uni00A0value adjustment from hedge accounting.\n- 3 As of Q4 2021, the indexation of collateral values is based on Calcasa information instead of the CBS index. This is applied prospectively in our mortgage portfolio indicators, previously published data are not updated.\n\nThe residential mortgage portfolio increased by 0.5% to/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0146.4/uni00A0billion in 2021 (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A0145.7/uni00A0billion). ABN/uni00A0AMRO's market share in new/uni00A0mortgage production in 2021 came out at 16% (2020:/uni00A014%), reflecting strong operational capabilities and/uni00A0well-balanced pricing strategy in a competitive market.\n\n/uni00A0\n\nThe proportion of amortising mortgages continued to increase, totalling 41% at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 37%). Total redemptions were 7% higher than in 2020. Contractual redemptions gradually increased in line with changes in the portfolio composition. Extra repayments in 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A02.4/uni00A0billion, an increase of 9% compared to 2020. The share of mortgages covered by the National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG) scheme decreased slightly compared to 31 December 2020, from 23% to 22%.\n\n## Credit quality indicators\n\nIn general, the credit quality indicators for residential mortgages improved in line with the performance of the/uni00A0Dutch housing market. The implementation of the new/uni00A0definition of default (DoD) and associated credit risk models follows from EBA guidelines aimed at improving consistency in the measurement of credit risk across institutions and jurisdictions in the EU.\n\nThe past due ratio remained stable. Affordability of mortgages remained good this year, due to the government's prolonged Covid-19 support measures, combined with lower consumer spending. Stage 3 exposure increased as a result of the implementation of the new DoD. The coverage ratio for stage 3 decreased as a result of improved credit quality and higher collateral values.\n\n1",

The increase in the\n\nRWA was mainly caused by the impact of the DNB mortgage floor.

This is reflected in the mortgage portfolio indicators. The long-term loan-to-market value (LtMV) of the bank's portfolio is expected to decrease further as a combined result of rising housing prices, contractual and extra redemptions, and the gradual reduction in mortgage interest tax relief.\n\nThe gross carrying amount of mortgages with an LtMV in excess of 100% increased due to the changed indexation method in Q4 2021 and totalled EUR/uni00A02.0/uni00A0billion at year-end 2021 (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion). It should be noted that LtMVs in excess of 100% do not necessarily indicate clients in financial difficulties. ABN/uni00A0AMRO actively approaches clients with an interest-only mortgage in combination with a high LtMV level to discuss changing their mortgage product. Mortgages with an LtMV >100% account for 1.3% of total mortgages, while approximately 2% of the extra repayments relate to this category.\n\n## Breakdown of residential mortgage portfolio by loan type\n\n|                                      | 31 December 2021       | 31 December 2021      | 31 December 2020       | 31 December 2020      |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                 | Gross carrying  amount | Percentage   of total | Gross carrying  amount | Percentage   of total |\n| Interest only (partially)            | 41,953                 | 29%                   | 43,174                 | 30%                   |\n| Interest only (100%)                 | 21,995                 | 15%                   | 22,847                 | 16%                   |\n| Redeeming mortgages (annuity/linear) | 60,183                 | 41%                   | 54,084                 | 37%                   |\n| Savings                              | 10,788                 | 7%                    | 12,240                 | 8%                    |\n| Life (investment)                    | 7,223                  | 5%                    | 8,571                  | 6%                    |\n| Other 1                              | 4,208                  | 3%                    | 4,756                  | 3%                    |\n| Total                                | 146,351                | 100%                  | 145,672                | 100%                  |\n\nFully interest-only mortgages decreased from 16% to 15% of the total mortgage portfolio in 2021, while approximately 20% of the extra repayments related to this type of loan.\n\nWe have almost no fully interest-only mortgages with an LtMV >100%.

This new category derives from a new nationwide energy label methodology introduced at the start of 2021. This new methodology includes energy labels A+ to A++++. The increase in A and higher-than-A labels was mainly due to a relatively higher inflow and relatively lower outflow in these categories, with opposite movements in the inflows and outflows of lower energy labels (i.e. labels B to G ). These movements are consistent with ABN/uni00A0AMRO's ambition to expand the proportion of A and higher-than-A labels in the portfolio.\n\n## Commercial Real Estate (CRE)\n\nThe size of the Dutch commercial real estate investment market decreased in 2021 as a result of the economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19 and newly introduced policies limiting investors' options for investing in residential real estate. A total of EUR/uni00A017.1/uni00A0billion was invested in 2021, a decrease of 9.4 per cent compared to 2020, marking a decline for the second year in a row. Although rents\n\ndecreased in 2021, the value of offices increased as a result of economic growth, the low unemployment rate and low interest rates. Owing to Covid-19, the work-from-home trend continued; the market expectation is that this will result in office space being used differently in future, with more space for collaborations and fewer work spaces. However, this will not necessarily reduce demand for office space in the long run.\n\nThe residential market saw a small decline in value in the first quarter of 2021, but increased again in the following quarters. The highest growth is currently outside the major cities. The residential market will benefit from the low unemployment rate. Demand for private rental properties remains high due to rising housing prices, stricter mortgage rules, lack of new-builds and the more limited access to social housing rentals.\n\nThe industrial market benefited in 2021 from the continued strong rise in e-commerce. This trend had already been visible in the past few years, especially in 2020, but gained\n\n1",

At the same time, the continuing rise of e-commerce is putting pressure on the retail market, which is struggling. Both rents and values of retail real estate have fallen and will continue to do so.\n\n## CRE portfolio\n\nExposure in the CRE portfolio is reported in line with the EBA guidelines on loan origination and monitoring and includes all loans aimed at acquiring CRE property or secured by CRE property, whereby CRE means any incomeproducing real estate, either existing or under development or renovation. It excludes social housing, property owned by end-users, buy-to-let housing below a market value of/uni00A0EUR/uni00A02/uni00A0million and unsecured general purpose lending. The/uni00A0credit exposure relating to the above definition is monitored on a quarterly basis and subject to an EAD limit.\n\nCompared to 2020, the gross carrying amount in/uni00A02021 increased markedly by 9% to EUR/uni00A013.6/uni00A0billion\n\n## Breakdown of CRE portfolio by asset type\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Other asset types include mixed real estate and properties in the hospitality and parking industries.\n- 2 Excluding Private Banking International.\n- 3 Excluding collateral not defined as commercial real estate collateral, such as currency and deposits, financial guarantees and life insurance policies pledged.\n\n## CRE energy labels\n\nWith more focus on ESG and sustainability, ABN AMRO's mission is to have an average A label in the CRE portfolio (Mission 2030). In the coming years, ABN AMRO will be working towards this goal by seeking to increase the A and/uni00A0higher than A labels in the CRE portfolio and lowering the exposure to E-G energy labels.\n\nIn line with this mission, the distribution of energy labels has/uni00A0slightly/uni00A0improved,/uni00A0compared to 2020, with an increase in higher than A labels, and 64% of the CRE portfolio now having an energy label of D or higher (31 December 2020: 61%). Moreover, more than 90% of assets in/uni00A0the CRE\n\n(31/uni00A0December 2020: EUR 12.4/uni00A0billion) as a result of new client lending in the context of TLTRO. This also had a positive effect on the credit quality indicators. The stage 3 impaired ratio decreased marginally to 2.6% (31 December 2020: 3.5%). The impairment rate was mainly seen in clients with retail properties. This was expected, given the impact of Covid-19.\n\nThe CRE loan portfolio is largely collateralised by Dutch properties and consists primarily of investment loans that are well diversified across different asset types. To maintain a well-balanced portfolio and manage the total exposure to CRE within our risk appetite, we have limits and sub-limits in place in terms of EAD. The overview below per asset type is therefore expressed in EAD. Compared to 2020, and in line with the gross carrying amount, the EAD increased markedly by 12% in 2021 to EUR/uni00A014.4/uni00A0billion (31 December 2020: EAD 12.9/uni00A0billion). During 2021, the asset type 'other' was refined (it previously included mixed asset types), resulting in a redistribution between existing asset types, and mostly to residential and retail properties.\n\nportfolio have an energy label (31 December 2020: 87%). Assets that are out of scope (e.g. land and parking spaces) are assigned to 'No label'. Most labels reported are based on energy labels from EP-Online and are the officially registered labels of the properties. A small portion of the labels are calculated labels, and approximately 10% is unknown owing to the property being under development or not yet registered.",

This risk management framework is in line with the three LoD model and provides assurance that the bank's trading activities are consistent with its clientfocused business strategy and moderate risk profile. In accordance with the strategy, the Business Risk Committee Trading annually approves trading mandates and limits, which define the nature and amount of the permitted transactions and risks, as well as the associated constraints. The limit utilisation is monitored and discussed by first and second LoD on a daily basis. The Business Risk Committee Trading is a subsidiary committee of the Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Market risk measurement for the trading book b\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO measures and manages market risk in the trading book on a daily basis. The key metrics used are economic capital, regulatory capital, Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR) and Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), together with a wide array of stress and scenario tests, sensitivity measures, concentration limits and notional limits. These metrics are measured and monitored on a daily basis. Appropriate limits are set at bank level in the Risk Appetite Statement and at bank and business-line levels in the limit framework, in line with the general risk principles in the Central Trading Risk policy.\n\nMetrics and models are managed, reviewed, assessed and, if required, adjusted in a similar way as in the banking book. Other important tools to ensure the adequacy of the models, alongside the formal validation and review of models, are the daily explanation of risk reporting figures, periodic portfolio reviews and regular back-testing.\n\n## Review of 2021 results\n\n## Internal aggregated diversified and undiversified VaR for all trading positions\n\nb\n\n## Validation procedure\n\nFor all models, including market risk models, we have a model risk policy in place. This policy requires that model assumptions and limitations are documented and independently validated by Model Validation. For material changes, the regulator performs an onsite investigation before such a model change is applied in production.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nThe calculation of economic capital for market risk in the trading book is based on a daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) market risk measure and historical scenarios simulating stress events such as 'Black Monday' and the financial markets crisis.\n\n## Stress testing and scenario/uni00A0analysis\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are designed to focus specifically on the impact of tail events that are outside the VaR confidence interval. We perform daily stress tests for large movements in risk factors. Scenario analyses are also conducted frequently to evaluate the impacts of extreme market events that cover multiple risk factors, and the results of these tests are monitored. These scenarios can be based on historical or hypothetical events, or on a combination of the two.\n\nFor each risk type, sensitivities are monitored against limits. This includes all risk types mentioned above and the base risks in the trading portfolio. In addition, the holding period is monitored as a measure of the liquidity of the positions.\n\n## Valuation adjustments\n\nFor the trading book, we take into account adjustments for counterparty risk on our clients (Credit Valuation Adjustment), ABN/uni00A0AMRO funding costs (Funding Valuation Adjustment) and ABN/uni00A0AMRO credit risk (Debt Valuation Adjustment).\n\nTrading book positions are subject to prudent valuation standards in accordance with regulatory requirements. The prudent value is derived from IFRS fair value accounting and includes additional value adjustments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                       | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021         | 31 December 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                  | Commodities        | Equity             | Foreign   exchange | Interest   rate    | Total undiversified  VaR | Diversified   VaR  |\n| VaR at last trading day of the period |                    |                    | 0.1                | 1.0                | 1.1                      | 0.9                |\n| Highest VaR                           | 0.3                | 0.4                | 0.8                | 4.9                | 5.3                      | 4.3                |\n| Lowest VaR                            |                    |                    | 0.1                | 0.7                | 0.9                      | 0.7                |\n| Average VaR                           | 0.1                |                    | 0.1                | 2.0                | 2.3                      | 1.8                |\n|                                       |                    |                    |                    |                    |                          | 31 December 2020   |\n| VaR at last trading day of the period | 0.1                | 0.1                | 0.2                | 1.4                | 1.8                      | 1.2                |\n| Highest VaR                           | 0.5                | 0.3                | 0.8                | 5.7                | 6.1                      | 3.9                |\n| Lowest VaR                            | 0.1                |                    | 0.1                | 0.6                | 0.9                      | 0.7                |\n| Average VaR                           | 0.2                | 0.1                | 0.2                | 2.4                | 2.8                      | 2.2                |\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

        "page_content": "ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies a diversified portfolio VaR approach that takes into account the fact that returns across risk factors may offset one another to a certain extent and consequently reduce risk. As long as these returns are not perfectly correlated to one another, VaR figures based on a diversified portfolio approach will be lower than if the figures are calculated using undiversified VaR. Undiversified VaR means that the VaR figures computed for the different risk factors are summed up without taking into account any offset across risk factors, and therefore negates the potential for risk reduction. The following graph shows the total one-day VaR at a 99% confidence level ('VaR diversified') and aggregation of the stand-alone risk factors ('VaR undiversified').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe average 1-day VaR at a 99% confidence level moved from EUR 2.2 million to EUR 1.8 million, comparing 2020 to 2021. The decrease was mainly due to the volatile scenarios in the first six months of 2020 falling out of the 250-day VaR/uni00A0window. The volatility in the first half of 2020 was related to the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nThe average 1-day undiversified VaR at a 99% confidence level moved from EUR 2.8 million to EUR 2.3 million, comparing 2020 to 2021. The cause was the same as the one explaining the move in diversified VaR. In 2021 and 2020, interest rates were the largest VaR component. The/uni00A0interest rate component includes both specific risk (i.e./uni00A0credit spread risk) and generic risk.\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nMarket risk regulatory capital increased to EUR/uni00A0133/uni00A0million (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A0106/uni00A0million) as risk-weighted assets increased to EUR/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A01.7/uni00A0billion). The increase was due to increases in the SVaR and IRC, partly offset by a decrease in the VaR. The/uni00A0strongest effect was for the SVaR, due to position changes. The 1-day SVaR increased from EUR/uni00A04/uni00A0million to/uni00A0EUR/uni00A06/uni00A0million, which resulted in an increase in the SVaR RWA from EUR/uni00A00.5/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A00.8/uni00A0billion.\n\n## IBOR reform\n\nIn 2014, at the request of the G20, the Financial Stability Board issued a report on 'Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks'. This report set out several recommendations for strengthening existing benchmarks for key interbank offered rates (IBOR) in unsecured lending markets, and for promoting the development and adoption of alternative nearly risk-free reference rates, where appropriate. These recommendations led to a fundamental review of the key interest rate benchmarks used in global financial markets. In/uni00A02021, public authorities in various jurisdictions continued to make progress on reforming or replacing the existing benchmarks in order to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO introduced a bank-wide project, under the responsibility of the CFO and led by ALM and Treasury, to prepare the bank for the forthcoming changes in IBOR. Whereas the switch in the discounting regime for centrally cleared swaps was completed in 2020, work on the change in the discounting regime for bilateral counterparties continued throughout 2021. The changes required to move away from benchmark rates that will cease to exist were executed successfully during the year. Centrally cleared swaps denominated in CHF, JPY and GBP were migrated in/uni00A0December 2021. Financial instruments referencing benchmark interest rates that have been reformed, such as EURIBOR, will not need to transition.",

Market risk in the banking book consists predominantly of interest rate risk and credit spread risk in the liquidity portfolio. Funding spread risk and foreign exchange risk are also recognised as market risks in the banking book. However, these are relatively immaterial.\n\n## Market risk management for the banking book\n\nb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has a detailed risk management framework in place to identify, measure and control market risk in the banking book. This framework provides assurance that the banking book activities remain consistent with the bank's strategy to pursue a moderate risk profile. The day-to-day management is delegated from the Asset & Liability Committee to Asset and Liability Management, while Treasury is responsible for the execution of hedge transactions. These departments form the first line of defence. Market & ALM/T Risk Management acts as the second line of defence.\n\nThe risk appetite is articulated in terms of net interest income, the economic value of equity and the economic capital for market risk in the banking book, and expresses the maximum loss the bank is willing to accept. The risk appetite is cascaded into a limit framework.\n\n## Interest rate risk in the banking book\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of losses in the economic value of equity or the bank's net interest income (NII) due to yield curve developments. In order to measure interest rate risk, models are used and assumptions on client behaviour are made, most importantly with respect to the maturity of savings and the prepayment of mortgages. These assumptions influence the anticipated interest cash flow pattern. Interest rate risk is continuously managed in line with the risk appetite as the profile of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet can change if client behaviour changes.\n\nThe main sources of interest rate risk are:\n\n- H The maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. ABN/uni00A0AMRO provides mortgages and commercial loans with fixed interest terms. These assets are funded by non-maturing deposits and wholesale funding with a shorter average interest maturity than the assets;\n- H Client behaviour, which determines the maturity profile of some of our products. As we use models to predict this behaviour, we are exposed to model risk.\n\nTo manage the interest rate sensitivity in the banking book and keep in line with the bank's strategy and risk appetite, ABN AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro) hedges and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges. Micro hedges are used to swap fixed funding transactions and fixed investments in the liquidity buffer for floating interest rate positions. In addition, macro hedging is applied in order to align with the bank's strategy to contribute to a stable NII while protecting the economic value of equity.\n\n## Key assumptions for modelling/uni00A0client behaviour\n\nFrom an interest rate risk perspective, the following aspects of client behaviour are the most important:\n\n- H Client behaviour with respect to early redemption of residential mortgages. This has a significant impact on the average interest maturity of the mortgage portfolio. Clients have the option to fully or partially prepay mortgages before maturity. Prepayments may be triggered by, for example, relocation, redemption or curtailment. An important driver of prepayments is the interest rate incentive, i.e. the difference between a client's current mortgage rate and prevailing mortgage rates. Future mortgage rates are simulated using a Monte Carlo approach. In addition to the interest rate incentive, other drivers such as loan age, seasonality and house price developments are also taken into account;\n- H Client acceptance of the volume offered and the deviation between the offered rate and the actual coupon on an offered residential mortgage;\n- H Client behaviour with respect to non-maturing deposits that are callable on demand. Future client rates for savings and current accounts are modelled using a replicating portfolio model. Modelled client rates depend on current or lagged yield curves and funding costs. A maximum maturity of 10 years is assumed. The resulting duration depends on product type and client behaviour.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "The metrics used for market risk in the banking book are dependent upon the assumptions made in the behavioural models. Models must therefore be based on extensive research, including historical data regarding observed client behaviour. Models must be independently validated and approved by the mandated risk committees. Models are periodically assessed to determine whether they behave appropriately and are statistically sound; if required, they are adjusted.\n\n## Risk measurement for interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is measured by NII at risk, the present value of one basis point (PV01), and the economic value of equity (EVE) at risk. To ensure a comprehensive approach to risk management and identify potential weaknesses, the metrics are complemented by stress testing and scenario analysis. Stress testing and scenario analyses go beyond determining the impact of alternative developments of interest rates. Assumptions with respect to modelling and client behaviour are also tested. A combination of market and product floors is applied. These floors are reviewed periodically.\n\nFor management purposes, the interest rate risk position is monitored by the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) on a monthly basis. The above metrics are also regularly reported to the Executive Board.\n\n## Credit spread risk in the banking book\n\nCredit spread risk is the risk of losses due to adverse movements in the credit spread of assets. The main source is from bonds held for liquidity purposes. It is measured as the impact on economic value of a 1bp change in spreads to a swap rate. The sensitivity is measured for individual term points, as well as for a parallel shift of the curve.\n\n## Market risk in the banking book metrics\n\nInterest rate risk\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                  |   31 December 2021 |   31 December 2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| NII impact from an instantaneous increase in interest rates of 100bps |               98   |               61   |\n| NII impact from an instantaneous decrease in interest rates of 100bps |             -218   |              -39   |\n| NII impact from a gradual increase in interest rates of 200bps        |              268   |              234   |\n| NII impact from a gradual decrease in interest rates of 200bps        |             -251   |              -81   |\n| PV01                                                                  |               -5.9 |               -3.9 |\n\nNII-at-Risk is the difference in NII between a base scenario and an alternative scenario observed over a 1-year horizon. In addition to the regulatory prescribed scenarios, the internal metric is defined as the worst outcome of the following scenarios: a gradual increase or decrease in interest rates by 200bps, measured over a one-year period, and an instantaneous increase or decrease of 100bps.\n\nNII-at-Risk includes all expected cash flows, including commercial margins and other spread components, from all interest rate-sensitive assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the banking book. The NII-at-Risk calculation contains assumptions about the future balance sheet, including the reinvestment of maturing positions.\n\n## Funding spread risk\n\nFunding spread risk is the risk of losses due to adverse movements in the term structure of rates at which ABN/uni00A0AMRO can fund itself - expressed as a spread to a benchmark such as EURIBOR. Funding spread movements can arise due to changes in, for example, the perceived credit quality of ABN/uni00A0AMRO, changes in the competitive environment or changes in liquidity premiums. They may be entity-specific or systemic by nature. If funding spreads widen, it costs more to fund assets on the balance sheet. Unless this increased spread is passed on to clients by increasing client rates, the projected net interest income will decrease. The funding spread risk is measured using an NII-at-risk approach whereby the funding spread increases.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk b\n\nForeign exchange (FX) risk is the risk arising from adverse movements in FX spot and forward rates and/or FX volatility. It is managed within the bank by ALM and Treasury. As a general rule, foreign exchange risk is hedged by using cross-currency swaps to swap the exposure in foreign currency to EUR. If, for operational reasons, it is inefficient to hedge exposures in foreign currencies, an open currency position (OCP) remains. This is measured by the aggregated net position per currency, except for EUR.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nEconomic capital for market risk in the banking book is calculated using a parametric Monte Carlo simulation model that determines the economic capital needed to absorb losses resulting from adverse movements in interest rates, client behaviour for mortgages and non-maturing deposits, volatility, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates.",

This definition is in line with the definition applied by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Operational risk covers multiple non-financial risks, such as HR risk, information risk, compliance risk, legal risk and model risk.\n\n## Operational risk management\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has a holistic approach to operational risk\n\nmanagement, providing the business with a clear and fair view on the operational risks that the bank faces and the way these should be managed. For this purpose, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has in place a framework that enables operational risks to be managed within its moderate risk profile. The Information and Operational Risk Management (I&ORM) department sets this framework for the bank in line with the requirements of the BCBS and the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA). This framework evolves and is kept current as experience gained is incorporated. The main components of the framework are shown in the following diagram.\n\n## Framework for operational risk\n\n## Management Control Statement\n\n## Strategic risk assessment\n\n## Operational risk management overview\n\n- Non-financial (operational) risk\n- Risk appetite reporting\n- Operational risk capital\n\n## Operational risk assessments\n\n- Business-as-usual (including scenarios)\n- Changes\n\n## Monitoring\n\n- Operational risk events\n- Effectiveness of controls\n- Key Risk Indicators\n\n## Operational risk responses\n\n- Mitigation\n- Avoidance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransfer\n\n- Risk acceptance\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's operational risk management framework is\n\nsupported by the three lines of defence (3LoD) model./uni00A0The division and clarity in roles and responsibilities across the three lines of defence reflect the bank's view that managing operational risk requires a concerted effort from all. Operational risk views are provided in risk reports at various levels within the bank, up to the Executive Board and\n\nSupervisory Board.\n\n## Framework for operational risk management\n\nRisk identification, assessments, response and monitoring activities are at the heart of our operational risk management framework. Despite preventive measures being in place, incidents and operational losses are inherent to our business. ABN/uni00A0AMRO systematically tracks and analyses such events in order to learn from them and use them as early warnings. We scan external developments and identify emerging risks for further assessment. Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are monitored to signal adverse risk developments.\n\nManagers in the first line perform assessments to identify and assess risks, including scenarios for rare events. Assessments are executed for business-as-usual activities and for new initiatives. Assessments also enhance risk awareness throughout the organisation. If a risk exceeds or is predicted to be outside the risk appetite, the manager in the first line takes appropriate actions.\n\nAt least once a year, managers in the first line monitor the effectiveness of the controls in their areas of responsibility and update them as necessary. Management may also decide to avoid risks by terminating certain operations, consciously tolerate a certain risk or transfer a risk to insurance companies or within the group. With respect to the latter option, the bank has in place a global insurance programme which is reviewed annually by the Group Risk Committee.\n\nOnce a year, senior management also reviews the strategic business objectives and the measures taken from a risk perspective. At the end of each year, based on the effectiveness of the control environment and the strategic risk outlook, senior management signs a Management Control Statement (MCS), which is published in this Report directly after the Sustainability risk section.\n\n## Specific operational risk areas\n\nThe bank has in place a dedicated organisation for operational risk areas that require specific knowledge, such as compliance risk, information security, business continuity management and model risk management.",

It can result in security risks and incidents and in financial and reputational damage arising from financial or other types of crime and misconduct or illegal conduct on the part of clients, the bank or its employees.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO must continuously live up to regulatory expectations. It is expected to act as a gatekeeper in detecting financial and economic crime, and to fulfil obligations arising under its duty of care to clients and society./uni00A0An effective compliance culture, programme and function are essential for ABN/uni00A0AMRO's licence to operate and for protecting our integrity and reputation.\n\nIn 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO focused on further enhancing the maturity of the Compliance function and its operating practices, as part of the priorities of Risk Management. The objectives of the Compliance function, which acts as a servant leader with countervailing power, are synchronised with the strategic objectives of ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\n## Information security/uni00A0\n\nInformation is one of the bank's most valuable assets. Our clients rely increasingly on digitalisation and online banking, even more so since the Covid-19 outbreak. This means proper functioning of the bank's IT systems is crucial. These systems run in complex information infrastructures, connecting the bank's networks to public networks. Banking processes and their supporting information systems are therefore inherently vulnerable to threats to the security of client data and services. Examples of such threats include social engineering and phishing, computerassisted fraud, unauthorised disclosure of confidential information, virus infections and ransomware, and distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS).\n\nIn recognition of the vital importance of protecting its information, systems and infrastructure at all times, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has established a structured IT risk management approach to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. This approach defines the organisational framework, management and staff responsibilities, and the information security directives that apply to ABN/uni00A0AMRO, its vendors and third parties with whom the bank exchanges information.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic/uni00A0meant that/uni00A0remote working remained the norm in 2021. We consequently continued to secure and expand remote capabilities for clients, vendors and employees, including digital signing and execution of our digital workplace strategy. As part of being a personal\n\nbank in a digital age, we increasingly embedded video conferencing into our daily business to enable ABN/uni00A0AMRO to continue offering a seamless service to clients.\n\nIn line with the bank's strategy, the IT transformation continued through the adoption of Cloud services and DevOps ways of working. These were accompanied by improvements to safeguard ABN/uni00A0AMRO's overall security position and to foster security by design. We also increased our efforts to keep pace with evolving cyber threats such as phishing and ransomware, while ensuring regulatory compliance. Our improved defences against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) proved to be effective, thus helping to mitigate attacks and limit disruption for our customers. We are continuing to invest in the overall stability of our digital payment services and maintain the operating effectiveness of our risk and control framework.\n\nThe availability of the bank's internet banking services during prime time was an average of 99.90% in 2021. Availability was impacted by a few operational incidents during the year, but these incidents were fully resolved and the results of the root-cause analyses served as input for continuous improvement. Overall, information risk management remains a prominent area of attention for senior management and our supervisor. The robustness of the control environment, the stability and availability of systems, and the underlying infrastructure and architecture are focus points for strengthening our cyber posture and for future-proofing our organisation.\n\n## Fraud risk\n\nFraud risk is the risk of financial loss or reputational damage resulting from internal or external fraud incidents committed by - or with the involvement of - an employee, agent, broker, intermediary, external party or the bank's clients.\n\nIn 2021, our clients and the bank faced a rise in payment frauds and losses, in particular related to impersonation scams. In these types of scams, fraudsters impersonate someone the client trusts. Social media scams, where a fraudster poses as a family member, were another frequently seen type of fraud. Multiple explanations for this rise/uni00A0have been identified:/uni00A0accelerated digitisation due to the pandemic has created chances for fraudsters by enabling them to reach more potential victims online, while data leaks have also increased the opportunities for deception and crime tools are often easily accessible. Meanwhile, fraudsters have proved continually able to devise new scams.\n\nThe vulnerabilities of digitisation require the bank to continuously improve the efficacy of its efforts to prevent fraud and improve its detection and response. The bank is also pursuing an integrated approach with public and private partners by, for example, strengthening its cooperation with\n\n1",

Collaboration is crucial if we are to continue being able to adapt to the rapidly-changing fraud landscape, to protect our clients and the bank itself against fraud and to enhance digital resilience among our clients and, by extension, in society in general.\n\n## Business continuity management/uni00A0\n\nBusiness continuity management (BCM) ensures organisational resilience at all levels within ABN/uni00A0AMRO. It focuses on setting up and maintaining ABN/uni00A0AMRO's crisis management capability (i.e. framework, process, tooling, people) to enable the organisation to remain well-prepared and able to respond by way of a controlled and effective crisis mode in the face of severe threats and calamities such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Our key tasks include the following:\n\n- H Scanning the operating environment for threats that could trigger a calamity and/or crisis;\n- H Analysing threats and the business impact of a (potential) calamity and/or crisis;\n- H Determining the strategies and solutions to be applied in the event of a calamity and/or crisis - such as emergency management, business recovery, crisis management and IT disaster recovery planning - to ensure the safety of our employees, clients and visitors and enable continuity of business operations;\n- H Documenting, periodically assessing and testing these strategies and solutions.\n\nMitigations such as business continuity plans, crisis management, business relocation plans and IT disaster recovery plans are in place to prepare for and deal with incidents and crises threatening the continuity of critical business processes. Evaluations and root cause analyses are also performed to analyse incidents and implement lessons learned.\n\n## Physical security\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's Physical Security Policy (PSP) enables a fit-for-purpose framework that safeguards people, information, buildings and company assets against damages and disruptions. We operate a multidisciplinary approach by combining insights from key areas such as Business Continuity Management, Security & Integrity Management, HR/Workplace Management, Corporate Information Security and business lines.\n\nThe PSP includes governance procedures that distribute roles and responsibilities across various internal departments, branches, (critical) corporate buildings and foreign offices with the aim of coordinating (complex) physical security issues such as events associated with chronic or acute climate changes. Evaluations such as physical security risk assessments are regularly executed on data centers, (critical) corporate buildings and sites in the Netherlands and abroad. ABN/uni00A0AMRO did not experience any material financial loss due to extreme weather linked to climate change in 2021.\n\n## Change risk\n\nChange is fundamental to the bank's strategy. And a key factor in our desire to succeed as a personal bank in a digital age. Being agile and adaptable is crucial for our customer-centric approach. Responding to change is what makes us commercial, progressive and entrepreneurial. Implementing the bank's strategy requires multiple change initiatives. We currently have multiple programmes in operation. These are instrumental in resolving identified weaknesses within the bank. In 2021, we therefore continued our efforts to further mature our change management framework by providing ongoing second-line opinions on all strategic programmes.\n\n## Data management\n\nData is increasingly important for a 'personal bank in a digital age'. ABN/uni00A0AMRO fully recognises that inadequate data management poses significant risks to innovation, risk management and decision-making, as well as to regulatory compliance. We are continuing the various bank-wide initiatives that have been started in order to address these risks in a sustainable manner and remain within focus of senior management and stakeholders.\n\n## Model risk management\n\nModels are developed and applied to quantify the risk for most of the risk types listed in the risk taxonomy. We define model risk as the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based substantially or partly on incorrect output of models, due to errors in the development, implementation or use of such models. This definition is in line with the definition in the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). To monitor and mitigate risks arising from the use of these models, the model risk management department acts as the second line of defence. As an independent department, it sets the framework for the bank in line with regulatory requirements for model risk and independently validates models before they can be used. For this purpose,/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO has in place independent model validation standards and procedures as part of its model risk management framework.",

The AMA model estimates potential operational risk losses (annually aggregated) by combining forward-looking and backward-looking views on operational risk events.\n\nRisk self-assessments and scenario analyses provide a forward-looking view. Experts use these tools to build scenarios to evaluate future risks and estimate the severity of potential losses that could occur. The resulting estimates are used as data input for the model. In these scenarios, experts take into consideration the quality of the bank's control environment, its processes, systems and people, as well as external circumstances and changes that may have an influence. The ongoing relevance of the estimations (and hence of the capital) is safeguarded by reviewing the scenarios at regular intervals as well as when major changes occur in the risk profile.\n\nAlongside these expert-based estimations, the model also uses historical loss data from ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the banking industry. Historical loss data are included as these are assumed to provide some level of predictive information about future losses.\n\n## Capital for operational risk\n\nThe level of AMA capital is derived from the results of the model calculations. The bank applies a 99.95% confidence level to the annually aggregated losses when calculating the operational risk economic capital, whereas a 99.9% confidence level is applied to calculate regulatory operational risk capital. The adequacy of the capital levels is monitored on a quarterly basis; if issues occur - for example, regarding the reliability of data - add-ons can be applied.\n\nOperational risk Risk Weighted Assets (RWA), calculated\n\nusing the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), slightly decreased in 2021 to EUR/uni00A016.0/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A016.7/uni00A0billion). The decrease was mainly attributable to the removal of a regulatory capital add-on. As the ECB's finding on the model validation process was resolved by\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO, the associated capital add-on could be\n\nremoved. During 2021, some drivers of capital decrease (e.g. exclusion from capital of the estimated AML fine) were also offset by drivers of capital increase (legacy cases, claim risk).\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's current operational risk capital level (measured against the bank's gross income) is in line with that of peer banks with a moderate risk profile (based on updated ORX benchmark data).\n\n## Operational risk by event category\n\nOperational losses include direct losses, as well as provisions for legal claims. The net operational loss may be negative, meaning provisions formed in the past have been released because no payments to claimants were ultimately made. Losses are reported according to event categories such as External Fraud; Internal Fraud; Clients, Products & Business Practices; Execution, Delivery & Process Management; Employee Practices & Workplace Safety; Disaster & Public Safety, and Technology & Infrastructure Failures.\n\nA high total net operational loss was recorded in 2021. This was mainly attributable to the event category of Clients, Products & Business Practices, and predominantly caused by two large operational losses, accounting for approximately 92% of the total net operational loss:\n\n- H The settlement of EUR/uni00A0480/uni00A0million agreed with the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service in connection with the AML investigation;\n- H The provision that was formed for a compensation scheme for clients who in the past paid too much interest on their revolving consumer credits.\n\nThe second largest event category, which accounts for nearly 3% of the total net operational loss, was Execution, Delivery & Process Management. Risk awareness, continued strengthening of controls and attention to learning from events are helping to limit these losses.\n\nExternal Fraud caused nearly 2% of the total net operational/uni00A0loss. More than 50% of this loss was caused by/uni00A0compensation that was paid, following an agreement with the Dutch Ministry of Finance,/uni00A0to victims of spoofing.\n\n1",

There are two types of liquidity risk:\n\n- H Funding liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to accommodate both expected and unexpected current and future cash outflows and collateral needs because insufficient cash is available. Eventually, this can affect the bank's daily operations or its financial condition;\n- H Market liquidity risk is the risk that the bank cannot sell an asset in a timely manner at a reasonable market price due to insufficient market depth (insufficient supply and demand) or market disruption. Market liquidity risk includes the sensitivity in liquidity value of a portfolio due to changes in the applicable haircuts and market value. It also concerns uncertainty about the time required to liquidate assets in periods of stress./uni00A0\n\n## Framework\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nWe have a liquidity risk management framework in place that helps us maintain a moderate risk profile and safeguards the bank's reputation from a liquidity perspective. This framework enables us to meet regulatory requirements and payment obligations at a reasonable cost, even under severely adverse conditions. A set of liquidity risk metrics and limits help manage the liquidity position. By maintaining a smooth long-term maturity profile, managing dependence on wholesale funding and holding a solid liquidity buffer in our main currencies, we maintain a prudent liquidity profile. The liquidity position is monitored on a daily basis.\n\n## Funding strategy\n\nOur main source of funding is our strong client deposit base. The remainder of our funding is raised largely through various types of long-term and short-term wholesale funding instruments. Our wholesale funding strategy targets a moderate risk profile with a stable and diversified funding mix that reflects the composition of our loan book. This strategy aims to optimise the bank's funding sources in order to maintain market access and the targeted funding position with a diverse, stable and cost-efficient funding base. The maturity profile of wholesale funding is optimised to avoid a concentration of outflows and to control repricing risks. The funding strategy takes the following guidelines into account:\n\n- H Maintain market access by diversifying funding sources in different funding markets (Europe, the US and the Asia-Pacific region);\n- H Continually monitor attractive funding opportunities and maintain strong relationships with the investor base through active marketing;\n- H Optimise the balance between/uni00A0public benchmark deals/uni00A0and private placements;\n- H Optimise funding costs within the targets set for volumes and maturities and manage credit curves in different funding programmes and currencies;\n- H Optimise the planning and execution of funding in different market windows and currencies.\n\n## Risk management approach b\n\nThe natural maturity mismatch between our loan book and funding portfolio requires liquidity risk management. We consider maturity transformation to be an integral part of the business model, which is why we closely monitor our liquidity position and the resulting risks. We hold a portfolio of highly liquid assets that can be converted into cash in the/uni00A0event of unforeseen market disruptions, thus allowing us to meet payment and collateral obligations at all times. Funding and liquidity risk are managed centrally. We incorporate liquidity costs into the pricing of our day-to-day business activities. In managing these risks, a clear distinction is made between going-concern and contingency risk management.\n\n## Going-concern management\n\nThe most important metrics for going-concern risk management and the management of the day-to-day liquidity position within specified limits are:\n\n- H Stress testing: in monthly and ad hoc stress tests we evaluate the impact of cash inflows and outflows under plausible stress scenarios. Market-wide as well as bankspecific stress scenarios are defined and analysed. The goal of stress testing is twofold. Firstly, it helps us to review our risk framework, i.e. the liquidity buffer size, risk appetite and risk limits. Secondly, it allows us to identify ways to reduce outflows in times of crisis;\n- H Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): The objective of the/uni00A0LCR is to assess the short-term resilience of the liquidity position by ensuring sufficient high-quality liquid/uni00A0assets to survive a significant stress scenario lasting 30 calendar days;\n- H Survival period: this is the period the liquidity position is expected to remain positive in an internal stress scenario in which wholesale funding markets deteriorate and clients withdraw a material proportion of their deposits;",

The NSFR requires banks to hold sufficient stable funding to cover the duration of their long-term assets on an ongoing basis;\n- H Loan-to-Deposit ratio (LtD): The LtD ratio measures the relationship between the loan book (loans and advances customers) and deposits from clients (due to customers), and includes all client-related loans and deposits. The ratio gives an indication of our dependence on wholesale funding for financing client loans. /uni00A0\n\n## Contingency  ris       k  management\n\nContingency risk management aims to ensure that, in the event of either a bank-specific or general market stress event, the bank is able to generate sufficient liquidity to withstand a short or long-term liquidity crisis. Contingency risk management entails:\n\n- H Contingency Funding Plan: this plan sets out the guidelines and responsibilities for addressing possible liquidity shortfalls in emergency situations.

Most of the securities in the liquidity buffer, with the exception of retained RMBS and retained covered bonds, qualify for the LCR. The liquidity buffer faces haircuts based on the market value. These haircuts are used to determine the liquidity value. Haircuts may vary between the liquidity buffer and the LCR eligible buffer as the internal assessment of the liquidity buffer may deviate from the LCR definition. The liquidity buffer decreased by EUR/uni00A04.8/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A0101.5/uni00A0billion at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A0106.3/uni00A0billion). Total green bonds in our liquidity buffer remained stable at\n\nEUR/uni00A01.0/uni00A0billion at 31 December 2021, which is 1% of the total liquidity buffer (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A01.0/uni00A0billion). In March 2020, a commitment was made to target investments in green bonds within the liquidity portfolio of up to EUR/uni00A02.5/uni00A0billion by the end of 2022. This commitment underpins our strategy to support the transition to sustainability. Targeted/uni00A0investments are bonds with use of proceeds aligned with the Green Bond Principles. Eligible green bonds are also in/uni00A0line with the EBA's Delegated Act HQLA criteria and so preserve the high quality and liquidity of the portfolio. The/uni00A0amounts of green bonds held in the liquidity portfolio are reported semi-annually.\n\n## Liquidity buffer currency diversification b\n\n| (in/uni00A0billions, liquidity value)   |   31 December 2021 |   31 December 2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| EUR                                     |               91   |               93.7 |\n| USD                                     |                8.5 |                8   |\n| JPY                                     |                1   |                2.5 |\n| GBP                                     |                0.3 |                0.3 |\n| Other                                   |                0.8 |                1.7 |\n| Total                                   |              101.5 |              106.3 |\n\nThe above table shows the breakdown per currency in the/uni00A0liquidity buffer.

Our Green Bonds Framework determines a set of criteria applicable to issuing green bonds, including how we allocate the issue proceeds from green bonds to eligible assets, the evaluation and selection of eligible assets, the independent assurance on the allocation of proceeds to eligible green assets, as well\n\nas the external reporting requirements, in order to keep investors updated. Green bonds have been issued since 2015, with a focus on sustainable real estate and renewable energy. These green bonds enable investors to invest in,/uni00A0for/uni00A0example, energy efficiency through residential mortgages, loans for solar panels on existing homes, sustainable commercial real estate and wind energy.

        "page_content": "## Capital\n\n## Capital management strategy\n\nThe primary objective of the capital management strategy is to ensure that capital adequacy requirements are met at all times and that sufficient capital is available to support the bank's strategy. Capital is a necessary resource for doing business and defines the bank's commercial possibilities. The balance between available and required capital is managed centrally to optimise the use of available capital. The basis of the capital management strategy is the bank's risk appetite and its business plans./uni00A0Other important factors taken into account when managing the capital position are expectations and/uni00A0requirements of external stakeholders (such as supervisors, investors, shareholders, equity analysts, rating agencies and clients), the bank's position in the market, market developments, contingent capital needs and the feasibility of capital management actions. Although ABN/uni00A0AMRO manages its capital centrally, the group companies are sufficiently capitalised to comply with all local regulatory solvency requirements and to meet any local business needs. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's banking activities are carried out/uni00A0by legal entities that are part of the bank's fiscal unity. Apart from prevailing statutory and regulatory legislation, there are no specific material impediments for/uni00A0prompt transfer of the bank's regulatory capital.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nThe dividend policy takes into account/uni00A0matters including current and pending regulatory capital/uni00A0requirements, our risk profile, growth in commercial/uni00A0activities and market factors. The dividend payout ratio is set in light of the bank's moderate risk profile and regulatory/uni00A0changes, and to ensure that dividend payments can be/uni00A0maintained in the future.\n\nFrom 2021 onwards, the dividend payout has been set at 50% of reported net profit, after deduction of AT1 coupon payments and minority interests. Interim dividends will be considered at 40% of the reported H1 net profit, provided profit is expected to be sustainable throughout the year, at/uni00A0the discretion of the Board./uni00A0\n\nOur CET1 capital target ratio is 13% under Basel IV. When our Basel IV CET1 ratio is above the/uni00A0threshold of 15%, we will consider share buybacks, subject to conditions and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nregulatory approval. Our threshold of 15% reflects current uncertainties, as well as/uni00A0a buffer for/uni00A0potential M&A. We intend to review the/uni00A0threshold when/uni00A0current uncertainties have reduced./uni00A0\n\nAny distribution of dividend remains discretionary, and ABN/uni00A0AMRO may propose deviations from the above policy./uni00A0\n\n## Capital measurement and allocation\n\nCapital adequacy is measured and monitored on an/uni00A0ongoing basis against target capital ratios, which are/uni00A0derived from the bank's overall risk appetite and strategy./uni00A0Capital projections and stress test scenarios, both market-wide/uni00A0and bank-specific, are used to ensure that actual/uni00A0and future capital levels remain above the targets./uni00A0Capital is allocated to businesses in a way that optimises/uni00A0the long-term value of/uni00A0the bank while serving the bank's/uni00A0strategic objectives. In/uni00A0the capital allocation process,/uni00A0both risk-based and nonrisk-based return parameters are/uni00A0considered, taking into account economic and regulatory/uni00A0capital requirements. This/uni00A0process ensures that the bank/uni00A0meets its return targets while maintaining a moderate risk/uni00A0profile in line with its risk/uni00A0appetite.\n\n## Contingency capital management\n\nContingency plans are in place to address any capital issues. The Contingency Capital Plan provides a framework to detect capital adequacy stress by setting out various early warning indicators. The plan also sets out a range of/uni00A0actions that can be undertaken, based on the level of/uni00A0severity and urgency of the issues.\n\n## Recovery and resolution planning\n\nThe Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive requires\n\na/uni00A0recovery plan and a resolution plan to be in place. ABN/uni00A0AMRO submitted a reviewed and/uni00A0updated version of/uni00A0its bank recovery plan to the ECB/uni00A0in December/uni00A02021. The/uni00A0Single Resolution Board (SRB)/uni00A0has prepared a resolution plan, in which it/uni00A0concluded that the preferred resolution strategy/uni00A0is a Single-Point-of-Entry strategy, with/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank N.V. as the resolution entity, and/uni00A0bail-in is the preferred resolution tool.\n\n1",

The CET1 capital ratio decreased compared to 31 December 2020, due to an increase in RWA and a decrease in CET1 capital. The RWA increase was mainly driven by model updates, regulatory add-ons and the impact of the DNB mortgage floor, which were only partly offset by the CIB non-core wind-down. The CET1\n\n## Developments impacting capital ratios in 2021\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe maximum distributable amount (MDA) trigger level remained at 9.6% (excluding the AT1 shortfall), including the reconfirmed Pillar 2 requirement as part of the SREP requirements for 2022. The AT1 shortfall was 0.2% on 31 December 2021. As the economy improves, the Dutch central bank is expected to gradually raise the countercyclical capital buffer requirement from 0% to 2% of risk-weighted exposures in the Netherlands. The MDA trigger level will then increase. The reported CET1 ratio of 16.3% under Basel III is well above the MDA trigger level. The bank remains committed to maintaining a significant buffer in excess of the regulatory requirements at all times.\n\nAlthough Basel III is the applicable regulatory framework, our primary metric for capital management purposes is a Basel IV CET1 target of 13%. This includes a management buffer on top of the capital requirements for SREP and Pillar 2 guidance. The European Commission's draft Basel IV proposal, published in October 2021, expects Basel IV implementation in the EU by January 2025, with temporary measures mainly aimed at gradually phasing in the impact of the output floor. Reflecting our latest views on this proposal, the bank's fully-loaded Basel IV CET1 ratio was estimated comfortably above target, at around 16%, on 31/uni00A0December 2021. The Basel IV CET1 ratio at implementation remains subject, however, to other\n\ncapital position decreased, mainly due to deductions for the share buyback programme and a further increase in the non-performing exposures (NPE) capital deductions. These deductions were only partly offset by the net profit for 2021 (after dividend and AT1 coupon payments). All capital ratios were in line with the bank's risk appetite and were comfortably above regulatory requirements./uni00A0\n\nThe following chart shows the primary drivers of the Basel/uni00A0III capital ratios in 2021.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "uncertainties, including data limitations, management actions and other portfolio developments.\n\nThe wind-down of the non-core portfolio in CIB is contributing to our current strong capital ratios under Basel III and Basel IV and strengthening our future outlook. The finalisation of TRIM and the settlement agreement reached with the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service have provided greater clarity on our capital and RWA outlook. However, several other capital headwinds and uncertainties remain, including ongoing model reviews and the impact of NPE capital deductions.\n\n## MREL\n\nOur intermediate MREL target is set at 27.1% of Basel III RWA, of which 26.6% must be met by own funds, subordinated instruments and senior non-preferred (SNP) notes. This includes the currently applicable combined buffer requirement (CBR) of 4% and applies with effect from 1 January 2022. ABN/uni00A0AMRO aims to continue operating with a prudent buffer above the fully-loaded MREL requirements.\n\nIf ABN/uni00A0AMRO fails to meet CBR as part of its MREL requirements, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) has the/uni00A0power to prohibit or limit distributions of more than the/uni00A0Maximum Distributable Amount related to the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (M-MDA). Based on own funds, subordinated instruments and SNP notes, MREL was 27.9% at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 27.4%). The increase in MREL compared to 31 December 2020 was mainly due to issuances of senior non-preferred instruments, partly offset by RWA increases and CET1 deductions.\n\n## Developments impacting capital ratios in 2021 Common Equity Tier 1 capital\n\nCET1 capital decreased in 2021, mainly reflecting the deductions for the EUR/uni00A00.5/uni00A0billion share buyback programme and a further increase in the non-performing exposures (NPE) capital deductions of EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion. Those deductions were only partly offset by the net profit for 2021. The reported CET1 ratio of 16.3% under Basel III is considerably above the MDA trigger level of 9.6%. The bank remains committed to maintaining a significant buffer in excess of the regulatory requirements at all times.\n\n## Additional Tier 1\n\nA total of EUR/uni00A02.0/uni00A0billion of AT1 instruments is currently outstanding. The AT1 instruments have triggers at the bank consolidated level (7.0% CET1) and solo level (5.125% CET1). If the CET1 ratio drops below the trigger level, the AT1 is temporarily written down. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is comfortably above the trigger levels,/uni00A0with a bank consolidated CET1 ratio of 16.3% and a bank solo CET1 ratio of 15.9%.\n\nAvailable distributable items at 31 December 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A018.7/uni00A0billion (December 2020: EUR/uni00A017.9/uni00A0billion).\n\n## Tier 2 capital\n\nThe fully-loaded total capital ratio (22.4%) decreased by 1.3/uni00A0percentage points compared to 31 December 2020 (23.7%). This was mainly due to the RWA increases and CET1 capital developments and, to a lesser extent, to the redemption of a Tier 2 instrument on 1 April 2021. A USD 1.0 billion T2 instrument was issued in December 2021. The/uni00A0T2 layer is rebalanced to 4.4% in favour of SNP. Going forward, the focus is on maintaining the T2 layer above 2.5%.\n\n## Senior non-preferred instruments\n\nA total of EUR 6.0 billion of senior non-preferred instruments is currently outstanding. The bank issued multiple senior non-preferred notes during the year under review: EUR 1.0 billion in February 2021, USD 0.8 billion in/uni00A0June 2021, EUR 1.0 billion in September 2021 and USD/uni00A01.0 billion in December 2021. ABN AMRO issued its/uni00A0first green SNPs this year, both in EUR and in USD.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nTotal RWA rose to EUR/uni00A0117.7/uni00A0billion (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A0110.5/uni00A0billion), predominantly driven by credit risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was mainly caused by model updates, regulatory add-ons and the impact of the DNB mortgage floor, partly offset by the acceleration of the CIB non-core wind-down in the first six months of 2021. Operational risk RWA slightly decreased, mainly owing to the removal of a regulatory capital add-on relating to an ECB finding on the model validation process. Market risk RWA increased as a result of increases in SVaR and IRC, partly offset by a/uni00A0decrease in the VaR resulting from position changes.\n\n## Further information on share capital, dividend and capital instruments\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe share capital remained unchanged in 2021. At/uni00A031/uni00A0December 2021, the authorised share capital amounted to EUR/uni00A02,400/uni00A0million, distributed as 2,200/uni00A0million class A ordinary shares and 200/uni00A0million class B ordinary shares. Class A and B ordinary shares have a nominal value of EUR/uni00A01.00 each.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, issued and paid-up capital amounted to EUR/uni00A0940/uni00A0million and consisted of 940/uni00A0million class/uni00A0A ordinary shares. Further information is provided in Note/uni00A033 Equity attributable to owners of the parent company in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.",

Under the CRD IV/CRR fully-loaded rules, the amount of CET1 capital and RWA are equivalent to those under the phase-in rules. Due to the grandfathering of some T2 capital instruments, the fully-loaded total capital ratio was slightly\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlower than the phase-in ratio, but both ended up at 22.4%. The fully-loaded total capital ratio was lower than the phasein ratio because the non-CRR-compliant Tier 2 capital ('grandfathered') instruments were excluded from the fullyloaded ratio. The grandfathering provisions were introduced in the CRR to ensure that institutions had sufficient time to meet the requirements set by the new definition of 'own funds', which relates to the total regulatory capital. Certain capital instruments that did not comply with the new definition were grandfathered for a transitional period, with the objective of phasing them out from the total regulatory capital. The transitional period expired on 1 January 2022.\n\n## Impact of CRD V/CRR2 fully-loaded rules on capital ratios\n\n|                                         | Fully-loaded   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------|\n| 31 December 2021                        |                |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 capital            | 19,206         |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 ratio              | 16.3%          |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (Basel IV) 1 | 16%            |\n| Tier 1 capital                          | 21,188         |\n| Tier 1 ratio                            | 18.0%          |\n| Total regulatory capital 2              | 26,324         |\n| Total capital ratio 2                   | 22.4%          |\n| RWA                                     | 117,693        |\n| Leverage ratio (SA-CRR)                 | 5.9%           |\n\n- 1 Basel IV results are based on fully-loaded figures, rounded to the nearest whole percent and subject to the implementation of Basel IV standards into EU legislation.\n- 2 Under the current CRD IV/CRR phased-in rules the total regulatory capital is EUR/uni00A026,386/uni00A0million and the total capital ratio is 22.4% per 31 December 2021 as reported in the prudential returns/uni00A0to/uni00A0DNB.\n\n## Leverage ratio\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                           | 31 December 2021 Fully-loaded   | 31 December 2020 Fully-loaded   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Tier 1 capital                                 | 21,188                          | 21,530                          |\n| Exposure measure (CRR2)                        |                                 |                                 |\n| On-balance sheet exposures                     | 399,113                         | 395,623                         |\n| Off-balance sheet exposures                    | 30,637                          | 32,781                          |\n| On-balance sheet netting 1                     | 8,186                           | 5,419                           |\n| Derivative exposures 1                         | 3,582                           | 2,462                           |\n| Securities financing exposures                 | 2,502                           | 3,115                           |\n| Other regulatory measures                      | -83,240                         | -65,801                         |\n| Exposure measure                               | 360,779                         | 373,599                         |\n| Central bank exposure                          | 66,922                          | 56,133                          |\n| Exposure measure (incl. central bank exposure) | 427,702                         | 429,732                         |\n| Leverage ratio                                 | 5.9%                            | 5.8%                            |\n| Leverage ratio (incl. central bank exposure)   | 5.0%                            | 5.0%                            |\n\n- 1 As from 28 June 2021, the exposure measure includes CRR2.

The leverage ratio requirements were amended by CRR2, which introduced a/uni00A0binding leverage ratio requirement of at least 3% and amended the requirements for calculating the exposure measure. The amendment includes the application of SA-CCR to clearing guarantees on derivative exposures. The/uni00A0leverage ratio remained stable at 5.0% at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 5.0%). The temporary capital relief measure that exempts central bank reserves from the exposure measure, which was originally expected to end on 27 September 2021, has been extended until 31 March 2022. This currently has a positive impact of 0.9 percentage points, resulting in a leverage ratio of 5.9%. The exposure measure is reported to the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) at the business line level and monitored closely in order to ensure the leverage ratio remains within the bank's risk appetite. The leverage ratio outlook takes account of business-specific plans, as well as macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments and capital-related uncertainties. In the event of risk appetite breaches of the leverage ratio, the bank-wide escalation paths for capital and funding are followed.",

        "page_content": "## Business risk\n\n## Volatility of earnings\n\nBusiness risk is the risk that business earnings and franchise value declines and/or deviates from expectations because of uncertainty in business income or in expenses incurred to generate business income. ABN/uni00A0AMRO strives to preserve its business earnings, independent of (external) developments. Business risk therefore needs to be managed in order to limit the actual and forecasted volatility in business earnings.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO manages business risk by seeking to minimise the effect of unexpected internal and/or external developments. The key criteria for classifying a risk as a business risk are:\n\n- \u00c5 An unexpected event that leads to uncertainty in present or future business earnings and/or franchise value;\n- H Changes in the drivers of future business earnings such as uncertainty in volumes, margins, fee and commission rates and/or business expenses.\n\n## Drivers of earnings volatility\n\nEarnings are affected by various internal and external factors, such as changes in client preferences, competition and regulation. In addition, earnings are affected by technical, societal, geopolitical and economic developments, such as the outbreak of Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Our risk assessments are based on the long-term uncertainty in expected business earnings and take into account internal and external developments, scenarios and market movements. When assessing the pressure from external factors contributing to an increase or decrease in the business risk, at least the following elements are considered:\n\n- \u00c5 The key macroeconomic variables within which the bank operates or will operate based on its main geographies. Examples of key variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates and house price indices;\n- \u00c5 The competitive landscape and how it is likely to evolve, considering the activities of the bank's peers;\n- \u00c5 Expected growth in target markets, and the activities and plans of key competitors in these target markets;\n- \u00c5 Overall trends in the market that may have an impact on performance and profitability. This should include, as a minimum, regulatory trends, technological trends and societal/demographic trends;\n- H The contamination effects that risks may have on other risk types, and risks downstream or upstream in client supply chains that may have knock-on effects (this includes the impact of Covid-19).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business risk appetite\n\nThe thresholds are set at the expected one-year profit horizon and form the basis for a quantitative Red, Amber, Green (RAG) status. The qualitative RAG status is based on expert judgements, taking into account elements such as pressure from external factors and strategic objectives.\n\n## Monitoring of earnings drivers\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO continually monitors and responds to the key external and internal factors and elements within these factors. The disclosure and monitoring of the business risk drivers is based, among other things, on the ERM report. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's business risk management framework is supported by the three lines of defence (3LoD) model. The bank mitigates sensitivity to business risk drivers through discussions at senior management and board level that address developments in these drivers in an effective and timely manner. Business risk is also included in the capital buffer that is meant to safeguard our position in the case of extreme events.\n\nThe bank's strategy and business risk are related. The strategy incorporates mitigation of unexpected events and changes in business risk drivers. Regular review of the strategy ensures alignment with developments in business risk. To ensure that the bank's strategy is pursued and the long-term strategic goals (financial and non-financial) are met, our business plans and budgets take these strategic goals into account.\n\n## Strategic equity investment risk\n\nAs part of business risk, strategic equity investment risk is the risk of deviation in the value of strategic equity investments. These investments are not fully consolidated in the bank's financial accounts, but are represented as an equity investment on the balance sheet. Investments related to clients and involving unlisted private equity or held for trading purposes are not considered to be strategic equity investments.\n\n1",

The economic capital for business risk reflects the maximum downward deviation of actual versus expected net operating profit in one year, excluding any impact already covered by other risk types (e.g. impairments for credit risk).\n\nTo determine the economic capital for business risk, a combination of historical and forward-looking scenarios is collected from experts in each business line and from Group Economics. These scenarios determine the sensitivity of the business lines' income/uni00A0to/uni00A0macroeconomic variables or industry performance indicators. This sensitivity is used to determine the volatility of income for each business line, as well as any correlation between business lines. Based on the individual volatilities, we use simulation to calculate bank-wide volatility.\n\nFurther to this, economic capital as a buffer for strategic equity investment risk is also considered.

Sustainability risk management is a fundamental part of safeguarding a moderate risk profile and supporting ABN/uni00A0AMRO's strategic objectives. ESG factors relate to/uni00A0(but are not limited to) the following:\n\n- \u00c5 Environmental: climate change, biodiversity loss, natural resources depletion and pollution. The climate-related and environmental risks (CER) can refer to so-called inside-out risks or outside-in risks:\n- H Inside-out risks refer to the financial and nonfinancial (or pre-financial) risks that may occur when clients of the bank impact people or planet.\n- H Outside-in risks refer to the financial and non-financial risks that may occur when climaterelated or environmental factors impact the bank's clients or portfolios. Outside-in risks are divided into transition and physical risks.\n- H Transition risks are the financial and non-financial risks that result, directly or indirectly, from the process of adjustment towards a lower-carbon and/uni00A0more environmentally sustainable economy (e.g. changes in regulation, consumer preferences and technology).\n- H Physical risk refers to the financial risk of a changing climate/uni00A0and environmental degradation. Physical risk can be acute, for example when it/uni00A0relates to extreme weather events, or chronic, relating to progressive shifts such as rising temperatures and biodiversity loss.\n- \u00c5 Social: substandard working conditions, forced labour and child labour, human trafficking, indigenous peoples' rights, privacy, animal welfare and public health.\n- \u00c5 Governance: corporate governance (e.g./uni00A0remuneration, diversity and balancing the interests of stakeholders), corporate behaviour (e.g. corruption and bribery) and ethical business conduct.\n\nAlthough ESG risks - predominantly inside-out - have been on the agenda of ABN/uni00A0AMRO since the 1990s, attention from regulators and society and from within the bank has increased significantly in recent years, especially in relation to outside-in environmental risks. ESG risks and our sustainable strategy are also clearly understood to go hand in hand, given that the bank is faced with developments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsuch as strengthened government commitments to phasing out fossil fuel investments, increasing societal expectations and changing investor preferences, resulting in both risks and opportunities for our clients and the bank.\n\nIn the bank's risk taxonomy, ESG risks are recognised as 'external causal factors'. Causal factors may be a driver of risk types, in particular those identified below. The expected impact of these external causal factors is continuously assessed and monitored, and mitigating actions are considered as part of the management of these risk types:\n\n- H Business risk, e.g. unexpected fluctuations in volumes/ margins due to lower market volumes in a specific business segment affected by transition risk./uni00A0The changes in government policies, societal expectations and investor preferences mentioned above are expected to present the bank with a potentially material business risk in, for example, carbon-intensive sectors in the medium and long term. We expect the transition to a/uni00A0low-carbon economy also to present opportunities that/uni00A0could potentially mitigate business risk.\n- H Reputational and legal risk, e.g. damage to the bank's reputation due to perceived 'greenwashing' or not meeting our sustainability commitments, or/uni00A0the risk that the bank may be subject to legal action or litigation because of a contribution (alleged or otherwise) to adverse sustainability impacts./uni00A0Climate-related reputational and litigation risk in the short term is therefore monitored continuously so that we can take appropriate mitigating actions (see sections on risk response and client assessment/uni00A0below).\n- H Credit risk, e.g. deterioration in a client's creditworthiness or collateral resulting from physical or transition risk. The potential impact is assessed by means of scenario analysis and analysis of transmission channels. See also the section below on scenario analysis and the Credit risk review section for more information on transmission channels relating to credit/uni00A0risk.\n\nSustainability risk can occur in all the bank's capacities, i.e./uni00A0as a lender, investor, asset manager, service provider, purchaser, operator and employer. Sustainability risk can also be amplified if the bank's performance does not match with its sustainable strategy and commitments, with regulatory requirements or with investor, rating agency or/uni00A0societal expectations.\n\n1",

It defines the conditions under which the bank does business with its clients, suppliers and investors, ensuring sustainability risk is properly identified, measured, managed, mitigated, monitored and reported in line with the bank's risk appetite.\n\nThe sustainability risk policy framework is subject to an annual review to incorporate new insights, practices, internal and external developments, and views of stakeholders, and to align with the latest regulatory guidance, including ECB and EBA requirements and definitions.\n\nTo support the general principles defined in the sustainability risk policy framework, exclusions, statements and standards underpin the way the bank executes its sustainability risk management.\n\n## Sustainability risk policy framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Exclusion List specifies the activities we exclude from our financial services because of their adverse ESG impact. The Controversial Weapons List (CWL), in turn, specifies the companies that we exclude because of their involvement in these types of activities. The CWL is in line with the ban on investments in cluster munition, as specified in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, supplemented with the exclusion of companies involved in other controversial weapons, including white phosphorus. By regularly reviewing and updating the Exclusion List and the CWL, ABN/uni00A0AMRO ensures that it operates in line with its purpose, values and risk appetite. New developments and scientific insights within and outside the bank are taken into consideration.\n\nOur statements set out ABN/uni00A0AMRO's commitment, responsibilities and expectations for ourselves and for our business associates including our clients, investee companies and suppliers on three important themes: climate, human rights and animal welfare.

It has delegated responsibility for the management of sustainability risk, including CER, to the Group Risk Committee. The Chief Risk Officer is the ExBo member responsible for the management of sustainability risk. A dedicated Sustainability Risk team has been appointed within the Central Risk Management department and is responsible for setting up and maintaining the sustainability risk management framework. In line with the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the 'three lines of defence' principle is applied to sustainability risk management.\n\nThe following committees are involved in internal control and strategic decision-making:\n\n- \u00c5 Group Risk Committee (GRC) for oversight on sustainability risk through the Enterprise Risk Management Report (containing the status of the Bank/uni00A0Risk Appetite Statement) and approval on sustainability risk issues;\n- \u00c5 Business Risk Committees (BRC) for oversight on sustainability risk within the specific business lines and approval on business line-specific sustainability risk issues (e.g. scenario analysis);\n- \u00c5 Engagement Advisory Committee (EAC) for oversight on client engagement;\n- \u00c5 Sustainability Advisory Committee (SAC) for internal advice on sustainability matters affecting the bank and the business environment;\n- H Scenario Analysis and Stress-test Committee (SSC) for oversight on climate-related and environmental risks scenario analyses and stress testing.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nIn line with the moderate risk profile of the bank, the sustainability risk appetite is set using indicators that address all ESG aspects of sustainability and both the inside-out and outside-in perspectives of sustainability risk at bank and business line levels. The risk indicators have both quantitative (e.g. sustainable and acceleration volumes and GHG emission intensity) and qualitative (e.g. whether human rights are adequately managed) elements. The latter reflects the fact that not enough data are yet available in this relatively new risk category./uni00A0Our Strategic Risk Appetite (SRA) references the alignment of our portfolio with the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Risk identification & measurement\n\nThe risk identification process for sustainability risk is done/uni00A0at different levels: through the categorisation or classification of exposures across asset classes, sectors,\n\ngeographies and counterparties, and/or on the basis of their length of maturity and/or the position in the lifecycle of the asset. The process includes climate risk heatmapping, sector risk classifications (including ecosystem dependency, climate and human rights risks), country risk classifications and transmission channels. These tools feed into the bank-wide risk identification processes. By also performing due diligence at client level and (scenario) analysis at portfolio level, and through stress testing, we measure the/uni00A0materiality of risks, and assess and develop appropriate mitigating measures, based on the outcomes.\n\nA Risk Register has been developed for human rights risks. This/uni00A0includes all kinds of human rights risks we can be connected to, in any capacity, and helps us record and aggregate our observations on these risks over time. The/uni00A0Risk Register feeds into our Enterprise Risk Management process and results in more robust governance and more involvement from senior management. Human rights risks are managed across a/uni00A0range of departments within the/uni00A0bank.\n\n## Risk response\n\nTo ensure sustainability risk is in line with the bank's risk appetite and strategy, mitigating actions are defined at both portfolio and counterparty level. This includes concentration limits at sector level on certain high-risk and/or sensitive economic sectors and subsectors, and exclusion of some specific sectors and subsectors from credit-granting in line with our Exclusion List and Controversial Weapons List. In accordance with the sustainability risk standard with sector requirements, minimum conditions are set for clients in certain sectors with a higher risk from a sustainability perspective. Those conditions include climate, biodiversity loss and human rights. More information on client assessment can be found below.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nTo ensure that identified sustainability risk remains within the approved risk appetite limits and checkpoints, we monitor sustainability risk, including environmental and climate-related risks, at bank-wide and business line level./uni00A0Sustainability risk at bank level is monitored and reported to the GRC and to the Executive Board in the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) report. At business line level, sustainability risk is monitored and reported through the business line risk reports, which are discussed regularly in the respective Business Risk Committees.\n\n## Sustainability risk/uni00A0and client assessment\n\nEach credit proposal with an OOE of more than EUR 1 million needs to be assessed by the first line of defence against the bank's Sustainability Risk Policies. This is done using the/uni00A0Global Sustainable Index (GSRI) tool, and increasingly in/uni00A0the new CASY tool. These tools consist of questionnaires that are based on the bank's ESG criteria and hence help\n\n1",

The tools also include a classification mechanism that leads to a low, medium or high sustainability risk profile of the client. The latter category is additionally assessed by the second line, being the sustainability risk experts in the Credit Risk department. Certain industries face more sustainability risks than others, while the nature of these risks also varies considerably. During 2021, the sustainability risk analysts in/uni00A0Credit Risk provided advice on clients operating in industries with a higher sustainability risk profile on 288 occasions (2020: 376).\n\n## Conclusion of advice\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe cases for which advice was given in 2021 comprised 16/uni00A0rejected cases, 149 approved cases and 122 cases in which approval was subject to conditions. The conditions imposed include requesting additional information, monitoring sustainability performance and engagement aimed at substantially improving sustainability performance. In 2021, second-line sustainability advice included 74 information conditions, 39 monitoring conditions and 106 engagement conditions. Approximately 5% of the requests for advice in/uni00A02021 received a negative response.\n\nAdvice on sustainability risk is provided either in the context of the client relationship as a whole or in the context of a lending relationship. The Client Acceptance, or Know Your Client (KYC), process takes place at the moment of onboarding new clients and is repeated in periodic and sometimes eventdriven client reviews. These assessments are usually done for non-lending clients, given that a more extensive sustainability assessment is performed for lending relationships. Here, too, assessments are performed at the time of loan origination and repeated in periodic (usually annual) monitoring.\n\nABN AMRO applies specific policy requirements for its lending clients in nine high-risk sectors. Each sector is divided into multiple subsectors and activities at different places in the supply chain and matched with specific requirements. The first line assesses the level of clients' compliance with these policies, and the second line in Sustainability Risk validates these assessments. If a client does not fully meet our sustainability risk policy framework, the second line will either advise negatively on the\n\nrelationship/credit or accept it subject to conditions. In most cases, conditions are set. This is in line with the bank's inclusive strategy. Conditions are set in order to become or remain comfortable that the client is moving towards full compliance and usually consist of monitoring or client engagement, or/uni00A0a combination of the two. In the absence of sufficient comfort, for example due to a major policy gap or incident, a high-intensity engagement trajectory for a maximum of three years can be started or the second line will issue a negative advice.\n\n## Climate risk management\n\nIn managing climate-related and environmental risks (CER),/uni00A0ABN AMRO is building on our sustainability risk management framework. ABN AMRO is also working on incorporating regulatory and supervisory guidance,/uni00A0such as/uni00A0the/uni00A0Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)/uni00A0framework of the/uni00A0Financial Stability Board and the/uni00A0ECB Guide on climate-related and environmental risks./uni00A0\n\nThe guidance mentioned above supports the acceleration of/uni00A0the internal review and implementation of climate risk management in the bank's governance, policies and processes. Continuous improvement is being made, based/uni00A0on new knowledge, tools and data that become available in the market.\n\nImprovements in relation to sustainability risk management in general and CER in particular are built on a structured, multi-year implementation plan. This structured approach initially focuses on several pilot portfolios, enabling the bank to build knowledge and skills that can be further leveraged throughout the organisation, in addition to leveraging on other ESG-related projects currently underway.\n\nClimate-related and environmental risk is managed in line with the bank's defined Enterprise Risk Management cycle and forms an integrated part of our sustainability risk management, as described above. The following section describes in more detail how climate risk is integrated into sustainability risk management, particularly in relation to business strategy, risk appetite, risk identification and risk measurement.\n\n## Business strategy\n\nIn defining its strategy and the structured approach for effectively/uni00A0including CER, ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses a combination of qualitative and increasingly quantitative assessments of climate-related and environmental risks and opportunities. CER are/uni00A0included, for example,/uni00A0in risk opinions for all strategic decisions. By incorporating the outcomes of the climate scenario analysis performed for the priority portfolios, the bank also ensures that strategic decisionmaking at bank and business line levels considers the impact of CER on the business environment in which the bank operates.",

By aligning CER-related Key Risk Indicators (described below) with Key/uni00A0Performance Indicators we also ensure that CER management supports this commitment.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nAs part of the structured multi-year implementation plan, the inclusion of CER in the Risk Appetite Framework is based on new insights and knowledge gained. An analysis of the impact of CER on the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement (SRAS) combined with an assessment on CER/uni00A0as a driver in existing key risk indicators (KRIs) and/or whether new CER-related KRIs are needed, is ongoing. The/uni00A0analysis is initially being undertaken for sustainability and credit risk types (in line with the EBA loan origination requirements). Analysis for other existing risk types will follow./uni00A0On CER, the risk appetite includes both quantitative and qualitative KRIs. Quantitative elements include a carbon footprint metric that measures the change in carbon intensity of the lending and investment portfolios. Qualitative elements include progress on climate-related KPIs of the business lines and progress on science-based\n\ntarget setting per sector.\n\n## Risk identification: heatmap\n\nTo identify climate risk, we follow the enterprise risk (ERM) framework, as described in the Sustainability Risk framework section./uni00A0In 2021, the bank's approach focused on updating the existing risk identification processes and policies to expand the scope with CER.\n\nFor climate risk identification, a climate risk heatmap is used to scan ABN/uni00A0AMRO's lending portfolio on sector sensitivity and vulnerability to physical and transition risks in order, among other things, to determine priority sectors for performing portfolio scenario analyses so as to assess the magnitude of the impact on selected risk types. As a formal risk identification tool, the climate risk heatmap contributes to:\n\n- H other risk identification processes (e.g. the Risk Event Register, which incorporates green policy and the transition to sustainability, extreme weather events, and/uni00A0public attention to matters involving ESG issues and/uni00A0relating to our clients);\n- H directing the assessment of whether certain climaterelated factors should be included in the credit risk ESG/uni00A0transmission channel framework;\n- H strategic decision-making by enhancing the understanding of sensitivities to climate risk in our/uni00A0portfolios.\n\nThe 2021 climate risk heatmap analyses the sensitivity of/uni00A0sub-sectors in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's corporate lending and residential mortgages portfolios to transition and physical climate risks. Improvements to the climate risk heatmap were introduced based on an internal update to the indicators in the previously used UNEP FI methodology, targeting ABN/uni00A0AMRO's portfolio instead of generic sectors and so measuring the characteristics of the sub-sectors and/uni00A0their value chains better. The heatmap is based on quantitative and qualitative data. Around 40% of the total score is now measured via externally available and quantitative data. The quantitative data covers greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity and data from the ENCORE database on ecosystem services and natural capital. A/uni00A0questionnaire is used to collect the qualitative data on the corporate lending and residential mortgages portfolios from sector experts within the bank.\n\nA specific set of sectors is in scope of the analysis. As the aim is to align with EU Sustainable Finance Regulation as much as possible, NACE classification is used as a starting point. The scope of the heatmap includes sectors that were included in the 2020 heatmap, as well as carbon-intensive sectors (NACE A-H and L). Within that scope, sub-sectors with significant exposures or a moderate to high sensitivity score in the 2020 heatmap are assessed on a more granular NACE level. The following table shows the aggregated sensitivity score of the sub-sectors for NACE level 1. The/uni00A0infographic shows the sub-sectors with moderate to high sensitivity scores in this year's heatmap on a more granular level.\n\nThe results in the high-level climate risk heatmap show that/uni00A0the highest sectoral sensitivities to climate-related risk are in the agriculture, mining and transportation sectors. The/uni00A0specification of sub-sectors shows that the largest part/uni00A0of the moderate to highly sensitive sectors (~10%) is/uni00A0represented by two sectors ('Raising of cattle' and 'Sea/uni00A0coastal freight transport'). However, other sensitive sub-sectors with smaller EAD (including 'Extraction of crude/uni00A0petroleum and natural gas' and 'Fossil electricity production') can still pose significant reputational and financial risks. The 'Not specified' box consists of corporate loans out of scope of the heatmap exercise, including exposure to financial corporations.\n\nResidential mortgages were also included in the analysis as/uni00A0part of the real estate portfolio, but are not included in/uni00A0the figures. This sub-sector has a low sensitivity score to/uni00A0transition risk and a moderately low sensitivity score to/uni00A0physical risk.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

The scope of this analysis will be based on sub-sectors' sensitivity scores and the extent of the bank's exposure in these sub-sectors. ABN/uni00A0AMRO will continuously improve the methodology to consider other elements such as time horizons, geography, and sensitivity to non-climate environmental risks, such as/uni00A0biodiversity.\n\n## Risk measurement: scenario analysis\n\nABN AMRO uses climate risk scenario analysis as one of the tools for understanding the CER impact on traditional risk types (e.g. credit risk and business risk) in specific sectors, using various climate scenarios. Priority sectors identified as part of the climate risk heatmap exercise are/uni00A0further assessed, using scenario analysis. In 2021, by/uni00A0applying a combination of qualitative and quantitative assessments, the materiality of the climate risk impact under specific scenarios materialising in the medium term (within ten years) and the long term (up to 30 years) was established for the credit risk of the portfolios in these priority sectors. For other relevant risk types (e.g. operational risk, market/liquidity risk and business risk), a/uni00A0qualitative assessment was conducted.\n\nIn 2021,/uni00A0a process and governance approach was developed in line with the bank-wide stress testing and scenario framework. This approach was applied to perform the scenario analysis in four priority portfolios selected on the basis of the 2020 climate risk heatmap/uni00A0- residential real estate, commercial real estate, energy and shipping -/uni00A0covering approximately 60% of the bank's loans to clients.\n\nClimate scenarios issued in June 2021 by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) have been selected for performing the climate scenario analysis on the four priority portfolios. These scenarios are fit for use in the tools applied in these scenario analyses and are widely recognised in the sector. The aim is to provide a common starting point for analysing climate risks under different future temperature pathways.\n\nFor the energy and shipping portfolios, the focus is on two transition risk scenarios: (a) NGFS Net Zero 2050 (orderly) and (b) NGFS Divergent Net Zero (Disorderly). For the physical risk scenario in the real estate sectors, the NGFS's Current Policies scenario has been chosen. It is acknowledged, however, that there is a dependency on the availability of data relevant for the Dutch market, where the bank's portfolio is concentrated. Information from external parties is used for this purpose. This includes climate scenarios built on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) assumptions, as well as data from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), Climate Adaptation Services (CAS) and KCAF (the Dutch expertise centre on\n\nfoundation issues). Analyses will be updated when new data from these external sources become available.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO aims to use the outcomes of the scenario analyses as input for strategic decision-making at bank and/uni00A0business line levels and for risk management purposes (e.g. risk appetite setting). The analyses performed in the four priority sectors are therefore being used as pilots to/uni00A0evaluate how to structurally integrate climate scenario analysis into the bank-wide and business line strategy and/uni00A0risk management processes.\n\nWhen performing the internal stress-testing exercise for budgeting and capital planning, we also include climateand/uni00A0environment-related events in the stress scenario assumptions. These events include the Dutch government's adopting of nitrogen measures and substantially increased financing of climate change mitigation investments.\n\nABN AMRO is currently participating in the ECB's climate stress test 2022 exercise covering the three modules, namely the questionnaire, data collection and the bottom-up stress test. The ECB considers the stress test to be a learning exercise for banks and supervisors alike, with an aim to identify vulnerabilities, best practices and the challenges banks are facing in relation to climate-related risk management. Simultaneously, ABN AMRO has developed a new climate stress test methodology, which will be embedded in internal processes to strengthen our internal climate stress test framework. The initial results of the climate stress test will be submitted to the ECB in March 2022. The ECB has communicated that the output of the climate stress test exercise will be integrated into the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), using a qualitative approach.\n\n## Scenario analysis - physical risk\n\n## Residential real estate\n\nThe 2021 scenario analysis for residential real estate assessed the materiality of credit risk driven by physical risk (i.e. flood risk and drought risk causing foundation problems due to lower ground water levels) in the Netherlands in the long term. ABN AMRO has improved the methodology used in 2020. The probability of flooding and drought problems, and the associated damage, was examined for each house in the bank's mortgage portfolio in the Netherlands (see graphs below). The bank has assessed climate risk at a loan level, with a distinction being made between direct potential repair costs (decreasing collateral value) and perception effects (negative impact on market prices).\n\nThe flooding probabilities originate from the Climate Effect Atlas (CEA), where national climate data is available at a/uni00A0more granular level, while the calculations of damage are based on the standard method provided by Deltares. The/uni00A0CEA data is based on the KNMI's WH-scenario to 2050, which is the worst-case scenario for most effects and closest to the NGFS Current Policies scenario. The\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

This same source is used to determine the repair costs associated with foundation problems. Data on the expected damage enabled the bank to test the portfolio's/uni00A0resilience to the identified climate risks.\n\nThe analysis identified certain vulnerable properties that,/uni00A0due to their energy label and low market value, are/uni00A0potentially not worth repairing if damage occurs. Two/uni00A0groups of clients who may be of particular concern were also identified: clients who may not be able to cover the costs of climate-related damage, and clients with vulnerable collateral (i.e. collateral that is not worth repairing/uni00A0if climate-related damage occurs).\n\nThe flooding in the province of Limburg in/uni00A0July 2021/uni00A0provided further data and insights on flooding risks with a limited impact for the bank, given the government's decision to declare this area a disaster zone and the financial support provided to the impacted households.\n\nIn 2021, the bank applied the initial insights to/uni00A0its risk reports/uni00A0for monitoring purposes. Particular focus was given, and will continue to be given, to determining mitigating actions, ranging from prudential measures such as provisioning and capitalisation to further securing consistent availability of high-quality data, ensuring appropriate forms of engagement with new and existing clients and mortgage advisors and assessing the underwriting criteria. We are also assessing potential mitigation measures, with the aim of creating a positive impact for the above-mentioned vulnerable clients as well as for new clients.\n\nAs a significant part of the RRE portfolio (mortgage loans) is/uni00A0used as collateral for the bank's liquidity management, the potential impact of climate risk is considered to be relevant from a liquidity perspective. For that reason, further evaluations in the context of liquidity risk management will be conducted.\n\nAs the availability and quality of data are continually improving, the 2021 analysis provides an updated overview of our portfolio. Most notably, the effect of foundation issues at/uni00A0a/uni00A0portfolio level requires further research. In/uni00A0Q4/uni00A02021, therefore, we initiated a new cycle of climate scenario analysis for the mortgage portfolio, which will benefit from updated data and more insights. The scope of/uni00A0the 2022 analysis will also cover additional physical risk/uni00A0hazards (such/uni00A0as wildfires and heat stress) and transition/uni00A0risks.\n\n## Flooding\n\nThe map shows all the properties in our RRE portfolio in the/uni00A0Netherlands and their risk of flooding within the next 30/uni00A0years.\n\n## Flooding probabilities in 2050 - RRE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the scenario analysis, the probabilities of flooding are grouped into 4 buckets: no risk, low risk, medium risk and high risk.

Most properties with foundation problems are built on peat soil and were built before 1970. High-risk properties have an estimated 30% probability of foundation problems until 2050 and, in exceptional cases, a higher probability./uni00A0As foundation risk is a slowly progressing risk, the deterioration caused by foundation problems could translate into lower market value and thus impact on LGD and RWA.\n\n## Commercial real estate\n\nThe 2021 scenario analysis for commercial real estate assessed the materiality of credit risk driven by physical risk/uni00A0(i.e. flood risk and foundation problems, caused by decreasing ground water levels) in the corporate banking, private banking and retail portfolios. As in the case of RRE, ABN/uni00A0AMRO also improved the methodology used for CRE in 2020. Once again, the bank assessed the impact on the/uni00A0collateral value of the properties in our portfolio, but this/uni00A0time extended the analysis to include an assessment of/uni00A0the revenue loss of real estate clients impacted by actual or potential damage from flooding or drought.\n\nThe data on the probabilities of flooding and foundation issues was the same as used in the RRE analysis: flooding data from Climate Effect Atlas (CEA), data on foundation issues from KCAF and calculations of/uni00A0damage based on the Deltares method.\n\nTo calculate the decline in revenue, we took a decline in rental income due to business interruption. For this we chose to assume an average of six months, based on:\n\n- 1.   the flooding risk data from CEA, showing a flood duration of up to six months for a large part of the Netherlands, and\n- 2.  the maximum interruption duration estimate of one year, according to Deltares.\n\nThe analysis estimates that the CRE portfolio will be impacted in the chosen scenario by a value reduction in the properties in our portfolio, increasing the average LtV of the portfolio by a few percentage points. The impact on a small part of our client base will be more significant, with calculated damage of around 28% (flooding) and 20% (foundation problems) of the market value.\n\nThe analysis of clients' revenue loss predicted that around half of our CRE portfolio will be impacted to some extent by a decline in rental income. This is due to our portfolio being concentrated in the most populous region of the Netherlands ('the Randstad'), which is relatively highly exposed to flooding risks and foundation problems. Further in-depth analysis of the impact on business activities, macroeconomic effects and transition risk is therefore needed.\n\nThe impact on credit risk at a portfolio and bank level may seem relatively low due to the relatively low occurrence probabilities and long-time horizons. In the event, however, of actual flooding in the area where ABN/uni00A0AMRO's portfolio is concentrated, the potential impact can be considered material. This risk is therefore being monitored by performing periodic scenario analysis.\n\n## Flooding\n\nThe following figure shows the flood risk for the building units in our portfolio (no risk is shown in green, low risk in yellow, medium risk in amber and high risk in red).\n\n## Flooding probabilities in 2050 - CRE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe estimated maximum probability of flooding occurring before 2050 is 0.13% for low risk, 13.75% for medium risk, and higher than 30% for high risk. Only 0.2% of the building units in our portfolio are located in a high-risk area.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

As foundation risk is a slowly progressing, rather than directly occurring risk, the deterioration caused by foundation problems can translate into lower market value and thus impact on LGD and RWA.\n\n## Scenario analysis - transition risk\n\n## Shipping\n\nThe 2021 shipping analysis focused on the short-, mediumand long-term credit risk driven by transition risks (resulting from such things as carbon taxation, technological innovation and the decreasing demand for fossil fuel transportation) for/uni00A0seagoing vessels in the Corporate Banking portfolio. The/uni00A0analysis assessed how these risks would impact on the/uni00A0financial performance of clients in different shipping segments (i.e. gas tankers, oil tankers, product tankers, dry/uni00A0bulk ships, container ships and multipurpose (MPP) vessels) by applying the Transition Risk Tool developed by/uni00A0the UNEP FI.\n\nThe Transition Risk Tool calculates expected losses and probability to default based on: a) the respective vessel segments'/uni00A0sensitivities to risk factors, and b) the transition readiness of individual clients, translated into an individual\n\nprobability of default calibration. The risk factors are direct and indirect emission costs, low carbon capital expenditure and change in revenue. These were qualitatively assessed based on expert opinion, the climate risk heatmap and the/uni00A0ESG Transmission Channel Framework. The transition readiness was based on company-specific information on/uni00A0investments in new technologies, ESG reporting and strategy, and the average greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rating of a client's fleet. The tool did not assess the impact on loss given default (LGD), which is key in credit risk assessments in this sector. LGD-focused tools are not yet available in the market, but we will continue to monitor developments in this respect.\n\nIn both scenarios, the increase in expected losses for all shipping segments was considered acceptable. The tanker segments would be impacted most because the current world fleet would be larger than projected demand for fossil/uni00A0fuel transportation in the chosen scenario. Exposure in this segment needs to be particularly closely monitored to ensure the potential losses remain acceptable.The medium-term impacts (within 10 years) were greater, but still limited relative to our total exposure to the sector in the NGFS Divergent Net Zero scenario. This scenario projects accelerated decarbonisation in Europe and the transportation sector, thus exposing our portfolio to higher risk than in/uni00A0the/uni00A0orderly NGFS Net Zero scenario.\n\nThe results will be used as input for multiple processes. Trends in alternative fuels and emission-reducing ship design will be part of our intensified engagement with clients. In addition, climate transition risks and identified criteria for adaptive capacity will be integrated into the/uni00A0credit analysis and decisioning process. The main outcomes will also be translated into the sector's climate transition strategy.\n\n## Energy\n\nIn 2020, the energy climate scenario analysis focused on the upstream oil and gas portfolio. In 2021, we extended the scope of this scenario analysis to include the off-shore services and power generation portfolios. The purpose of the analysis was to assess the materiality of credit and business risk driven by transition risk in these portfolios for/uni00A0the short, medium and long term. The Net Zero 2050 and Divergent Net Zero scenarios of the NGFS that were chosen for this analysis allowed us to assess the impact of/uni00A0a more 'extreme' decarbonisation scenario than the IEA/uni00A0Sustainable Development Scenario used in the 2020/uni00A0analysis.\n\nThe scenario analysis consists of both a quantitative and a/uni00A0qualitative analysis. For the quantitative analysis we used/uni00A0the same Transition Risk Tool as used in the shipping analysis to assess the impact on creditworthiness (PD) and/uni00A0expected loss (EL) of the portfolio.

The output of this qualitative analysis served as borrower-level input for the Transition Risk Tool calculations.\n\nThe analysis of the three energy sectors predicted a limited impact of transition risk on credit risk in our energy portfolio. This is mainly explained by the geographical characteristics of the client portfolio, which translate into a portfolio with low operational costs, low CO2 intensities and limited exposure to exploration, all of which seem to mitigate transition risk factors. The analysis also showed that a number of our clients are already diversifying or are due to start activities in renewable energy technologies, suggesting that they are well-positioned for the energy transition.\n\nAs ABN/uni00A0AMRO has strategic ambitions to grow its renewable energy project finance portfolio in solar, wind and biomass, an assessment was performed on the renewable energy portfolio to identify potential risks (merchant and technology risks) and the potential impact on/uni00A0the business model associated with portfolio growth on/uni00A0the pathway to becoming Paris-aligned. The analysis also/uni00A0provided insights into the conditions and choices needed (in terms of growth, risks and policy framework) to/uni00A0support further growth in the renewable energy portfolio. The scenario analysis results will be considered in strategic decision-making on our energy business and its impact on our business model.\n\nConsidering the pace of market developments and the everchanging scenario assumptions, we will perform a follow-up scenario analysis on the oil and gas upstream, midstream and offshore portfolio in order to monitor exposure to transition risk. We will further refine the criteria defined for client level\n\nadaptability (based on materiality) and consider including these criteria in our client sustainability due diligence and/uni00A0our credit-decisioning process.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nBased on the chosen scenarios, climate risk drivers and time horizons (2030 and 2050), the outcome of the climate scenario analyses of the four priority portfolios indicates that it is unlikely that climate risk will have a material impact on credit risk in the priority portfolios.\n\n## GHG measuring and steering\n\nIn line with the bank's climate objectives and strategic risk appetite on the alignment of our portfolio with the Paris Agreement, we measure the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our activities. This includes the direct (scope 1 and 2 and partly scope 3) emissions of our own operations and the indirect emissions in our lending and asset management portfolios. In doing so, we focus on GHG/ carbon-intensive sectors in particular, and assess the alignment of certain GHG-intensive portfolios with Paris and/uni00A0net zero emissions scenarios.\n\nThe lending portfolio's emissions are calculated in accordance with the principles set by the Platform Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). These combine various sources of information, including company-level emissions data (for stock exchange-listed corporate clients) and average carbon intensities by energy label (for residential mortgages and commercial real estate) and by sector (for/uni00A0other corporates). We updated our methodology and/uni00A0data sources in 2021. Among other changes, we now/uni00A0use emission estimates on NACE level 4 for some carbon-intensive sectors and apply an attribution factor for residential mortgages. This resulted in an overall increase in/uni00A0estimated GHG emissions. The/uni00A0comparative figures on/uni00A0GHG emissions have been adjusted accordingly.\n\n## GHG emissions summary\n\n| (in ktons)                                       | 2021   | 2020   | Delta   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Total scope 1 1                                  | 3      | 6      | -2      |\n| Total scope 2 2                                  | 3      | 3      |         |\n| Total scope 3 - own operations 3                 | 47     | 1      | 45      |\n| Total scope 3 - emissions of lending portfolio 4 | 19,743 | 34,536 | -14,793 |\n| Total scope 3 - emissions of client assets 5     | 6,498  | 6,633  | -135    |\n| Total GHG emissions                              | 26,294 | 41,180 | -14,886 |\n\n- 1 Natural gas/biogas, solar energy (the Netherlands and rest of world) and mobility lease cars (Netherlands).\n- 2 Electricity (excluding solar energy) and heating & cooling, location based figures provided by energy suppliers (the Netherlands and rest of world).\n- 3 Compared to 2020, there is an increase as scope 3 GHG emissions now include GHG emissions for home workplace, air travel, international business rail travel, hotel visits, mobility, public transport and IT.

The largest decline was in the mining and quarrying sector (EUR/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion), mainly because of sales of oil and gas assets in the USA, followed by a decline of EUR/uni00A00.8/uni00A0billion and EUR/uni00A00.4/uni00A0billion in the manufacturing and electricity sectors. The year-on-year\n\nchange in the total corporate loan book was much smaller, at EUR/uni00A00.3/uni00A0billion. This was due to growth in the commercial real estate (EUR/uni00A02/uni00A0billion), construction (EUR/uni00A01.2/uni00A0billion) and renewable energy (EUR/uni00A00.6/uni00A0billion) loan/uni00A0books, which exceeded the decline in the trade and commodity finance (EUR/uni00A02.4/uni00A0billion) and shipping (EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion) non-core loan portfolios.",

In the case of corporate clients, ABN/uni00A0AMRO is only allowed to use actual information that has been disclosed by clients reporting under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). These clients have not yet reported on eligibility or will do so around the same time as ABN/uni00A0AMRO has to issue this report.

We distinguish between NFRD and nonNFRD corporates, as the former will provide actual eligibility information on which to base our mandatory disclosures next year, while the latter will not as they do not yet have a/uni00A0regulatory obligation to do so. We have included our non-NFRD corporates in the following figure to indicate the nature of our exposures to these counterparties, given that financing provided to this population will remain crucial in transitioning to a lower-carbon economy.\n\n1",

This means that these activities significantly contribute to a taxonomy objective, meet the/uni00A0'do no significant harm' (DNSH) criteria and meet the/uni00A0minimum safeguards criteria. To assess whether the/uni00A0activities that we finance are aligned we are highly dependent on the information that our clients disclose, as/uni00A0required by the NFRD, and in the future as required by/uni00A0the CSRD when it comes into force.\n\nBased on the information that our clients disclose, and in/uni00A0line with current regulatory requirements, we aim to disclose the GAR in our 2023 Annual Report. We are only allowed to include the taxonomy-aligned exposures to NFRD corporates, certain household exposures and specific local government financing in the numerator. This means that a significant amount of our portfolio (such as lending\n\nto/uni00A0and ABN/uni00A0AMRO's investments in non-NFRD corporates and financial institutions, amounting to 30.1% of our total assets) cannot be considered for taxonomy alignment and will subsequently be excluded from the GAR numerator in the 2023 Annual Report. Non-NFRD corporates may only be/uni00A0included in the numerator from the 2024 Annual Report, subject to positive assessment of this by the European Commission.\n\nThe denominator of the GAR is based on the concept\n\nof/uni00A0covered assets, which includes/uni00A0total on-balance sheet assets less exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers and assets held for trading. This amounted to EUR 302.9 billion at 31 December 2021. In future, we will aim to align our definitions for sustainable acceleration loans as much as possible with the EU taxonomy definitions. However, we also see the need for additional sustainability-related metrics to cover the clients and exposures, such as our SME portfolio that cannot be/uni00A0included in the GAR from a regulatory point of view.\n\n## Client asset portfolio\n\n31 December 2021\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)        |        |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Potential eligible assets 1 | 90,828 |\n| - of which NFRD clients     | 36,702 |\n| - of which eligible 2       | 13,340 |\n| - of which non-eligible     | 23,362 |\n\n- 1 Scope consists of corporate debt and equity securities, including lookthrough of funds.\n- 2 Eligibility is based on the principal economic activity of the counterparty.\n\nGiven the materiality and strategic importance of our client asset portfolio, ABN AMRO has chosen to also disclose the/uni00A0potential eligibility for this portfolio and the share of client assets invested in NFRD clients, ahead of the future KPI from the Taxonomy Delegated Act with regard to assets under management.\n\n1",

Insights into our Risk management governance processes and control systems for 2021.\n- B. External factors that potentially impact ABN AMRO's current business model.\n- C. Areas at risk of non-compliance with regulations and/uni00A0heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n- D. Areas of attention for ABN AMRO identified by senior/uni00A0management.\n\n## Section A: Risk Management Governance\n\nABN AMRO's internal risk management and control process is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:\n\n- H Strategic and business objectives;\n- H Compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies;\n- H Reliability of financial and non-financial information;\n- H Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; and\n- H Safeguarding of assets, and identification and management of liabilities.\n\nABN AMRO's first and second lines of defence perform a variety of tests and controls - risk assessments, stress/uni00A0tests, evaluations on effectiveness of controls, and/uni00A0reporting - on risk management and control systems. The/uni00A0results are reported in formal risk reports and discussed at senior management level.\n\nGroup Audit, as the third line of defence, evaluates the design and effectiveness of ABN AMRO's governance, as well as its Risk Management and Control Systems. In 2021, the Audit reports were discussed with relevant Executive Committee members. Group Audit attended the Executive Board and/or Executive Committee meetings every quarter to discuss the Quarterly Audit Opinions.\n\nLast year, the evaluation of the adequacy of ABN AMRO's internal risk management and control systems was regularly discussed with the Audit Committee, the Risk & Capital Committee and the full Supervisory Board.\n\nOn an annual basis the Executive Board makes the following Statements and provides clear substantiation regarding the internal risk management and control systems. This is always done in accordance with ABN AMRO's moderate risk profile (in compliance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the Corporate Governance Code and based on ABN AMRO's risk management processes):\n\n- H An integral part of the Integrated Annual Report 2021 is the Executive Board's Report, which provides insight into any failings in the effectiveness of the Internal Risk Management and Control Systems (best practice 1.4.3.i);\n- H The internal risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting for 2021 does not contain any material inaccuracies (best/uni00A0practice 1.4.3.ii);\n- H Based on the current state of affairs, preparation of the financial reporting for 2021 on a going-concern basis is justified (best practice 1.4.3.iii). For further information, please refer to Note 1 Accounting policies in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements;\n- H The Executive Board's report states those material risks and uncertainties that may affect ABN AMRO's continuity for the 12-month period following the preparation of this report (best practice 1.4.3.iv);\n- H The Executive Board's report outlines the bank's values, and how they are incorporated into the activities of the bank and its affiliated enterprises. It discusses the bank's compliance with the Code of Conduct (best practice 2.5.4). For more information, please refer to the Risk framework section.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Section B: Potential external factors\n\nExternal factors have the potential to affect the bank's current business model. In addition to the impact of Covid-19, the Executive Board has identified the following external factors as potential risks:\n\n- H Covid-19 update:\n- H The economic growth that took place in 2021 was higher than expected. However, at the end of 2021 the bank was again confronted with new (economic) uncertainties.\n- H The bank's strong digital backbone, combined with the dedication and flexibility of its staff, ensured services to clients remained consistent.\n- H The bank strengthened its risk management activities and reporting during this period, partly in response to increased regulatory requirements. Additionally, the bank's models are being recalibrated\n- in response to these exceptional circumstances.\n- H The bank's business continuity measures with respect to Covid-19 were effective in 2021.\n- H In December 2021, the rising number of infections due to the Omicron variant pushed the Netherlands and other countries where the bank operates, back into partial lockdowns. Due to the new variant, economic uncertainty has increased, and complete recovery will take longer. The bank remains concerned about the long-term impact on society.\n- H However, on a positive note, high vaccination rates in the eurozone/US have weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations.\n- H Adverse macroeconomic and monetary conditions could hinder the bank in achieving its planned growth strategies. Developments include:\n- H Persistently low or negative interest rates.\n- H Reformed fiscal policies.\n- H Geopolitical uncertainty (such as the Russia-Ukraine war and trade tensions between the US and China).\n- H Competition (for instance pressure on the bank's market share in mortgages).\n- H A degree of economic recovery has taken place since the beginning of the pandemic. But to date, supply cannot keep up with growing demand, resulting in increasing inflation.\n- H A number of new laws and regulations could have an/uni00A0impact on the bank's strategy, revenues, costs and/uni00A0capital adequacy. Examples include:\n- H GDPR and more specifically clarity provided by/uni00A0the/uni00A0Schrems II verdict.\n- H Sustainable finance regulations.\n- \u00c5 Given that sustainability is an important pillar of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's purpose and strategy, it was encouraging to see an increase in sustainable developments. These developments are closely monitored as regulators continue to challenge banks to comply with all emerging legislation.\n- Similarly, all stakeholders are increasingly expecting companies to transition to sustainability.\n\nThe bank welcomes the first part of the EU Taxonomy guidance to assess the relevant asset categories against the new green standards.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is expected to provide a common methodology and language in the market to define which/uni00A0activities from the bank are sustainable. When calculating the Green Asset Ratio (in line with the definitions included in the EU Taxonomy Regulation) ABN/uni00A0AMRO may be perceived as less sustainable compared to previous disclosures, which are based on/uni00A0the current internal definitions used for determining sustainable (acceleration) assets. It is expected that this/uni00A0development will be industry-wide, as these stricter sustainability criteria will apply to all banks.\n\nIn addition, the bank needs time to adapt, validate and audit its processes and systems to facilitate the sourcing of data to determine the extent to which the bank and our clients' activities are sustainable.\n\nFinally, developments in the field of sustainability could impact several risk types in the short to long term. For/uni00A0more information, please refer to the Sustainability risk section.\n\nThe Executive Board took a strategic decision to define client segments and develop value propositions to compensate and minimise the impact of these external factors.\n\n## For example:\n\n- \u00c5 A more client centric fee-based business model;\n- \u00c5 Simplifying and centralising the operating model.\n\nNot being compliant with laws and regulations may lead to/uni00A0reputational damage, fines and changes in ABN AMRO's income, costs or capital basis, all of which could endanger its long-term goals.\n\nEnsuring demonstrable compliance requires robust risk governance, enhanced data management and a substantial share of the bank's resources.",

In 2021, ABN AMRO Bank accepted the settlement offer from the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service (NPPS) in connection with their investigation into ABN AMRO's shortcomings in Anti-Money Laundering activities from 2014 to 2020.\n\nIn 2021, the bank made progress in addressing compliance issues and strengthening its compliance function. NPPS also acknowledged that in 2018 ABN/uni00A0AMRO created the AML programme to remediate all identified shortcomings. ABN AMRO will continue to/uni00A0make every effort to fulfil its role as gatekeeper.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Performance section in the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter.\n\n- H Duty of care towards the bank's clients. In regard to the bank's duty of care, the goals of ABN AMRO and expectations of external stakeholders - including clients, politicians and media - are increasingly high. The bank is working hard to meet these expectations, and has responded by implementing a bank-wide Duty of Care Programme and bank-wide Client Centricity Principles.\n\nVariable interest rates . The bank is seeing an increased risk of claims and liability regarding loan products with variable interest rates. This has resulted in client compensation arrangements for certain revolving consumer credits. Residual claim and liability risks remain, both in relation to revolving credits and other types of loan products with variable interest rates. The/uni00A0bank continues to monitor these risks and the use/uni00A0of/uni00A0variable interest rates going forward.\n\nFor more information, please refer to Customer experience in the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter.\n\n- H Credit Risk Management. Collateral management, credit risk monitoring, credit modelling and reporting all/uni00A0require remediation.\n\nMore information on this is provided in the Credit risk management section.\n\nRemediation programmes - related to Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF), Duty of Care and Credit Risk Management - aimed at improving ABN AMRO's performance were well underway in 2021. These programmes have reduced shortcomings and aim to ensure full compliance with legislation.\n\nIn 2019, the bank has amongst others:\n\n- 1.   Established a centralised AML Department.\n- 2.  Set up programmes to address potential issues involving products sold in the past (such as consumer credit and/uni00A0mortgages).\n- 3.  Improved the monitoring of regulatory changes and/uni00A0implementation.\n\nThe remediation requires a substantial, ongoing effort, especially the regulatory areas mentioned above.\n\nIn addition to its remediation programmes, the bank continues to improve compliance in all operational processes.\n\nIn the past, ABN AMRO's legal predecessor, Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V., ABN AMRO and several (former) subsidiaries were directly or indirectly involved in transactions relating to equity trading extending over dividend record dates, including several forms of tainted dividend arbitrage, i.e. dividend stripping.\n\nIt cannot be excluded that ABN AMRO or subsidiaries may face financial consequences as a result of their involvement in these transactions. This could include penalties and other measures under both criminal and civil law claims. The bank has been implementing measures to prevent any future involvement in tainted dividend arbitrage.\n\nFor more information, please refer to Note 35 Commitments and contingent liabilities in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Section D: Areas of attention identified by senior management\n\nThe Executive Board has identified and agreed on the following 6 areas of improvement, which are being actively managed by senior management:\n\n- 1. Increased cyber risks: Cyber-attacks are an increasing external threat. They have the potential to lock or destroy our systems, steal data or (temporarily) put us out of service for clients and third parties. To reduce this risk, the bank is focusing on 3 key issues:\n- H Making sure ABN AMRO has the correct controls to/uni00A0protect the bank's systems. For example identity and access management;\n- H Making sure ABN AMRO can detect and respond to/uni00A0an attack;\n- H Making sure ABN AMRO can recover quickly if an attack happens.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "Achieving this will make our systems much more robust. However, substantial efforts are still required to improve the IT infrastructure, which is complex due to the existing number of legacy systems and multiple third party applications.\n\n- 2. Data management and privacy: The financial services industry is becoming increasingly data driven. In order to meet the Principles for Effective Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting, the bank urgently needs to improve its data quality and availability.\n\nAdditionally the quality of (historical) data, data ownership, data knowledge and a complex IT infrastructure all need to be addressed. Otherwise, these data issues may result in poor decision-making and poor business process execution, as well as elevated model risk causing capital add-ons.\n\nData management and data leakage play an important role in addressing privacy risk and will require sustained, ongoing efforts./uni00A0\n\n- 3. Change accumulation: The complexity, and interdependencies of the bank's transformation programmes - including improvement of Risk Management capabilities are leading to an accumulation of change risk. The recent changes in the bank's top structure and the announced changes in the Client Unit organisation (for instance implementation of Clients Units, Product Engines) should simplify and enhance change execution in the future. However, these changes could have a negative impact on the people side in the short term. For/uni00A0example: role changes, key knowledge gaps, job uncertainty, lack of focus on execution, etc.\n\nThis may potentially cause delays, increase operational costs and time-to-market issues - all of which would put ABN AMRO at a competitive disadvantage. To mitigate this, the new Leadership Team needs to:\n\n- H Prioritise key change requests to deliver on time;\n- H Improve Change Portfolio management capabilities.\n\nTo finish on a positive note, the wind-down of the Corporate & Institutional Banking non-core client portfolio to pursue the bank's moderate risk profile is progressing ahead of plan.\n\n- 4. External fraud: The bank as well as its clients were confronted with payment and loan/credit frauds and losses in 2021, in particular related to impersonation scams.\n\nABN AMRO collaborates with public and private partners in order to adapt to the rapidly-changing fraud landscape and protect our clients and the bank itself against fraud.\n\nThis should improve the digital resilience of our clients. For more information, please refer to the Operational (non-financial) risk section.\n\nIn early 2021, the banking sector agreed to compensate consumers who are victims of certain types of payment fraud, even when banks are formally not liable. An extended and voluntary compensation scheme was agreed by the sector, following appeals by various stakeholders such as members of parliament, media and consumer organisations.\n\nThe exact scope and application of the compensation scheme has differed between banks throughout 2021, leading to increased attention for banks (including ABN/uni00A0AMRO) that allegedly were less generous than others. ABN AMRO decided in late 2021 to extend its offer to affected consumers, and compensate certain additional fraud victims despite these victims having breached the security clauses in their contracts.\n\nExtensive additional awareness campaigns have been/uni00A0launched by ABN/uni00A0AMRO and by the sector. However, the course of public debate around payment fraud remains uncertain.\n\nTo strengthen our fraud risk management framework for/uni00A0internal and external fraud we issued a new Fraud risk/uni00A0policy and will continue to improve our fraud controls and fraud risk reporting.\n\n- 5. People and culture: The difficulties of attracting, developing and retaining qualified and diverse staff remain a challenge, especially in areas of IT and data. This is especially true in the current context of strategic change and pandemic fatigue.\n\nThis combination, plus the ongoing urgencies of safeguarding our license to operate and working remotely, demands huge efforts to ensure staff resilience, motivation and wellbeing.\n\nEfforts are being made to mitigate these risks through carefully managed HR programmes which focus on strategic workforce management, reskilling and wellbeing.\n\nHR also works closely with the business lines to:\n\n- H Enhance performance management practices;\n- H Ensure strategy execution also focuses on leadership and supporting people during change;\n- H Strengthen client-centric ways of working;\n- H Define the new departments following the new top/uni00A0structure;\n- H Improve hybrid ways of working.",

Risk Control Framework: The effectiveness of the/uni00A0Risk/uni00A0Control Framework is under continuous improvement via the Risk Management Foundation Plan. More attention is also being paid to the underlying conduct drivers, such as clarity, achievability and engagement.\n\nIn the meantime, measures have been taken to minimise and mitigate the risks with regard to all areas of improvement.\n\nIt should be noted that ABN AMRO's internal risk management and control systems do not provide complete assurance on the realisation of business objectives, nor do they prevent or detect inaccuracies, fraud/uni00A0and non-compliance with rules and regulations at/uni00A0all/uni00A0times.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

These models cover residential mortgages, consumer and corporate loans, non-maturing assets (mainly current accounts), credit cards,/uni00A0non-maturing liabilities (demand deposits and current/uni00A0accounts) and term deposits. The liquidity risk models/uni00A0predict the behavioural cash flows, which can differ/uni00A0from/uni00A0the contractual cash flows as a result of, for example,/uni00A0prepayments or because some products do not/uni00A0have a/uni00A0defined contractual maturity date. The models are based/uni00A0on historically observed client behaviour and use/uni00A0a combination of internal and external risk drivers. The/uni00A0models are used for monitoring the bank's liquidity mismatch position.\n\nThe liquidity risk models are included in the bank's model risk management framework. This means that the models have to follow a regular monitoring and validation schedule. Approval of the models is given by the Methodology Acceptance Group (MAG) ALM/T, based on independent advice from Model Validation.\n\n1",

ABN/uni00A0AMRO transformed its former four business lines (Retail Banking, Private Banking, Commercial Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking) into three client units, each headed by a Chief Commercial Officer/uni00A0(CCO).\n\nAs part of the new simplified organisational setup, the former Executive Committee ceased to exist as of the Extraordinary General Meeting of 24 November 2021 in favour of an extended composition of the Executive Board, simplifying the top management structure of the bank. Until/uni00A0the Extraordinary General Meeting of 24 November 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO's management structure included an Executive Board and an Executive Committee.\n\nThe former CEOs of Private Banking and Retail Banking, Pieter van Mierlo and Frans van der Horst respectively, left the Executive Committee concurrent with the discontinuation of the Executive Committee.\n\nOn 9 June 2021, Daphne de Kluis, the CEO of Commercial Banking and a member of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Executive Committee at that time, announced her intention to pursue her career outside ABN/uni00A0AMRO as of 1 September 2021. Patrick Pfaff was subsequently appointed as interim CEO of/uni00A0Commercial Banking and member of the Executive Committee as of 1 September.\n\nOn 11 October 2021, the CEO of Corporate & Institutional Banking and a member of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Executive Committee at that time, Rutger van Nouhuijs, announced that he would pursue his career outside ABN/uni00A0AMRO and handed over his responsibilities on an interim basis to Dan Dorner, the intended CCO of Corporate Banking, to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nOn 24 November 2021, the Supervisory Board made the following appointments as of the close of the Extraordinary General Meeting on that day:\n\n- H Choy van der Hooft-Cheong as the new CCO of Wealth Management and member of the Executive Board of ABN/uni00A0AMRO;\n- H Dan Dorner as CCO of Corporate Banking and member of the Executive Board of ABN/uni00A0AMRO; and\n- H Gerard Penning (already Chief Human Resources Manager at the time) as member of the Executive Board of ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\nThe Employee Council and NLFI issued a positive advice on the aforementioned appointments.\n\nIn 2021, a search process for a new CCO of Personal & Business Banking and member of the Executive Board was initiated and resulted in the appointment of Annerie Vreugdenhil as of 1 March 2022. Interim arrangements were put in place for the period until the appointment (and/uni00A0start) of Annerie Vreugdenhil as the new CCO of Personal & Business Banking and member of the Executive Board to ensure continuity of decision-making.\n\nIn addition, on 7 January 2022, ABN/uni00A0AMRO announced that/uni00A0Christian Bornfeld, CI&TO of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and ViceChair of the Executive Board, will leave ABN/uni00A0AMRO with effect from 1 May 2022. He will pursue a new opportunity that will allow him to work closer to his family in Denmark. The/uni00A0Supervisory Board has initiated the process of finding a/uni00A0new CI&TO.\n\n## Role and responsibilities of the Executive Board\n\nThe Executive Board is the statutory managing board of ABN/uni00A0AMRO within the meaning of Section 2:129 of the Dutch Civil Code. It is responsible for (i) the general course of business of ABN/uni00A0AMRO, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations and the adequate financing of its activities; (ii) the continuity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business, aimed at long-term value creation for ABN/uni00A0AMRO and taking into account interests of stakeholders, and (iii) setting ABN/uni00A0AMRO's mission, vision, strategy, risk appetite, corporate standards and values, risk framework, main policies, budgets, financial and non-financial targets, and for/uni00A0the realisation thereof.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "Until the discontinuation of the Executive Committee, in/uni00A0respect of these duties, and to the extent they related to/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its subsidiaries, the Executive Board consulted the Executive Committee, without prejudice to/uni00A0the Executive Board's statutory collective management responsibilities. The Executive Board was also required to consult the Executive Committee regarding the strategic direction of the bank.\n\nThe Executive Board ensures close cooperation with the Supervisory Board in the discharge of its responsibilities and seeks the approval of the Supervisory Board for the bank-wide strategy (in line with the pursued culture aimed at long-term value creation) and targets. The Executive Board is accountable to the Supervisory Board and to the General Meeting for the performance of its duties. In performing its duties, the Executive Board develops a view on long-term value creation for ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business and considers relevant stakeholder interests.\n\n## Role and responsibilities of the former Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nWith the simplification of our top structure, the former Executive Committee ceased to exist as of the Extraordinary General Meeting of 24 November 2021. The Executive Board has taken over the duties and responsibilities of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Executive Committee.\n\nUntil, however, the discontinuation of the Executive Committee, the Executive Committee was part of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's 'management body' (together with the Executive Board and Supervisory Board), as defined in CRD, and had duties and responsibilities that had been delegated to it by the Executive Board. The Executive Committee was entrusted with the effective direction of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its subsidiaries. The Executive Committee was specifically mandated to ensure that ABN/uni00A0AMRO's mission, vision, strategy, policies, annual budget, risk appetite, standards and values, and financial and non-financial targets were translated into specific group-aligned strategies, policies, budgets, risk appetites, standards and performance targets for each business line, with the aim of contributing to longterm value creation by ABN/uni00A0AMRO, and building and maintaining the culture required for that purpose. The/uni00A0respective members of the Executive Committee were also responsible for the daily management of their own business lines.\n\nIn addition, the Executive Committee helped define the strategic direction of the bank: the Executive Board was required to consult the Executive Committee in respect of/uni00A0decisions regarding the bank's (i) mission, vision and strategy, and (ii) risk policies, risk appetite framework and statement. The Executive Committee ensured an open dialogue with the Supervisory Board, both on specific issues and in general, in order to inform the Supervisory\n\nBoard adequately. The Executive Committee provided the/uni00A0Supervisory Board and its committees with all the information they needed for the proper performance of their supervisory duties and as requested by the Supervisory Board through the Chair of the Executive Committee.\n\n## Composition and diversity\n\nAs of 24 November 2021, the Executive Board consists of/uni00A0the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Innovation & Technology Officer (CI&TO), the Client Unit representatives (CCO of Personal & Business Banking, CCO/uni00A0of Corporate Banking and CCO of Wealth Management) and a Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO).\n\nThe Executive Board's composition is based on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's guiding principle that diversity of thought, expertise, background, competences and interpersonal styles is a prerequisite for effective management and, by extension, for long-term value creation. The vision set by ABN/uni00A0AMRO is for it to become a company that mirrors, at/uni00A0all levels, the diversity of the communities in which it operates. This means fostering a variety of views and experiences and facilitating independent opinions and sound decision-making within the Executive Board. To that effect, the following diversity aspects have been identified as relevant for the composition of the Executive Board: gender, age, educational and professional background and geographical provenance./uni00A0These aspects were also taken into consideration for appointments and reappointments in/uni00A02021.\n\nIn line with ABN AMRO's diversity policy, ABN AMRO strives to meet the applicable gender target. In 2021, this target was at least 30% for the Executive Board. As of 1/uni00A0January 2022, the Act on Gender Balance in Management and Supervisory Boards (Wet evenwichtiger verhouding tussen mannen en vrouwen in bestuur en raad van commissarissen) came into force. The Act imposes an ingrowth quota of at least one-third male and one-third female members on the supervisory boards of Dutch companies listed in the Netherlands. In addition, ABN AMRO has to have drawn up appropriate and ambitious targets to promote gender diversity across the organisation and is required to report on the above targets and plans, and the progress made in this regard. ABN AMRO is in the process of implementing the new targets in its diversity policy./uni00A0Gender diversity within the Executive Board at 8/uni00A0March 2022 is 37.5%. When vacancies arise and in succession planning, ABN AMRO gives due consideration to any applicable diversity requirements in its search for suitable new members who meet the fit and proper requirements stipulated in the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act.",

Due to the changes in the corporate governance structure, the Executive Board amended these rules in 2021 to reflect the new organisational structure.\n\n## Appointment, suspension and dismissal\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are appointed and reappointed by the Supervisory Board for a term of up to four years, provided that the term of office continues up to and including the first General Meeting to be held after expiry of the term. When preparing the appointment and reappointment of the members of the Executive Board, the Selection and Nomination Committee and the Supervisory Board consider the diversity objectives laid down in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's internal policies. Only candidates who meet the fit and proper test under the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act are eligible for appointment.\n\nThe Employee Council provides advice on the appointment of members of the Executive Board.

        "page_content": "## Supervisory Board composition\n\n## Role and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises, advises, challenges and supports the Executive Board (and until its discontinuation also did so with respect to the Executive Committee) in the/uni00A0exercise of its powers and duties. Together with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board is responsible for ABN/uni00A0AMRO's long-term value creation, requiring members to execute their duties in a sustainable manner with due observance of the long-term viability of the strategy being pursued. In discharging its task, the Supervisory Board takes into account the dynamics and the relationship between the Executive Board (and until its discontinuation also the Executive Committee) and its members. The Supervisory Board's early and close involvement with the Executive Board is required when formulating the bankwide strategy and targets in line with the pursued culture aimed at long-term value creation.\n\nIn performing their duties, the members of the Supervisory Board are guided by the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its businesses, taking due consideration of the legitimate interests of all of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's stakeholders (such as its clients, savers and deposit holders, shareholders, holders of/uni00A0depositary receipts, employees and the society in which/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates). Certain decisions taken by/uni00A0the Executive Board are subject to the approval of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Supervisory Board.\n\n## Changes in 2021\n\nOn 15 November 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO announced that Jurgen Stegmann had decided for personal reasons to resign as a/uni00A0member of the Supervisory Board with immediate effect.\n\n## Appointment, suspension and dismissal\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting, following nomination by the Supervisory Board itself. Only candidates who have passed the fit and proper test under the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act are eligible for appointment. The General Meeting and the Employee Council may recommend candidates to the Supervisory Board to be nominated as members of the Supervisory Board. The diversity objectives laid down in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's internal policies are taken into consideration when preparing the appointment and reappointment of the members of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board notifies the General Meeting of the intended appointment or reappointment of a member of the Supervisory Board, accompanied by a short resume of the candidate, including the candidate's age, gender, educational and professional background and geographical provenance.\n\nIn accordance with the best practice provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, Supervisory Board members are appointed for a period ending at the close of the first Annual General Meeting held after four years have passed since their last appointment, unless a shorter period was set at the time of the appointment. The Supervisory Board is required to nominate a candidate recommended by/uni00A0the Employee Council in respect of one third of the members of the Supervisory Board (the 'enhanced recommendation right'). The Supervisory Board must accept the recommendation of the Employee Council unless it believes that the candidate recommended is unsuitable to fulfil the duties of a member of the Supervisory Board or if the Supervisory Board would not/uni00A0be/uni00A0properly composed if the appointment was made as/uni00A0recommended.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may suspend any of its members at/uni00A0any time. The General Meeting may dismiss the Supervisory Board in its entirety in the event of lack of confidence in the Supervisory Board. This requires an absolute majority of the votes cast, representing a quorum of at least one third of the issued share capital. If this quorum is not met, there is no possibility to hold a second General Meeting at which no quorum applies. Further information on the suspension and dismissal procedure is/uni00A0provided in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Articles of Association and the/uni00A0Supervisory Board Rules of Procedure as published on/uni00A0the ABN/uni00A0AMRO website.\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has established four committees to prepare its decision-making and to advise the Supervisory Board on specific matters. These committees are composed exclusively of Supervisory Board members.\n\nThese committees are the:\n\n- H Audit Committee;\n- H Risk & Capital Committee;\n- H Remuneration Committee;\n- H Selection & Nomination Committee.\n\n## Composition and diversity\n\nThe Supervisory Board's composition is based on the guiding principle that diversity of thought, expertise, background, competences and interpersonal styles is a prerequisite for effective supervision and, by extension, for/uni00A0long-term value creation. To that effect, the following diversity aspects have been identified as relevant for the/uni00A0composition of the Supervisory Board: gender, age, educational and professional background and geographical provenance.",

As of 1/uni00A0January 2022, the Act on Gender Balance in Management and Supervisory Boards (Wet evenwichtiger verhouding tussen mannen en vrouwen in bestuur en raad van commissarissen) came into force. The Act imposes an ingrowth quota of at least one-third male and one-third female members on the supervisory boards of Dutch companies listed in the Netherlands. For every appointment to its Supervisory Board, therefore,/uni00A0ABN AMRO must assess whether the above ingrowth quota is maintained. Gender diversity within ABN AMRO's Supervisory Board was 43% at 31 December 2021.

How do you think the bank is dealing with this crisis, both at Executive Board level and in terms of serving clients?\n\nThe essence of being a bank is that you are there for your clients, and that your clients have access to your products and services at all times, without any hitches. ABN AMRO was able to provide that service during the Covid-19 pandemic, and is navigating through the crisis well.\n\nJust like in other sectors, clients are increasingly doing their business with banks digitally, a trend which was already clear before the start of the pandemic, and which has increased since. For a bank, it's of the utmost importance never to forget there's an actual person behind every click. I/uni00A0am pleased that ABN AMRO is investing in its digital offering, but also in making sure our less digitally savvy clients are included in this development.\n\n## What has been the impact of the pandemic on the/uni00A0bank's employees, and on the culture within the/uni00A0organisation?\n\nI cannot emphasise enough how exemplary the bank's employees are in their flexibility. Some employees - for instance young people - are finding it difficult to continuously work from home, though. Management is alert to these signals and the bank has programmes in place that devote attention to the wellbeing of our staff.\n\nIn line with the bank's values - care, courage and collaboration - a lot of attention is being paid to open communication and being able to speak your mind. This/uni00A0has become even more important in a time when colleagues are working from home and there is less in-person contact. We need to keep an eye out for everyone.\n\n## ABN AMRO accepted a EUR 480 million settlement with the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service for being insufficiently successful in fulfilling its role as a gatekeeper aimed at combating money laundering. How do you view this from your perspective as a supervisory director?\n\nThis was obviously very upsetting. Before the settlement, ABN AMRO had decided to centralise and invest in its antimoney laundering activities. We have to recognise that/uni00A0the bank's efforts were unfortunately insufficient. Now,/uni00A0twenty percent of the workforce is devoted to getting files in order and making sure the bank fulfils its gatekeeper role. The bank made clear agreements with the supervisory authority and is doing everything in its power to live up to these agreements. Nonetheless, such a settlement with the public prosecutor is a very emotional and upsetting experience. It's/uni00A0been an important topic in the conversations between management and the Supervisory Board.\n\n1",

For now, the horizon is 2024. But the plans that were scheduled for 2021 were either completed or are being carried out now. Management fully succeeded in making 2021 the year of our licence to operate by resolving issues with the supervisory authorities and the public prosecutor. And while we are operating in a difficult environment due to/uni00A0Covid-19 and low interest rates, and there were several changes in senior management, ABN AMRO stayed up and/uni00A0running and focused on its clients. In that respect, we/uni00A0may be satisfied with 2021. I value the energy with which the bank's senior managers - and the entire bank are working hard to execute the strategy.\n\n## ABN AMRO introduced a new organisational structure in 2021 and incorporated the Executive Committee into the Executive Board. Why was that necessary?\n\nRobert Swaak and I both share the view that having an Executive Board and an Executive Committee is no longer necessary. Given the current size of the bank and in light of/uni00A0the strategy review of focusing on Northwest Europe, we no longer need this structure. So this change is a logical consequence of the strategy review. Having a single Executive Board will enable the bank to better serve its clients, and also keep senior management from creating silos of separate business lines, with their own CEOs and their own organisational structures. In addition, all senior executives will have the same statutory responsibility and,/uni00A0in line with the rest of the organisation, will operate more as a single unit.\n\n## How is the relationship between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board? What do you think of the current composition of and collaboration within the Supervisory Board? What about the balance of/uni00A0gender, cultural backgrounds and competences of/uni00A0the/uni00A0members?\n\nDespite all the changes that have taken place in the past two years, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board have worked together very well. But however you look at it, in all that time we've met in person only once or twice. That's bound to have an impact on teambuilding. Non-verbal communication is really important and it's easy to miss certain signals when you're meeting online. But under the/uni00A0circumstances, I must say that we have maintained an/uni00A0excellent relationship.\n\nWith respect to diversity, the Supervisory Board is now made up of three women and four men. As for cultural and/uni00A0geographical backgrounds, we have two supervisory directors from outside the Netherlands. I believe a company's top management structure should reflect the makeup of its clients, and of society. And since ABN AMRO's clients are very diverse, this should be mirrored in our leadership. We're always looking for ways to improve in/uni00A0this/uni00A0area.\n\n## Your name was mentioned in connection with the Pandora Papers, due to an investment you made in a friend's project that went through a tax paradise, the British Virgin Islands. How do you look back on this?\n\nThe day this was announced I wrote a letter to the bank's employees expressing my regret and I donated the entire investment sum, which I had considered a gift, to the founder of the project. At the time, I made the investment with sincere intentions. I certainly understand that currently the structure of the investment raises questions. I'd like to emphasise that I fully underscore ABN AMRO's position on discouraging the use of undesirable tax structures. And it's upsetting to me that the bank received negative publicity around this matter.",

The role of/uni00A0banks in environmental, social and governance (ESG) was extensively discussed, also addressing the development of/uni00A0uniform sustainability standards. ABN AMRO has clear targets when it comes to sustainability - it is also part of/uni00A0our assessment of the Executive Board - and as the/uni00A0Supervisory Board, it is our role to challenge senior management to implement the agreed policies and strategies. I believe the bank's role in the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy is very important.\n\n## ' ABN AMRO has clear\n\n## targets when it comes to sustainability -it/uni00A0is/uni00A0also part of our assessment of the Executive Board.'\n\n## What did the Supervisory Board do well in 2021, and what could be improved?\n\nThe things I've already mentioned - overseeing the execution of the strategy, collaborating with the Executive Board, fighting money laundering. What we could improve is that we could serve more as a sounding board for the/uni00A0Executive Board. That's why it's important for the supervisory directors to have a broad societal vision and very diverse backgrounds. Digitalisation and ESG are also subjects in which supervisors should be well versed in/uni00A0order to be a good sounding board. I am very committed to continuously developing in these important areas.\n\n## In conclusion, what do you see as the biggest challenges in 2022?\n\nThe Supervisory Board's biggest job is to closely monitor everything that has to be implemented between now and 2024. In addition, the sustainability portfolio is of huge importance to me. If you talk about sustainability, the market, our supervisors and society expect you to walk the/uni00A0talk, even in transitional periods. Businesses have to be/uni00A0very flexible in order to be able to live up to society's expectations relating to the sustainability transition. This/uni00A0subject is high on the Supervisory Board's agenda,\n\nas/uni00A0far/uni00A0as/uni00A0I'm concerned.\n\nI also believe it's very important for ABN AMRO to make good on its intention to focus on Northwest Europe. We're well represented in the Netherlands, but Northwest Europe is more than just the Netherlands - we also have operations in Germany, France and Belgium. How do we view ramping up our activities in these countries? And last but not least, we're still acting on all the agreements we made to fight money laundering. Here, too, the Supervisory Board needs to keep a close eye on things.\n\nAnd finally, ABN AMRO's employee engagement score is high, even despite Covid-19, but we'd like it to be higher. Raising this score is an important job for senior management, and the Supervisory Board will monitor this as well. On/uni00A0a/uni00A0related note, how do you recruit, retain and develop talented employees? We've hired people in the past two years who've never been inside the bank. What's their connection with the company that has given them their laptops and office chairs? The bank needs to devote a/uni00A0lot of/uni00A0attention to this. So there's plenty of work ahead!\n\n## Tom de Swaan\n\nSupervisory Board/uni00A0Chair of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.\n\n1",

In addition, the Supervisory Board and/uni00A0the Executive Committee jointly had three strategy meetings. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions the meetings were partly held online./uni00A0\n\nRegular Supervisory Board meetings take place following the meetings of the Remuneration Committee, Selection & Nomination Committee, Risk & Capital Committee and the/uni00A0Audit Committee. These committees report to the Supervisory Board on their deliberations and findings after/uni00A0their meeting, and the Supervisory Board takes into account their outcomes and recommendations. The Company Secretary (or deputy Company Secretary) attends all meetings and is the secretary to the Supervisory Board and its committees. The Executive Board attends the regular meetings of the Supervisory Board and prepares detailed supporting documents. The regular meetings take five hours on average. Other bank staff and the internal and external auditor are frequently invited to give presentations on specific topics such as performance highlights, the capital & funding plan, strategy, investor relations updates, the risk appetite, legal cases, quarterly audit reports and the quarterly report of the interaction with the supervisors ECB, DNB and AFM.\n\nIn addition to the regular meetings of the Supervisory Board additional meetings were held to discuss the investigation by the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service (NPPS) and/uni00A0to discuss the settlement dialogue with the NPPS. Further the Supervisory Board had additional meetings to/uni00A0discuss the Risk Management Foundation Plan. After several iterations the Supervisory Board approved the Risk/uni00A0Management Foundation Plan in its meeting on 28/uni00A0April 2021. Another important item that was discussed during the meetings of the Supervisory Board was the compensation framework as a response to the Kifid ruling in March 2021. On 2 September 2021 the Supervisory Board discussed the compensation framework regarding\n\nthe revolving consumer credit products with a variable interest rate. On 4 September 2021 the negotiations with the Consumentenbond were finalised and the Supervisory Board approved the agreed compensation framework.\n\nFollowing the strategy review the Supervisory Board had/uni00A0three joint meetings with the Executive Board and Executive Committee on the Future of Banking in order to/uni00A0explore the future value creation for ABN AMRO in the/uni00A0longer run. Among others macro-economic shifts, sustainability, EU regulation harmonisation and digital assets were discussed during these sessions.\n\nIn addition the meetings focused on specific subjects such as the Executive Committee's succession planning, particularly the succession of the CFO and the interim position of the CEO Commercial Banking. The new organisational structure including the new set up of the statutory Management Board were extensively debated./uni00A0 Other topics on the agenda were the financial plan for 2022-2026, the sale and leaseback of the Gustav Mahlerlaan 10, performance management, innovation and technology, the culture change plan and ancillary positions of Supervisory Board members and members of the Executive Committee. Anna Stor\u00e5kers and Tjalling Tiemstra were mandated by the Supervisory Board to discuss the Recovery Plan with Risk and the mandated members subsequently approved the Recovery Plan.\n\nDetails of the composition of the Supervisory Board throughout 2021 can be found in the Composition and diversity paragraph in the Supervisory Board section. The personal details of the members of the Supervisory Board are considered to be incorporated, by reference, in this Report of the Supervisory Board. On 14 November 2021 Jurgen Stegmann has decided for personal reasons to resign as a member of the Supervisory Board with immediate effect. Jurgen Stegmann contributed substantially to the work of the Supervisory Board in the past five years especially in/uni00A0the field of risk management as Chair of/uni00A0the Risk and Capital Committee.",

Regarding the regulatory environment, ABN AMRO continued to work on retaining trust and only making proper use of client data. On 25 September 2019, the NPPS informed ABN AMRO that the bank was the subject of an investigation relating to requirements under the Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism (Wwft). In the beginning of the year ABN AMRO started the settlement dialogue with the NPPS and in the meeting of 25 March 2021 the Supervisory Board validated the results of the settlement dialogue with the NPPS. In its meeting on 18 April 2021 the Supervisory Board accepted a settlement offer from the NPPS in connection with the investigation by the NPPS into ABN AMRO's AML activities in the Netherlands over the period 2014-2020. As part of this settlement it was agreed that ABN AMRO would pay EUR 480 million. The joint temporary committee established by the Supervisory Board and Executive Board, to coordinate, advise on and supervise the main activities following the investigation initiated by the NPPS was discontinued and terminated in June 2021./uni00A0The Supervisory Board continued to monitor the progress on the remediation plan.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was also regularly updated on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's key financial and non-financial risks and the design of the internal risk management and control systems. During these updates the Executive Board's assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and control systems was monitored and discussed. The Risk Management Foundation Plan was an important topic and the Supervisory Board approved the Risk Management Foundation Plan in its meeting on 28 April 2021. Each quarter the Supervisory Board receives a progress update on the execution of the Risk Management Foundation Plan. The bank's risk appetite and ICAAP/ILAAP were also discussed and approved. In addition, the Supervisory Board had in-depth discussions on material legal, credit, tax and compliance files. The DNB-ECB & AFM\n\nactivities report, ERM report and policy approval report were also discussed each quarter.\n\nFollowing the updated strategy as communicated in November 2020 the Supervisory Board received an update on the strategy execution each quarter. The outcome of the strategy review was translated into themes, which together shape the overall change portfolio of ABN/uni00A0AMRO in the coming years. For 2021 the overall focus has been defined as 'strengthening the foundation'. Therefore the primary focus was on key deliveries related to: Detecting Financial Crime, duty-of-care, credit model landscape, Risk & Finance reporting, Data foundation, and the managed wind-down of CIB non-core. While at the same time creating the foundation for delivering market leading customer value propositions for the ABN/uni00A0AMRO's target segments, by upgrading key digital and data capabilities, digitalising specific processes, and building out the NWE banking/uni00A0platform.\n\nFurther to the updated strategy the organisational and management structure were reviewed. The Supervisory Board discussed in February 2021 that a new set up of the organisational structure, including the business lines, is needed to support the change to successfully execute the updated strategy. The Supervisory Board discussed and approved the rationale for the proposed changes in the business line set-up and the envisaged organisational chart./uni00A0 Following the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 24/uni00A0November 2021, the Supervisory Board approved to abolish the Executive Committee and approved the new setup of the Executive Board including appointments of Gerard Penning as the Chief Human Resources Officer, Choy van der Hooft-Cheong as Chief Commercial Officer Wealth Management and Dan Dorner as the Chief Commercial Officer Corporate Banking. The Supervisory Board worked on the selection process for the Chief Commercial Officer Personal & Business Banking.\n\nPart of the execution of the strategy review was the intended sale and leaseback of the bank's head office at\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

Victory Group will pay EUR/uni00A0765/uni00A0million for the Gustav Mahler building, taking into account the favourable lease conditions for the coming years when ABN/uni00A0AMRO will lease back the entire building during the redevelopment of the Foppingadreef Offices.\n\nFrom 26 September until 29 September 2021 the annual joint study trip of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and the Executive committee took place in Frankfurt. Two topics had a prominent place on the agenda in Frankfurt: fintechs and sustainability. The role of banks in/uni00A0Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) was extensively discussed, also addressing the development of/uni00A0uniform sustainability standards. In addition, several fintechs operating in a variety of segments, from lending to payments, gave presentations on the pace of developments and what they are working on.\n\nThe Supervisory Board continued to actively engage with its key stakeholders in 2021, mainly by way of digital meetings but also physical meetings. The two members appointed pursuant to the enhanced recommendation right of the Employee Council, Laetitia Griffith and Arjen Dorland, met regularly with the Employee Council throughout the/uni00A0year to maintain an active dialogue and obtain the Employee Council's thoughts and input on various matters, including diversity, work satisfaction, the strategy execution and the new organisational structure. The Chair and other members of the Supervisory Board also met with the Employee Council on several formal and informal occasions during the year. The Supervisory Board appreciates the constructive relationship it has with the Employee Council, and highly values the input, engagement, suggestions and/uni00A0considerations provided by the Employee Council in the/uni00A0interests of the bank. Active engagement was also maintained throughout the year with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), the European Central Bank (ECB), the AFM,\n\nSTAK AAB and NLFI./uni00A0The Supervisory Board's aim continued to be to ensure that the bank is well positioned to create long-term value for its shareholders and for society, while focusing firmly on clients' interests and balancing the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nA description of the duties, responsibilities and current composition of the Supervisory Board, including its committees and other positions held by members of the Supervisory Board, is provided in the Supervisory Board section of this chapter. More information on remuneration is provided in the Remuneration report section of this chapter. These subjects are considered to be incorporated, by reference, in this Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Supervisory Board Committees\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee is tasked with the direct supervision of all subjects relating to financial reporting and controlling. In doing so, it is responsible for supervising and advising the complete Supervisory Board on, matters as (i) the assessment of the principles of valuation and determination of results for the financial statements, (ii) internal control and financial reporting functions, (iii) internal and external audit, (iv) risk assessment of issues that could impact the financial reporting, (v) regulatory compliance in relation to financial reporting, (vi) mediation between internal or external auditors and/or management where needed, and (vii) reporting to the Supervisory Board.\n\n/uni00A0As of 19 January 2021, the Audit Committee consisted of Tjalling Tiemstra (Chair), Michiel Lap, Jurgen Stegmann and Anna Stor\u00e5kers.

All regular plenary meetings of the/uni00A0Audit Committee were also attended by the CEO, the CFO (and CFO a.i.) and the CRO. The Director Group Audit, the/uni00A0Director Financial Accounting, the Director Corporate Controlling, the external auditor and the deputy Company Secretary also attended the full plenary meetings.\n\nIn March 2021 the Audit Committee took a decision, without holding a meeting, on evaluating the external auditor's performance for the purpose of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn addition to the plenary meetings, the Chair and other members of the Audit Committee regularly held separate meetings in 2021 with the Director Group Audit, the CFO, the CRO, the Director Financial Accounting and the Director Corporate Controlling, and others. The Chair of the Audit Committee met the external auditor bilaterally on several occasions in 2021, focusing on the progress of the/uni00A0external audit and other subjects relevant to the Committee's responsibilities. The Chair also met with the European Central Bank and the Dutch Central Bank on one occasion during the year. In addition, the Committee's members met managers of various departments so as to remain well informed on topics subject to the Committee's supervision. Directly after the first meeting in March 2021, at which the draft annual accounts were discussed, the Audit Committee met the external auditor bilaterally to seek confirmation that all relevant matters emerging from the audit had been brought to the Committee's attention. In addition, the level of cooperation between Ernst & Young Accountants LLP/uni00A0and management, the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and Group Audit was discussed.\n\nThe Audit Committee's discussions in the plenary meetings covered topics including the quarterly reports, the interim and annual accounts, the quarterly press releases, the 2020 Integrated Report and 2020 Annual Report of ABN AMRO and key audit matters reported by internal and external audit.

The lower loan volumes affected the gap to the TLTRO benchmark, which was touched upon on several occasions. The Audit Committee also monitored the effects of the measures taken by ABN AMRO to limit the negative impact of the pandemic on its clients. The Audit Committee continually paid attention to current and future operational results, also in view of the low interest rate environment.

The Committee also took note of financial reports issued to supervisory authorities, such as the COREP and FINREP reports. In addition, the Audit Committee considered the role, performance and reports from Group Audit, reports from the external auditor, management letters and the auditor's independence and fees. The Committee was also informed of, and discussed if needed, all relevant letters from the European Central Bank and the Dutch Central Bank. The Audit Committee closely monitored the financial and regulatory reporting improvement programmes in 2021 and was regularly updated on the progress of these programmes by the Executive Board, Group Audit and the external auditor.\n\nIn February 2021, in addition to the regular topics noted above, the Audit Committee advised the Supervisory Board to approve the annually updated auditor independence policy Moreover, the Committee received the 2020 overview of whistleblowing cases and exchanged views on/uni00A0the letter from the VEB to audit firms focusing on the contribution expected of auditors at annual general/uni00A0meetings.\n\nIn March 2021, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Integrated Report 2020, the Annual Report 2020, the related press release, the external auditor's report on the 2020 consolidated financial statements, the external auditor's report 2020 and the Management Control Statement. The Audit Committee requested management to revise the display of the remuneration tables in the Remuneration report of the Integrated Annual Report 2021.

The agenda for the Annual General Meeting must contain certain subjects specified in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Articles of Association and under Dutch law, for example the adoption of the annual financial statements. Shareholders or holders of depositary receipts who alone or jointly represent at least 3% of the issued share capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO are allowed to add items to the agenda of the General Meeting, provided they submit a request for this (including reasons) to ABN/uni00A0AMRO at least 60 days prior to the General Meeting.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Executive Board are both entitled to convene a General Meeting. Shareholders or holders of depositary receipts issued with the cooperation of ABN/uni00A0AMRO may also convene a General Meeting, provided they represent at least 10% of the issued share capital. NLFI may also request the Executive Board or Supervisory Board to convene a General Meeting, as stated in the Relationship Agreement.\n\nExtraordinary General Meetings may be convened if deemed necessary, for instance to resolve important decisions, such as major acquisitions and divestments or appointments of Executive Board or Supervisory Board members that cannot be deferred until the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO held two General Meetings in 2021: the Annual General Meeting on 21 April and an Extraordinary General Meeting on 24 November. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, both meetings were held fully virtually (in accordance with the temporary law regarding Covid-19), rather than allowing holders of shares and depositary receipts to attend in person. Shareholders and depositary receipt holders were able to ask questions about items on the agenda before and during each meeting.\n\nThe agenda of the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2021 included:\n\n- H the adoption of the 2020 annual financial statements;\n- H the remuneration report;\n- H the reservation/uni00A0and dividend policy;\n- H the report on the functioning of the external auditor and the reappointment of Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as external auditor for the financial years 2022 and 2023;\n- H the re-appointment of Tanja Cuppen (CRO) and Christian Bornfeld (CI&TO) as members of the Executive Board;\n- H the introduction of Lars Kramer as a proposed member of the Executive Board (CFO);\n\n- H the authorisation for the Executive Board to (a) issue shares and/or grant rights to subscribe for shares, (b) limit or exclude pre-emptive rights, and (c) acquire shares or depositary receipts for shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's own capital/uni00A0for a period of 18 months from the date of the General Meeting, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and provided the total number of shares or depositary receipts held by ABN/uni00A0AMRO is limited to 10% of the issued share capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO; and\n- H the cancellation of shares and depositary receipts for/uni00A0shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's own capital held by ABN/uni00A0AMRO, and the related reduction of the authorised capital (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, ordinary/uni00A0shares B).\n\nOn 19 April 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO announced that it had accepted a settlement offer from the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service relating to the previously announced AML investigation. Due to the short timeframe between the announcement of the settlement and the Annual General Meeting, this matter could not be taken into account by all shareholders and depositary receipt holders when voting at the Annual General Meeting as most of them had already issued their voting instructions ahead of the meeting. ABN/uni00A0AMRO therefore decided to withdraw the agenda item relating to the discharge of the Executive Board members and Supervisory Board members for 2020 at the Annual General Meeting of 2021.\n\nThe agenda of the Extraordinary General Meeting on 24/uni00A0November 2021 included:\n\n- H changes to the corporate governance structure;\n- H the introduction of Dan Dorner as a proposed member of the Executive Board (CCO Corporate Banking);\n- H the introduction of Choy van der Hooft-Cheong as a proposed member of the Executive Board (CCO Wealth Management);\n- H the introduction of Gerard Penning as a proposed member of the Executive Board (CHRO).\n\n## Shareholder structure\n\nAt 31 December 2021, all shares in the capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO were held by two foundations: Stichting Administratiekantoor beheer financiele instellingen (NLFI) and Stichting Administratiekantoor Continu\u00efteit ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank (STAK AAB). On that date, NLFI held 56.3% in the share capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO, of which 49.9% was directly held via ordinary shares and 6.4% was indirectly held via depositary receipts for shares in the capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. On that date, STAK AAB held 50.1% of the shares in the issued capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Only STAK AAB's depositary receipts have been issued with the cooperation of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and are traded on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## NLFI\n\nThe Dutch State holds an interest in ABN/uni00A0AMRO through NLFI. NLFI was set up to avoid potential conflicting responsibilities that the Dutch Minister of Finance might otherwise face and to avoid undesired political influence being exerted. NLFI holds 56.3% in ABN/uni00A0AMRO, of which 49.9% is directly held via ordinary shares and 6.4% is indirectly held via depositary receipts for shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO issued by STAK AAB. NLFI is responsible for managing these shares and depositary receipts and for exercising all rights associated with these shares under Dutch law, including voting rights.\n\nNLFI acts as a stand-alone shareholder that is independent of the Dutch State, including the Dutch Ministry of Finance. However, important decisions taken by NLFI require prior approval by the Dutch Minister of Finance, who can also give binding voting instructions to NLFI with respect to such decisions. NLFI is not permitted to dispose of or encumber the ordinary shares in the capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO without the authorisation of the Dutch Minister of Finance.\n\nNLFI entered into a Relationship Agreement with ABN/uni00A0AMRO governing their relationship after the initial public offering (IPO). The full text of the Relationship Agreement is available on abnamro.com. The Relationship Agreement will terminate if and when NLFI (directly or indirectly) holds less than 10% of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's issued share capital. A limited number of clauses will not terminate under any circumstances.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement includes the following provisions, subject to certain conditions stated in the agreement:\n\n- H NLFI's right to be consulted by (a) the Supervisory Board on the appointment or reappointment of (i) members of/uni00A0the Executive Board and (ii) the Chair of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board, and (b) the Executive Board on a proposal for the appointment of the external/uni00A0auditor;\n- H NLFI's right of prior approval of any issuance of (or granting of rights to acquire) shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO for/uni00A0as/uni00A0long as NLFI holds at least 33 1/3% of the shares/uni00A0in ABN/uni00A0AMRO;\n- H NLFI's right of prior approval of (a) for as long as NLFI holds more than 50% of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO: any investments or divestments by ABN/uni00A0AMRO or any of its subsidiaries with a value of more than 5% of the equity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and (b) for as long as NLFI holds 50% or/uni00A0less but 33 1/3% or more of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO: any investment or divestments by ABN/uni00A0AMRO or any of its subsidiaries with a value of/uni00A0more than 10% of the/uni00A0equity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO;\n- H NLFI's obligation to effect sell-downs of ABN/uni00A0AMRO shares through STAK AAB;\n- H certain orderly market arrangements; and\n- H certain information rights for NLFI as long as it holds at least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\n## STAK AAB\n\nSTAK AAB is a trust office independent of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the holder of a majority of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's issued share capital. STAK AAB acquired such shares for the purpose of administration ( ten titel van beheer ) in exchange for depositary receipts. The manner in which this structure can serve as a defence measure and STAK AAB's role in this is set out in this section under Anti-takeover measures.\n\nIn addition to serving as a defence measure, STAK AAB aims to promote the exchange of information between ABN/uni00A0AMRO on the one hand and holders of depositary receipts and shareholders on the other hand. It also promotes the acquisition of voting instructions from depositary receipt holders, for example by organising a meeting of depositary receipt holders prior to ABN/uni00A0AMRO's General Meetings. STAK AAB reports on its activities at least once a year in its annual report. In addition, further sell-downs of NLFI's shareholding in ABN/uni00A0AMRO will take place through STAK AAB (and in the form of depositary receipts) only.\n\nBy virtue of its trust conditions, STAK AAB must ensure that, no later than two weeks before a General Meeting of ABN/uni00A0AMRO is held, a meeting of depositary receipt holders is held at which the agenda items of that General Meeting are discussed. Accordingly, STAK AAB held meetings of depositary receipt holders before the Annual and Extraordinary General Meetings of ABN/uni00A0AMRO on 6 April 2021 and 9 November 2021 respectively.\n\nThe STAK AAB website (stakaab.org) provides more information on the activities of STAK AAB, STAK AAB's objectives, as well as its annual report, articles of association, trust conditions and any information relating to/uni00A0meetings of depositary receipt holders.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO and STAK AAB held two periodic meetings in 2021. The items discussed included the published financial results, the long-term strategy of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the intended governance in the event of hostile bids and shareholder activism.\n\n## Anti-takeover measures\n\nThe Netherlands has traditionally embraced the use of defence measures to ensure long-term value creation for stakeholders. In large part, these measures involve the use of a Dutch foundation ( stichting ) that is granted special rights intended to prevent an unsolicited takeover or other hostile activity. This also applies to ABN/uni00A0AMRO. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has implemented a structure whereby the Dutch foundation",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n( stichting ) STAK AAB is holder of shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's issued share capital and has issued depositary receipts representing such shares with the cooperation of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. The purpose of having a structure under which depositary receipts are created and STAK AAB is the legal owner of the underlying shares is to create a defence measure and ensure long-term value creation for stakeholders.\n\nSTAK AAB will do everything in its power to deter any action that could affect the independence, continuity or identity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. In a non-hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of depositary receipt holders. In a hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business enterprises. Under all circumstances, STAK AAB will also take into account the legitimate interests of all other stakeholders: clients, debt investors, shareholders, depositary receipt holders, employees, and the society in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates.\n\nIn a non-hostile situation, STAK AAB will grant a power of attorney to the depositary receipt holders to exercise the voting rights attached to the underlying shares. STAK AAB will not exercise voting rights on the shares, unless holders of depositary receipts have requested it to do so. This may be different under hostile circumstances as described in Section 2:118a of the Dutch Civil Code. In this case, STAK AAB may refuse or revoke powers of attorney for up to two years (whereby NLFI must pre-approve this decision by STAK AAB as long as NLFI holds at least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO) and STAK AAB itself will exercise the voting rights. In doing so, it should, pursuant to the trust conditions and the articles of association of STAK AAB, focus primarily on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's interests, taking into account the legitimate interests of the stakeholders mentioned above.\n\n## Employee Council\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's employees are represented by works councils ( ondernemingsraden ) at all levels of its group in which specifically appointed delegates are centralised in the overarching Employee Council ( Raad van Medewerkers ). Under Dutch law, the managing board of any company running an enterprise in which a works council has been established must seek the non-binding advice of the works council before taking certain decisions with respect to the enterprise, such as those related to a major restructuring, a change of control, or the appointment or dismissal of a member of the managing board. Certain other decisions directly involving employment matters that apply either to all employees or certain groups of employees may only be taken with the works council's consent.\n\nThe Employee Council deals primarily with topics that affect all parts of the group's organisation and meets regularly with members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board on various other occasions throughout the year, including an annual joint meeting of the Executive Committee, the Supervisory Board and the Employee Council. The Employee Council and ABN/uni00A0AMRO have entered into an agreement under which the Employee Council has been granted certain additional rights (the Works Council Covenant). Under the Works Council Covenant, the Employee Council has the right of inquiry ( enqu\u00eaterecht ) within the meaning of Section 2:346 of the Dutch Civil Code in the event of a hostile situation. The Works Council Covenant defines the following situations as hostile: (i) a public offer has been announced or is made in respect of shares in the capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO (or in respect of depositary receipts representing such shares) or there is a justified expectation that this will take place, without agreement first having been reached between the bidder and ABN/uni00A0AMRO, (ii) the exercise of the voting rights by a depositary receipt holder or shareholder would effectively be in conflict with the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business, or (iii) any other situation in which the independence, continuity or identity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the enterprises associated with ABN/uni00A0AMRO could be harmed. Other situations can be qualified as hostile in an agreement between the Employee Council and ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Furthermore, if NLFI requests the consent, cooperation and/or a position statement of ABN/uni00A0AMRO in the event of a subsequent placement or a private sale of shares or depositary receipts, ABN/uni00A0AMRO will request advice from the Employee Council within the meaning of Articles 25 and 26 of the Works Councils Act ( Wet op de ondernemingsraden ).\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

In this letter, I would like to reflect briefly on some key topics and considerations for the Remuneration Committee in the past year.\n\n/uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, we made progress in executing our strategy to be a personal bank in the digital age, serving clients where we have scale in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe. ABN/uni00A0AMRO aims to pursue a responsible remuneration policy within the regulatory boundaries and considering the interests of our stakeholders. As a value-driven organisation, our decisions and behaviour need to be in line with our purpose and strategy. Our remuneration policy should enable us to attract and retain the right talent and ensure that we meet our responsibilities to clients and other stakeholders, both now and in the future. We need well-trained, engaged and entrepreneurial employees with the right expertise, as well as flawless processes and technologies. We need to enable our employees to develop new skills by investing in employee development. We also need to be able to continue to create value for our stakeholders and society at large. We strive to embed new remuneration regulations effectively and efficiently in our reward policies and principles./uni00A0\n\n## Strategy execution\n\nAs part of the simplification of our organisational structure, and to better serve our clients, the Executive Committee was changed into an extended Executive Board. We welcomed Choy van der Hooft-Cheong (CCO Wealth Management), Dan Dorner (CCO Corporate Banking) and Gerard Penning (Chief Human Resources Officer) as members of the Executive Board from 24 November 2021. We also announced Annerie Vreugdenhil as a candidate for/uni00A0the position of CCO Personal & Business Banking, for which regulatory approval has been obtained. The Executive Committee ceased to exist from the same date. The former Executive Committee members Daphne de Kluis and Rutger van Nouhuijs resigned in 2021, and the employment contracts of Pieter van Mierlo and Frans van der Horst are due to end during 2022. In early 2022, Christian Bornfeld resigned as at 1 May 2022. In Q4 2021, as part of the implementation of the new structure, a reorganisation was/uni00A0conducted at the level of the Extended Leadership Team (i.e. all direct reports to the Executive Board with managerial responsibility). All members of the Extended Leadership Team were appointed with effect from 1/uni00A0January 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive Board Remuneration Policy\n\nIn 2022, with the new Executive Board members and the Extended Leadership Team having been installed, the focus will continue to be on strategy execution, also in the organisational layers below the Extended Leadership Team. In 2022, we will initiate internal and external stakeholder engagements on a proposal for adjusting our Executive Board Remuneration Policy, and more specifically the performance KPIs for Executive Board members, in order to/uni00A0achieve more alignment with our strategy and expected legislation.\n\n## Negotiations of Collective Labour Agreement ('CLA')\n\nIn the Netherlands, our Collective Labour Agreements (comprising the CLA employment conditions and the Social Plan) are applicable to the vast majority of the employees. The CLA employment conditions and the Social Plan both reached the end of their term on 1 January 2022. Following extensive negotiations with the unions, agreement was reached on CLA employment conditions for the period from 1 January 2022 to 1 July 2022, with a specific focus on arrangements for hybrid working, wellbeing and employability. The transportation arrangements were also updated to take into account hybrid working and our sustainability strategy. The Social Plan, which is a separate CLA, has been extended for a period of three years/uni00A0\n\n## Settlement agreed with the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service (NPPS) April 2021\n\nOn 19 April 2021, it was announced that ABN AMRO had accepted a settlement offer from the NPPS relating to the previously announced investigation into the bank's AML activities in the Netherlands over the period 2014-2020. As/uni00A0part of this settlement, we paid a fine of EUR 300 million and EUR 180 million as a disgorgement. ABN AMRO deeply regrets the situation and recognises the seriousness of the/uni00A0matter, in which we fell short in fulfilling our role as/uni00A0a/uni00A0gatekeeper seeking to combat money laundering. The/uni00A0settlement was taken into account when deciding on the award of variable remuneration for 2021, as described in/uni00A0the report below./uni00A0\n\n## Diversity & equal pay\n\nWe aim to provide a working environment where everyone can be themselves and feel safe, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. In 2021, we were given the first ever Diamond Award for cultural diversity by the 'Talent to the Top Foundation'. This award recognises our broad-ranging efforts to promote diversity, including our programmes that support employees with different cultural backgrounds and offer jobs to refugees with residence permits. In 2022 we will introduce a pilot in which employees can swap two public holidays for two days off that are of significance to their religious or philosophical beliefs./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n1",

During the past few years, ABN AMRO has achieved good results on equal pay within the CLA population in the Netherlands. In 2021, preparations were made to adjust the remuneration methodology for the Dutch CLA+ employees (i.e. employees appointed at a job/uni00A0level that exceeds the CLA job levels) and to improve arrangements ensuring equal pay for equal work or work of/uni00A0equal value. These changes were implemented with effect from 1 January 2022.\n\nAside from paying equally for equal work or work of equal value, good progress has been achieved on diversity in appointments within our Dutch CLA+ population. The gender diversity of the Extended Leadership Team increased from 44% to 47% female employees as at 1 January 2022 as a result of the reorganisation at the level of the Extended Leadership Team. The Executive Board consisted of 33.33% female members until 24 November 2021. From that date, the Executive Board consisted of 28% female members and will increase to 37.5% female members upon appointment of Annerie Vreugdenhil. For most of 2021, the Supervisory Board consisted of 43% female members. The current composition of the Supervisory Board complies with the Act on Gender Balance in Management and Supervisory Boards (Wet\n\nEvenwichtiger verhouding tussen mannen en vrouwen in/uni00A0bestuur en raden van commissarissen) , which came into/uni00A0force on 1 January 2022./uni00A0\n\nAs Covid-19 continues to affect the way we live and work,\n\nI/uni00A0would like to thank our staff for their ceaseless dedication to our clients. I am pleased to report that our employee engagement remains high at 82%. This was after another challenging year, in which our employees were once again challenged to combine their work and private lives. I/uni00A0appreciate how challenging it can be to keep doing your job well in these circumstances. Although we continuously strive to support our colleagues in these difficult circumstances, we also realise that this period has demanded a lot from our employees.

Since 2015, additional limitations with respect to remuneration and particularly variable remuneration have applied to the Dutch financial sector, impacting all staff of ABN/uni00A0AMRO, with even more restrictions applying to financial institutions of which shares are held by the Dutch State. In alignment with the Act on the Remuneration Policy for Financial Undertakings (Wbfo), the variable compensation is capped at (an average of) 20% of base salary for those employed in the Netherlands./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe maximum variable compensation percentage for employees working outside the Netherlands in another European Economic Area ('EEA') state is 100%; for employees working outside the EEA, more than 100% is allowed, with a maximum of 200% and subject to shareholder approval. As ABN/uni00A0AMRO has not requested shareholder approval to increase the maximum variable compensation percentage to 200%, a cap of 100% applies outside the Netherlands./uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Bonus prohibition\n\nAs long as the Dutch State holds any interest in ABN/uni00A0AMRO, ABN/uni00A0AMRO is required to apply the bonus prohibition to a specific group of senior employees, as defined in the Wbfo. Senior employees in scope of the bonus prohibition are not allowed to be granted any variable remuneration or individual salary increases until the Dutch State no longer holds an interest in ABN/uni00A0AMRO ('Bonus Prohibition').\n\n## Remuneration details of Identified Staff\n\nStaff whose professional activities could have a material impact on the bank's risk profile are defined as Identified Staff. Within ABN/uni00A0AMRO, the group of Identified Staff consists of:\n\n- H Members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board;\n- H Members of the Executive Committee, not being a member of the Executive Board (until 24 November 2021);/uni00A0\n- H Members who hold a position at CLA+ level (including staff responsible for independent control functions);/uni00A0\n- H Other risk takers. The definition of the group of other risk takers follows from their impact on the economic capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO (EC threshold), membership of certain risk committees, having credit authority above a certain threshold or fulfilling specific roles;/uni00A0\n- H Other employees whose total remuneration exceeds specific thresholds./uni00A0\n\nAll variable remuneration awards for Identified Staff are subject to and structured in accordance with the applicable Variable Compensation Plan./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nBefore any variable remuneration is granted to Identified Staff, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies an ex-ante risk assessment consisting of collective quantitative risk adjustment mechanisms (such as the solvency check) and a qualitative individual check (the gatekeeper). The gatekeeper procedure is part of the performance management framework and provides for an assessment of each individual Identified Staff member by the control functions (Risk, Compliance and Audit) on the basis of several behavioural elements. This assessment results in an advice to the Executive Board, which ultimately decides on whether variable compensation can indeed be granted to the Identified Staff member concerned. The Executive Board's decision must be formally approved by the Supervisory Board, based on the advice of the Remuneration Committee./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe variable remuneration is awarded over time and split between an up-front portion (60%) and a deferred portion (40%), with all portions divided equally between a cash and a non-cash instrument. Up-front variable remuneration is awarded in the first quarter of the year following the relevant performance year, while deferred variable remuneration vests in equal instalments in the years following the first payment. This remuneration vests only after an explicit ex-post risk assessment: the 'malus assessment'. This assessment is performed by the Control functions and also results in an advice to the Executive Board, which decides whether a malus is applicable. The Executive Board's decision must be formally approved by the Supervisory Board, based on the advice of the Remuneration Committee./uni00A0\n\n## Equal pay\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO aims to create an environment where staff can express their identity and where equal work or work of equal value is rewarded equally. Through its diversity and inclusion policy, ABN/uni00A0AMRO aims to be an organisation where people feel safe and welcome. Rewarding equal work equally is of fundamental importance and has ABN/uni00A0AMRO's full attention./uni00A0\n\nInternal research shows that, for several years in a row, and within the CLA population in the Netherlands, men and women in the same salary scale have - on average - been paid equally and have had the same opportunities for promotion. In the case of the CLA+ positions, however, salary differences between men and women have been identified. In 2021, therefore, a new equal pay methodology was prepared, and then implemented with effect from 1 January 2022. As preparation for this new methodology, the job grades in the CLA+ positions have been (or will shortly be) regraded and the midpoints of the salary scales have been benchmarked against the market. Going forward, discretionary salary increases are being replaced by pre-set salary increases linked to the position in the salary scale in",

We are striving to make our staff's work more meaningful, while at the same time ensuring their duties are aligned with all the bank's current and future priorities. Our performance management aims to support our employees' ambitions, to build expertise and knowledge and to seek alignment with our goals (including reskilling and upskilling), thus creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. We aim to use Performance Management as a driving force for a culture of performance and accountability, characterised by clear expectations, single-point accountability, honest and courageous dialogues and recognition for outstanding performance./uni00A0\n\nOur performance management aims to create a clear link between performance (realistic, sustainable results) and reward in such a way that reward is aligned with both the employee's and the bank's performance. KPIs used are financial and non-financial, as well as qualitative and quantitative./uni00A0\n\n## Identified Staff/uni00A0\n\nFor Identified Staff (CLA and CLA+) a specific KPI framework applies, linked to the strategy of ABN AMRO and approved by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. For 2021, the group non-financial KPIs consisted of sustainability assets, while the group financial KPI was the CET1 ratio. The business line non-financial KPIs were gender diversity in the sub-top, net growth in strategic segments and rNPS, while the business line financial KPIs were cost level and segment ROE. At an individual level, objectives were set for results, behaviour and development. In the final performance scores, conveying the desired compliance and risk culture is taken into account at a business line and individual level./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Executive Board\n\nThe annual KPI framework is approved by the Supervisory Board. The performance criteria for Executive Board members are based on financial and non-financial measures at an organisation, business line and individual level, as/uni00A0set/uni00A0out in the Executive Board Remuneration Policy. The/uni00A0performance criteria and targets set reflect and contribute to key elements of the strategy of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and long-term value creation, especially Sustainability and House in Order. Annual targets are set for all KPIs. The/uni00A0performance of Executive Board members against\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthese KPIs is continually monitored by the Supervisory Board.

To mitigate the risk of staff leaving, and to ensure a compliant, controlled and client-focused winddown, retention packages were awarded in 2020 to nonEuropean CIB employees. The first payment of these retention awards was included in the remuneration report of 2020. The second payment of the retention awards, if applicable, was made in 2021 and is included in the remuneration report for the year./uni00A0\n\n## Settlement agreed with the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service April 2021/uni00A0\n\nOn 19 April 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO published details of its settlement with the NPPS. The fine and disgorgement pertaining to this settlement were explicitly considered when the award of variable remuneration for 2021 was being determined.\n\n## Relevant regulatory developments\n\nThe EBA Guidelines on Sound Remuneration Policies, applying from 31 December 2021, were published on 2 July 2021. The revised guidelines require institutions, inter alia, to apply sound and gender-neutral remuneration policies to/uni00A0all staff and to incorporate changes introduced by CRD/uni00A0V (which entered into force on 28 December 2020).\n\nOn 21 April 2021, the European Commission also published its Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/637. This requires institutions, from 28 June 2021, to disclose the information regarding their remuneration policy and practices required by Article 450 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (i.e. Pillar 3 disclosure)./uni00A0\n\nOn 19 October 2021, the Restrained Remuneration Policy Decree (Financial Supervision Act) 2021 (Regeling beheerst beloningsbeleid Wft 2021) replaced the Restrained Remuneration Policy Decree (Financial Supervision Act) 2017 (Regeling beheerst beloningsbeleid Wft 2017) .

These standards set out the criteria for defining managerial responsibility, control functions, material business units and a significant impact on a material business unit's risk profile, and set out criteria for identifying staff members or categories of staff whose professional activities have an impact on the institution's risk profile that is comparably as material as that of staff members or categories of staff referred to in Article 92(3) of that Directive./uni00A0\n\nIn the ex ante risk assessment in 2021, the impact of the award of variable remuneration on the total capital position of ABN AMRO was taken into account, as requested by the/uni00A0ECB in its letter dated 15 December 2020./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) came into force on 10 March 2021. This focuses on the need for the remuneration policy applicable to staff, especially those involved in ABN AMRO's investment products and services, to be consistent with the integration of sustainability risks. ABN AMRO is currently implementing this by taking a sustainability KPI into account when awarding variable remuneration./uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Forecast 2022\n\n## Legislation expected in/uni00A02022\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) issues remain highly important for credit institutions.

Some of those requirements entered into force in 2020 and during 2021, while others apply from 2022 onwards or even later. Proposals on new legislation in the Netherlands are also pending, but it is still unclear whether and when any amendments will take effect (Nadere beloningsregels financi\u00eble sector)./uni00A0\n\nOn 21 January 2022, the EBA launched two consultations for updating (i) its Guidelines on the remuneration benchmarking exercise, and (ii) its Guidelines for collecting data on high earners./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe above list of legislation and regulations is a nonexhaustive summary.

For ABN AMRO employees in the Netherlands, the gender pay gap corrected per salary scale amounts to 0.27% in favour of men. The overall gender pay gap (uncorrected per salary scale) in 2021 amounted to 14.7%. The overall gender pay gap is mainly caused by more men than women holding positions in the higher job grades. ABN AMRO will continue focusing on increasing gender diversity in the higher job levels so as to reduce the overall gender pay gap. The increased diversity in the appointments at ELT level is an example of this. /uni00A0\n\n## Remuneration details of Identified Staff\n\nVariable remuneration awarded to Identified Staff is awarded in line with the terms and conditions of the Variable Compensation Plan, which imposes restrictions on variable remuneration. The variable remuneration is split into an upfront award of 60% and a deferred award of 40%. Deferred variable remuneration in the current Variable Remuneration Plan (applicable from December 2020) vests in equal instalments in the four years after the first payment. The instrument underlying the non-cash award consists of performance certificates. The value of the performance certificates depends on the share price of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and hence fluctuates in line with the market. The value of the performance certificates will be paid out in cash. A one-year retention period applies to the non-cash award./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nVariable remuneration awards related to the performance years 2016 to November 2020 (inclusive) vest in equal instalments in the three years after the first payment. The instrument underlying the non-cash award consists of Depositary Receipts (DRs). The value of the DRs depends on the development of the share price of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and can be paid out in cash or by releasing the original number of DRs to the employee. A two-year retention period applies to the non-cash award. Variable remuneration awards with respect to the performance years up to and including 2015 consisted of performance certificates as a non-cash instrument. The value of these performance certificates fluctuated in line with the net asset value of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. The final deferred pay-out of the value of performance certificates was made in March 2021./uni00A0\n\n## Malus assessment in 2021\n\nThe malus assessment is conducted by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board upon analysis and advice of the control functions Risk, Compliance and Audit, and also based on input from all other relevant ABN/uni00A0AMRO departments, including HR and Finance. The malus assessment includes determining whether any new information is available that prevents the vesting of deferred variable remuneration, such as:/uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- H evidence of misconduct or serious error by the staff member (e.g. breach of a code of conduct or other internal rules, especially concerning risks);/uni00A0\n- H a significant downturn in the financial performance of the institution or business unit (based on specific indicators);\n- H a significant failure of risk management in the institution or business unit in which the Identified Staff member works;/uni00A0/uni00A0\n- H significant changes in the institution's economic or regulatory capital base./uni00A0\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board has the discretionary power to reduce any variable remuneration to a suitable amount if, in its opinion, payment of such remuneration would be unacceptable under the principle of reasonableness and fairness. The Supervisory Board is also authorised to reclaim any variable remuneration for any performance period if the award, calculation or payment was based on incorrect data or if, in hindsight, the performance conditions were not achieved. The recipient will then be required to repay the relevant amount to the bank. Lastly, personal hedging or insurance linked to remuneration and liability and designed to circumvent the effects of the risk controls that have been embedded in the/uni00A0bank's Variable Compensation Plan is not permitted./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nFor the performance period 2021, the Supervisory Board decided that, based on the reassessment performed by the control functions, there was no reason to apply a collective malus with respect to the vesting of:/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n- H The first tranche of deferred variable compensation for the 2020 performance period;/uni00A0/uni00A0\n- H The second tranche of deferred variable compensation for the 2019 performance period;/uni00A0/uni00A0\n- H The third tranche of deferred variable compensation for the 2018 performance period./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nFor performance period 2021, the Supervisory Board decided in three individual cases to apply a malus with respect to the vesting of any remaining deferred variable compensation for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 performance periods. As the staff members have left the bank and any entitlements to receive deferred variable remuneration have/uni00A0been forfeited, the malus has no further financial consequences.\n\nThe other deferred variable compensation awards with respect to the above three performance periods will be granted to the relevant Identified Staff members in line with the terms and conditions of the Variable Compensation Plan./uni00A0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

As ABN AMRO's financial results in 2021 improved significantly in comparison to its financial results in 2020, the overall award of performance-related variable remuneration increased. This increase was subsequently corrected for the settlement agreed with the NPPS. As the settlement was specifically related to our activities in the Netherlands, it was decided to apply a reduction of 25% to the award of variable remuneration for CLA+ employees on\n\na Dutch employment contract and to the bonus pool for eligible employees in the Netherlands. As a result, the performance-related variable remuneration of all staff, including Identified Staff, increased from EUR 16 million in/uni00A02020 to EUR 45 million in 2021./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nTotal retention payments increased from EUR/uni00A014/uni00A0million in 2020 to EUR/uni00A033/uni00A0million in 2021, mainly due to the retention payments made in respect of the wind-down of certain non-European CIB activities./uni00A0\n\n## 2021 Performance indicators for Identified Staff\n\n|                               | Weighting   Executive Board 5   | Weighting   Executive Committee   | Weighting above  CLA identified staff   | Weighting CLA  identified staff   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Organisation level KPIs       | 30-65%                          | 30-45%                            | 10-20%                                  | 10-15%                            |\n| Businessline level KPIs       | 0-35%                           | 20-40%                            | 35-50%                                  | 25-30%                            |\n| Individual KPI 1              | 35%                             | 30-35%                            | 40-45%                                  | 60%                               |\n| Total                         | 100%                            | 100%                              | 100%                                    | 100%                              |\n| - of which financial 2, 4     | 20-30%                          | 20-30%                            | 15-30%                                  | 12-23%                            |\n| - of which non-financial 3, 4 | 70-80%                          | 70-80%                            | 70-85%                                  | 77-88%                            |\n\n- 1 Individual KPI: For employees above CLA, the individual KPI refers to the score on individually determined KPIs.\n- 2 Financial KPIs include a selection of Return on Equity, CET1 ratio, Cost/income ratio, Cost ceiling, Cost level and Segment ROE.\n- 3 Non-financial KPIs include a selection of Sustainability DJSI, Employee engagement, House in Order, NPS, Sustainability assets, Gender diversity sub-top and Net growth in strategic segments.\n- 4 The mix and weighting of KPIs are tailored to specific function of the identified staff member.\n- 5 The CEO only has KPIs on an individual and organisation level.\n\n## Executive Board/uni00A0\n\n## Executive Board Remuneration Policy/uni00A0\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for the execution of the Executive Board Remuneration Policy.

They show the/uni00A0possible outcomes of the variable remuneration components and the way in which these affect the remuneration of the Executive Board members.

        "page_content": "As a matter of principle, the total target remuneration of the Executive Board members is below the median in the relevant benchmarking population. It was decided to continue of the previous remuneration policy with only some refinements to safeguard alignment with the new Shareholders Rights Directive. Moreover, considering that no variable remuneration is awarded and the remuneration restrictions that apply to ABN/uni00A0AMRO, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that scenario analyses have resulted in the appropriate levels of remuneration and that further scenario analyses are less relevant./uni00A0\n\n## Contractual elements\n\nAll members of the Executive Board have a services agreement (overeenkomst van opdracht) with ABN/uni00A0AMRO for an unlimited period of time which constitutes the contractual relationship between ABN AMRO and the Executive Board member. The Executive Board member may terminate the agreement subject to a notice period of three months, whereas ABN AMRO must observe a notice period of six months./uni00A0\n\n## Fixed remuneration/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO strives to position the overall level of direct compensation for Executive Committee members and positions at above-CLA level around the market median levels. In line with the Executive Board Remuneration policy, a 1.4% increase, following the CLA for the banking sector, was applied to the fixed remuneration with effect from 1 July 2021./uni00A0\n\nFrom 1 January 2021 until 1 July 2021:\n\n- H Membership of the Executive Board: EUR/uni00A0645,163 (EUR/uni00A0759,978 for the CEO)/uni00A0\n\nFrom 1 July 2021 until 1 January 2022:/uni00A0\n\n- H Membership of the Executive Board: EUR/uni00A0654,195 (EUR/uni00A0770,618 for the CEO)/uni00A0\n\n## Variable remuneration/uni00A0\n\nAs long as the Dutch State holds shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO, the/uni00A0Executive Board members are not entitled to variable remuneration. As this continued to be the case in the 2021 performance year, the Executive Board did not receive any variable remuneration./uni00A0\n\n## Benefits/uni00A0\n\nThe Chair and members of the Executive Board participate in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's pension schemes applicable to all employees in the Netherlands. For pensionable salary up to the applicable threshold, which for 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A0112,189, a collective defined contribution (CDC) pension scheme applies. The pension contribution is 37%, of which 5.5% is an employee contribution. In the event of/uni00A0death or when the Executive Board member becomes eligible for the state old-age pension (AOW), the services agreement automatically terminates by operation of law. The intended pension accrual is 1.875%, based on a pension age of 68. In 2021, the pension accrual was 1.76%. For pensionable salary in excess of EUR/uni00A0112,189, employees receive an allowance that can be used to build up a net pension in a group defined contribution (DC) plan. The allowance amounted to 30% in 2021. In addition to pension benefits, Executive Board members are eligible for benefits such as a company car and a chauffeur./uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Severance/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe remuneration policy for Executive Board members provides for a severance payment up to a maximum of one/uni00A0year's gross salary if their contract is terminated at/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO's initiative. The current Executive Board members all have the same contractual right to a severance payment equal to three months' gross fixed salary. No/uni00A0severance was paid to Executive Board members in 2021.",

This section explains how ABN/uni00A0AMRO complies with these codes and regulations. More comprehensive overviews of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's compliance with such codes and regulations are published under the Governance Codes and regulations section on/uni00A0abnamro.com.\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nWe believe that when corporate governance meets high international standards, it significantly boosts the confidence of a company's stakeholders. Since depositary receipts for shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO are listed on Euronext Amsterdam, ABN/uni00A0AMRO adheres to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## General compliance and explanations\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO complies with all principles and best practices of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, except for the deviations and nuances described below.\n\nUnder the Dutch Corporate Governance section on its website, ABN/uni00A0AMRO also publishes a detailed comply or/uni00A0explain list with regard to the adherence to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\nBest practice provision 1.3.6 (Absence of an internal audit department) does not apply since there is a separate department for the internal audit function within ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies best practice provision 2.1.9 (Independence of the Chair of the Supervisory Board), which states that the Chair of the Supervisory Board should not be a former member of the management board of the company. Although Mr Tom de Swaan was a member of the management board of the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO, the current ABN/uni00A0AMRO is the result of various legal and operational separations and combinations, a merger and a legal demerger that took place after the acquisition of the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Holding N.V. (the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group) by/uni00A0a consortium of banks in/uni00A0October/uni00A02007. The/uni00A0consortium consisted of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Fortis and Banco Santander S.A (the Consortium). In/uni00A0October/uni00A02008, when the Fortis group experienced financial difficulties, the Dutch State acquired certain operations of the Fortis group, as well as Fortis' interest in the vehicle that had acquired the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO group. ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group N.V. (ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group) was newly incorporated on 18/uni00A0December/uni00A02009 to hold the operations, assets and liabilities of parts of the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO group and the part of the Fortis group acquired by the Dutch State. On 6\n\nFebruary 2010, the new and current ABN/uni00A0AMRO demerged from the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. into a newly incorporated entity. The former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. was/uni00A0subsequently renamed Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. On/uni00A01/uni00A0July/uni00A02010, the new ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank and Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. merged pursuant to a legal merger, following which the current ABN/uni00A0AMRO was the surviving entity and Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. was the disappearing entity. ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group was merged into ABN/uni00A0AMRO on 29/uni00A0June/uni00A02019. The former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group and ABN/uni00A0AMRO are different entities than the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Holding N.V. or former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies best practice provision 4.1.3 (Agenda), which states, among other things, that (a) each substantial change in the corporate governance structure of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and in the compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and (b)/uni00A0material changes in the Articles of Association should be presented to the General Meeting as a separate discussion item or voting item, as applicable. The only exception to this/uni00A0best practice provision is that the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board may decide to/uni00A0place certain topics on the agenda under one agenda item if these topics are justifiably related. ABN/uni00A0AMRO considers this to be a further/uni00A0substantiation of this best practice provision, which may be/uni00A0necessary when proposals to amend the Articles of/uni00A0Association or the corporate governance structure of ABN/uni00A0AMRO are interrelated in such/uni00A0a way that separate votes on each of these proposals could result in an imbalanced voting result and, in turn, an/uni00A0imbalance in the/uni00A0corporate governance structure.\n\nBest practice provision 4.3.3 (Cancelling the binding nature/uni00A0of a nomination or dismissal) is not applicable to/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO since it applies the rules applicable to/uni00A0a/uni00A0large/uni00A0company regime ( structuurregime ).\n\nBest practice provision 4.3.4 (Voting right on financing preference shares) is not applicable to ABN/uni00A0AMRO since ABN/uni00A0AMRO has not issued financing preference shares.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO does not apply principle 4.4 (Issuing depositary receipts for shares). In contradiction to this principle and provision, the issuing of depositary receipts by STAK AAB is/uni00A0primarily used as a defence measure and not to prevent shareholder absenteeism from enabling a minority of shareholders to control the decision-making process at a/uni00A0General Meeting. Regulatory considerations have been decisive in choosing a structure with depositary receipts as/uni00A0a protective measure. Declarations of No Objection are required in connection with the direct or indirect acquisition of a qualified holding in regulated entities in which\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

        "page_content": "ABN/uni00A0AMRO holds an interest. Therefore, this structure provides ABN/uni00A0AMRO with the greatest possible certainty of adequate protection against a hostile takeover. Although the issuing of depositary receipts has been set up primarily as a defence measure and not to prevent absenteeism, STAK AAB aims to promote the exchange of information between ABN/uni00A0AMRO on the one hand and holders of depositary receipts and shareholders on the other by, for example, organising a meeting of depositary receipt holders before every General Meeting. More information on the purpose and functioning of the depositary receipts and STAK AAB, including information on/uni00A0situations in which STAK AAB may decide to limit, refuse or revoke powers of attorney (and to not observe any voting instructions received), can be found on the STAK AAB website (stakaab.org).\n\nCompliance with best practice provisions 4.4.1 - 4.4.5 and 4.4.7 - 4.4.8 is a responsibility of the board of STAK AAB. With respect to best practice provisions 4.4.5 and 4.4.8, the following applies. In a non-hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of depositary receipt holders. In a hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business enterprises. Under all circumstances, STAK AAB will also take into account the legitimate interests of all other stakeholders: clients, savers and deposit holders, shareholders, depositary receipt holders, employees, and the society in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates. Furthermore, STAK AAB in principle has the obligation to grant a power of attorney to depositary receipt holders to exercise the voting rights attached to the underlying shares and will not exercise voting rights on the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO (unless depositary receipt holders have requested STAK AAB to do so). The foregoing could be different in the hostile situations described in Article 2:118a of the Dutch Civil Code. STAK AAB may then decide to (a) limit, exclude or revoke powers of attorney, and (b) not observe voting instructions received for a period of up to two years. Furthermore, under the depositary receipt terms, when exercising the voting rights in a hostile situation, STAK AAB should focus primarily on the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business enterprises as set out above.\n\nPrinciple 5.1 and best practice provisions 5.1.1 - 5.1.5 are not applicable since ABN/uni00A0AMRO has a two-tier board instead of a one-tier board that these best practice provisions relate to.\n\n## How ABN/uni00A0AMRO complies with the best practice provisions for long-term value creation, culture and/uni00A0diversity\n\nIn this section we explain how ABN/uni00A0AMRO complies with the best practice provisions for long-term value creation (best practice provisions 1.1.3 and 1.1.4), diversity (best practice provisions 2.1.1 and 2.1.6) and culture (best practice provision 2.5.4).\n\n## Long-term value creation\n\n## Strategy to achieve short- and long-term value creation\n\nPlease refer to the chapter Strategy, value creation & performance in this report for a detailed explanation of the Executive Board's view on long-term value creation and the strategy for achieving it, as well as for a description of the contributions made to long-term value creation during 2021.\n\nReference is also made to the appendix in this report for a detailed overview of the value-creating topics.\n\nIn line with best practice provision 1.1.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Supervisory Board (i) supervises the manner in which the Executive Board implements the long-term value creation strategy, and (ii) regularly discusses the strategy, its implementation and the principles associated with it.\n\nThis role of the Supervisory Board is incorporated in the Supervisory Board Rules of Procedure:\n\n- H The Supervisory Board discusses, monitors and constructively challenges the Executive Board with respect to the group's strategy, including the long-term value creation strategy, and the values that contribute to a culture focused on long-term value creation.\n- H At least once every calendar year, the Supervisory Board discusses the long-term value creation strategy and its implementation. The Supervisory Board also assesses the actual outcome of the strategy and objectives formulated in the preceding period(s).\n- H The Executive Board discusses the progress and realisation of the long-term strategy with the Supervisory Board on a quarterly basis.\n- H The exercise of all powers and duties by the Executive Board and the cooperation with the Supervisory Board focus on ensuring long-term value creation by the group and on building and maintaining the culture required for that purpose, taking into account stakeholder interests and applicable legislation and regulations.\n\nPlease refer to the Supervisory Board report for more information on the/uni00A0Supervisory Board's involvement in establishing the strategy and the way in which it monitors its implementation.\n\n## Diversity Supervisory Board profile\n\nIn line with best practice provision 2.1.1 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board has drawn up a profile of its scope and composition, taking into account the nature and activities of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. The current collective profile is set out in Annex 3 of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, which are published on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's website.

This is part of the ABN/uni00A0AMRO Suitability Policy.\n\nPlease refer to the Leadership and governance structure chapter in this report for details on gender diversity within ABN/uni00A0AMRO's management bodies.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusion Policy\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is committed to diversity and inclusion, including promoting equal treatment of and equal opportunities for employees, preventing harassment, ensuring non-discrimination and ensuring compliance with national and local labour and employment laws. A summary of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Diversity & Inclusion Policy is published on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's website.\n\nThe objective of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Diversity & Inclusion Policy is to create a diverse and inclusive workforce and to recognise the human rights and equal opportunities of all the bank's employees. To achieve this objective, all ABN/uni00A0AMRO employees, regardless of their position, must adhere to the following principles:\n\n- H displaying respect for every individual;\n- H drawing strength from equal opportunities and a diverse and inclusive workforce, while supporting personal growth and development;\n- H recognising the value and benefiting from the uniqueness of every individual;\n- H displaying respect for the human rights of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's employees.\n\n## Diversity targets,/uni00A0initiatives and achievements\n\nPlease refer to the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter of this report for detailed information on diversity targets,/uni00A0initiatives and achievements.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's results are monitored internally and externally by, for example, the SER (Talent to the Top) and Equileap. This year, ABN/uni00A0AMRO received a Diamond Award from Talent to the Top for its achievements in cultural diversity. We also came third in Equileap's annual ranking of the 100 best-performing Dutch companies in terms of gender equality, making ABN/uni00A0AMRO the top financial institution in this respect in the Netherlands. Internally, our efforts were rewarded with a higher overall score in our Employee Engagement Survey.\n\n## Culture\n\n## Our culture and core values\n\nPlease refer to the chapter Introduction - Our bank for a description of our culture and core values.\n\n## Bringing our values to life\n\nPlease refer to the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter for details on how ABN/uni00A0AMRO brings our values to life.\n\n## Culture and long-term value creation\n\nAs a value-driven organisation, our decisions and behaviour need to be in line with our purpose and strategy. At ABN/uni00A0AMRO, we are fully committed to our moderate risk profile and our role as a gatekeeper of the financial system, which is why culture and our licence to operate are clear priorities for us. We place great value on fostering a culture within ABN/uni00A0AMRO in which everyone feels respected and valued. Taking ownership, setting clear targets and being accountable are key to strategy execution and our licence to operate./uni00A0\n\nOur culture reflects our purpose. Over the last couple of years, we have started to work on various projects, including projects that define value-creating topics (as described under long-term value creation above), our group of stakeholders and our value creation strategy so as to increase awareness, and to foster and embed the integrated thinking culture in the organisation and the leadership teams. In our decision-making process, the 'value-creating topic ambassadors' are those who close the loop by embedding, monitoring and reporting on the progress of that specific value-creating topic.\n\nLeadership and culture are inextricably connected. The Executive Board - our most senior leadership body - and the Extended Leadership Team set the tone, the example and the standards that we expect of everyone.\n\nDilemma reconciliation is a module in our executive leadership programme and aims to build the competency of reconciling seemingly conflicting interests of stakeholders or of timing (longer-term versus shorter-term imperatives).\n\nWhere norms, rules or standards are insufficiently clear or pose a dilemma, ABN/uni00A0AMRO invests in moral learning and moral decision-making. Our Ethics Committee, chaired by the CEO, discusses ethical dilemmas on a strategic level to/uni00A0determine ABN/uni00A0AMRO's moral position in areas where regulations or policies do not provide clear guidance./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThroughout the organisation, moral position sessions, dilemma dialogues and speak-up cafes are being used to help improve ethical decision-making skills and help determine what is right, taking into account the rights and interests of all stakeholders. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has strengthened the approachability and awareness of the various speak-up channels, ranging from speak-up ambassadors in the workplace to trusted persons and the whistleblowing hotline, in order to lower the threshold for speaking up, giving voice to values and signalling risks or possible issues./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

The Dutch Banking Code applies to ABN/uni00A0AMRO as the main entity within a group that holds a Dutch banking licence.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is therefore committed to complying with the Dutch Banking Code and devotes a great deal of effort to ensuring that the spirit of the code is reflected in the behaviour of its employees and the culture of the bank. As such, we are pleased to confirm that ABN/uni00A0AMRO complies with the principles of the Dutch Banking Code. A principleby-principle overview of the manner in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO complied with the Dutch Banking Code during 2021 is published on abnamro.com.\n\nThroughout 2021, we continued to improve the manner in which we apply the principles of the Dutch Banking Code, taking into account the focus areas indicated by the Dutch Banking Code Monitoring Committee. In particular, the bank devoted a great deal of attention to certain strategic differentiators, such as Responsible investment and financing, Diversity & equal opportunity and Customer experience, in order to achieve the goals of the Banking Code's/uni00A0Social Charter. Increased efforts were also put into implementing the strategic pillars, including implementing the new organisational structure, which is aimed at simplifying the organisation and improving our efficiency.\n\nDuring 2021, further improvements were made to the process of succession planning, permanent education and self-assessments performed at board level. All members of the Supervisory Board and Executive Board of ABN/uni00A0AMRO have taken the Banker's Oath, as required by Dutch law. The oath is a confirmation of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's existing policies, which are fully in line with the bank's cultural principles and core values. As well as introducing a Social Charter and the\n\nBanking Code, the Dutch banking industry has taken the initiative to have all employees take the Banker's Oath. Employees take the oath to affirm their commitment to upholding high standards of ethical behaviour. They are personally responsible for complying with the Code of Conduct and may be held accountable for non-compliance.\n\n## Subsidiaries of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the Dutch Banking/uni00A0Code\n\nOn 31 December 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO had four Dutch subsidiaries with a banking licence: ABN/uni00A0AMRO Clearing Bank N.V., ABN/uni00A0AMRO Groenbank B.V., ABN/uni00A0AMRO Hypotheken Groep B.V. and International Card Services B.V. ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies the principles of the Dutch Banking Code to all these Dutch subsidiaries on a consolidated basis by developing group-wide policies and standards that promote compliance with internal and external rules and best-practice provisions. In view, however, of the differences in the activities, organisation and risk management of the subsidiaries, the application of groupwide policies and standards may vary from one subsidiary to another. An explanation of the manner in which these subsidiaries comply with the Dutch Banking Code is published on abnamro.com.\n\n## CRD V\n\nArticle 96 of CRD V requires financial institutions to explain on their website how they comply with the requirements of Articles 88 - 95 of CRD V. These articles set out governance, disclosure, remuneration, nomination and management body requirements for financial institutions. The obligation to publish such an overview was implemented in Dutch law by Article 134b of the Decree on prudential measures FMSA ( Besluit prudenti\u00eble regels Wft ).\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has published an overview of how the bank complies with Article 134b of the Prudential Measures Decree and Article 96 of CRD V on abnamro.com.",

This section describes ABN AMRO Bank's significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates or judgements relating to the Annual Financial Statements. Ifan accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a specific note, it is included in the relevant note.\n\n## Corporate information\n\nABN AMRO Bank N.V. (referred to as ABN AMRO Bank, ABN AMRO, the bank or the parent company) and its consolidated entities provide financial services in the Netherlands and abroad (together referred to as the group). ABN AMRO Bank is a public limited liability company, incorporated under Dutch law on 9 April 2009 in the Netherlands, and registered at Gustav Mahlerlaan 10, 1082 PP Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Chamber of Commerce number 34334259).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, all shares in the capital of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. are held by two foundations: NLFI and STAK AAB. NLFI holds 56.3% in ABN AMRO Bank N.V., of which 49.9% is held directly via ordinary shares and 6.4% is held indirectly via depositary receipts for shares in ABN AMRO Bank N.V. STAK AAB holds 50.1% of the shares in the issued capital of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. Both foundations have issued depositary receipts for shares in ABN AMRO Bank N.V. Only STAK AAB's depositary receipts are issued with the cooperation of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and traded on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nABN AMRO provides a broad range of financial services to retail, private and corporate banking clients. These activities are conducted primarily in the Netherlands and selectively abroad.\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements of ABN AMRO Bank for the year ended 31 December 2021 incorporate financial information of ABN AMRO Bank N.V., its controlled entities, interests in associates and joint ventures. The Annual Financial Statements were prepared by the Executive Board and authorised for issue by the Supervisory Board and Executive Board on 8 March 2022.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). They also comply with the financial reporting requirements set out in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, where applicable.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities held for trading or designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss, financial instruments not held in a 'hold to collect' business model, debt instruments that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test, and equity investments in associates or joint ventures for which the venture capital exemption is applied, all of which are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged items in fair value hedges, and otherwise carried at amortised cost, are adjusted to record changes in fair value attributable to the risks that are being hedged. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nManagement has considered the consequences of Covid-19 and other events and conditions, and has determined that\n\ntheydo not create a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt on the bank's ability to continue as a going concern. Theimpact of Covid-19 on future performance and therefore on the measurement of assets, mainly loans and advances, issignificant and therefore requires disclosure in the financial statements, but management has determined that these events and conditions do not create a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue asagoing concern. The Annual Financial Statements have therefore been prepared on the going-concern basis.\n\nThe Annual Financial Statements are presented in euros, which is the presentation currency of ABN AMRO, rounded to the nearest million (unless otherwise stated).",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Presentation of net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nDue to rise in sales of financial assets at amortised cost during 2021, the net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost are presented as a separate line item in the income statement. Previously, the net gains/ (losses) were part of other operating income.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe following new standards were endorsed by the EU and became effective for the reporting period beginning 1 January 2021.\n\n- H Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021\n- H Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n- H Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts - deferral of IFRS 9\n\nOnly the amendments related to the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform have resulted in a change in ABN AMRO's accountingpolicies.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nIn response to the IBOR reform, the IASB has issued two sets of amendments to IFRS Standards. The amendments provide practical relief for companies from certain requirements when changes are made to contractual cash flows or hedging relationships because of IBOR reforms, and provide additional disclosure requirements. With effect from 1 January 2020, ABN AMRO applies the first set of amendments made to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 that address the pre-replacement phase or phase 1 issues introduced by the IBOR reform. The phase 1 amendments allow a company to apply temporary reliefs to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by the IBOR reform. Applying the relief prevents the disruption of hedging relationships as a result of uncertainty caused by the IBOR reform. The adoption of the amendments has not resulted in anyimpact on profit or loss or on the statement of financial position. In August 2020, the IASB issued the second set of amendments to address the issues caused by the replacement phase of the IBOR reform. Amendments have been made toIFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16. The phase 2 amendments took effect on 1 January 2021 and are applied by ABN AMRO as of that date. These amendments focus on replacement issues, i.e. when an interest rate benchmark is replaced with an alternative, and comprise reliefs regarding to accounting for changes and hedge accounting.\n\nWhile ABN AMRO operates in global financial markets, the majority of its financial instruments are linked to the euro area key interest rate benchmarks EONIA and EURIBOR. EONIA is being replaced by \u20acSTR and was discontinued on 3 January 2022. Since October 2019, EONIA has been calculated as \u20acSTR plus a fixed spread of 8.5 basis points. EURIBOR has been calculated using a hybrid methodology since 2019 and will not be reformed in the short-term. The IBOR reform in the euro area did not affect the basis of contractual cash flows or hedging relationships in 2021. Other key financial benchmarks are also being reformed, most notably the London InterBank Offered Rates (LIBOR) in the five LIBOR currencies: USD, GBP, EUR, JPY and CHF. In March 2021, it was announced by the administrator of LIBOR and the FCA that LIBOR would not be published after 31 December 2021. This applies with the exception of USD LIBOR, which is expected to be phased out after 30 June 2023.\n\nDuring 2021, ABN AMRO amended existing loan and derivative contracts to prepare for the discontinuation of the LIBOR rates. In December 2021, all centrally cleared swaps referring to CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR were migrated to risk-free rates. The remaining exposures at the year-end consist solely of bilateral contracts referencing GBP LIBOR that still have to transition. For these trades, the temporary use of a synthetic LIBOR is in place. USD LIBOR rates are still published and contracts referring to this index are expected to be repapered in the next 18 months.\n\n## New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective (endorsed)\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 sets out requirements for the accounting, measurement and recognition of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 is expected to be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nABN AMRO offers only limited insurance products. ABN AMRO has two equity accounted investments that have insurance products. IFRS 17 may have a significant impact on these equity accounted investments, but ABN AMRO does not anticipate that the impact will be material to its consolidated financial statements.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet endorsed\n\nIn February and May 2021, the International Accounting Standards Board issued a number of amendments to existing standards, which are to to take effect on 1 January 2023. The standards amended are IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, and IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU and are therefore not open to early adoption. The expected impact of these changes on the consolidated financial statements is insignificant.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management needs to exercise its judgement in the process of applying ABN AMRO's accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. Accounting policies for the most significant areas that require management to make judgements and estimates affecting reported amounts and disclosures are made in the following sections:\n\n- H Impairment losses on financial assets measured at AC - Risk, funding & capital management section;\n- H Income tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities - Note 11;\n- H Impairment of instruments measured at FVOCI - Note 17;\n- H Fair value of financial instruments - Note 19;\n- H Impairment of ROU assets and goodwill - Note 24;\n- H Provisions - Note 30.\n\n## Assessment of risks, rewards and control\n\nWhenever ABN AMRO is required to assess risks, rewards and control, as well as when considering the recognition and derecognition of assets or liabilities and the consolidation or deconsolidation of subsidiaries, it may sometimes be required to use judgement. Although management uses its best knowledge of current events and actions in making such assessments, the actual risks, rewards and control may ultimately differ.\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. include the financial statements of the parent company and its controlled entities, thus incorporating the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and its subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests (held by third parties) in the equity and results of group companies are presented separately in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\nSubsidiaries are included using the same reporting period and consistent accounting policies. Intercompany balances andtransactions, as well as any related unrealised gains and losses, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated FinancialStatements.\n\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of ABN AMRO's interest in the entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment in the asset transferred.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nABN AMRO applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Transactions in foreign currencies aretranslated into euros at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Foreign currency balances of monetary items aretranslated into euros at period-end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are recognised intheincome statement.\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements are stated in euros, which is the presentation and functional currency of ABN AMRO. The bank's foreign operations may have different functional currencies. The functional currency is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying event and circumstances relevant to that entity. Prior to consolidation (or equity accounting), the assets and liabilities of non-euro operations are translated into euros at the closing rate, and items in the income statement and other comprehensive income are translated at the rate prevailing on the transaction dates. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in the currency translation reserve within equity. These are transferred to the income statement when the bank loses control, joint control or significant influence over the foreign operation.",

The business model is determined at portfolio level. Portfolios are based on how ABN AMRO manages financial assets in order to achieve a particular business objective. The business model assessment is based on the level of sales, risk management, performance evaluation and management compensation. Derecognition is used as a condition to determine whether a transaction results in a sale.\n\nThree business models are distinguished:\n\n- H 'Hold to collect' business model, in which cash flows are primarily generated by collecting contractual cash flows until maturity of the financial instrument. Sales can occur, as long as they are incidental, infrequent and insignificant. The assessment of the frequency and significance of sales is determined for each underlying portfolio. Sales that result from increases in the credit risk of the counterparty or take place close to maturity do not contradict the 'hold to collect' business model;\n- H 'Hold to collect and sell' business model, in which the selling of financial assets is integral to achieving the business objective. In this business model, sales take place more frequently and have a greater value than in a hold-to-collect business model;\n- H Other business models not meeting the criteria of the business models mentioned above, for example business models in which financial assets are managed with the objective of generating cash flows from sales (trading book), are measured at FVTPL.\n\nAfter the business model has been determined, the contractual cash flows of financial assets are assessed. Debt instruments can be classified at amortised cost or FVOCI only when the contractual cash flows are solely payments ofprincipal and interest (SPPI). Contractual cash flows that are SPPI are consistent with a basic lending arrangement inwhich consideration for the time value of money and credit risk are typically the most significant interest elements. Debtinstruments that do not meet the SPPI requirements are mandatorily measured at FVTPL. Financial assets are assessed\n\nin their entirety, including any embedded derivatives that are not separated from the host contract.\n\nBased on the business model determined and the SPPI assessment, the following measurement categories are identified under IFRS 9:\n\n- H Amortised cost - Financial instruments measured at amortised cost are debt instruments within a 'hold to collect' business model with fixed or determinable payments which meet the SPPI criteria. These instruments are initially measured at fair value (including transaction costs) and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial instruments measured at amortised cost are presented net of credit loss allowances in the statement of financial position;\n- H FVTPL - Financial instruments measured at FVTPL include instruments held for trading, derivatives, equity instruments for which the FVOCI option has not been elected and instruments whose cash flows do not meet the SPPI requirements. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are directly recognised in the income statement;\n- H FVOCI - Financial instruments measured at FVOCI are debt instruments which are held in a 'hold to collect and sell' business model and which meet the SPPI criteria. They are initially measured at fair value, with subsequent unrealised changes recognised in other comprehensive income. Equity instruments for which the fair value option is elected are alsomeasured at FVOCI.\n\nReclassifications of financial assets are expected to be very infrequent and occur only when ABN AMRO changes its business model for a certain portfolio of financial assets.\n\nPlease refer to the Risk, funding & capital management section for our accounting policies on the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI.\n\n## Classification of assets and liabilities held for trading\n\nA financial asset or financial liability is classified as held for trading if it is:\n\n- H Acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term;\n- H Part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking; or\n- H A trading derivative (except for a derivative that is a designated and effective hedging instrument).\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Classification and measurement of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value. Under IFRS 9, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for the following instruments:\n\n- H Financial liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n- H Financial liabilities that ABN AMRO has irrevocably designated at initial recognition as held at fair value through profit orloss when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch are managed on the basis of their fair value orinclude terms that have derivative characteristicsby nature.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, the changes in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of financial liabilities designated at FVTPL arepresented in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk ofsuch liabilities is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity.\n\nFinancial liabilities are never reclassified after initial recognition.\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nTraded instruments are recognised on the trade date, which is defined as the date on which ABN AMRO commits to purchase or sell the underlying instrument. If the settlement terms are non-standard, the commitment is accounted forasaderivative between the trade and settlement dates. Loans and advances are recognised when they are acquired orfunded by ABN AMRO and derecognised when settled. Issued debt is recognised when issued, and deposits are recognised when the cash is deposited with ABN AMRO. Other financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, arerecognised when ABN AMRO becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the asset or liability.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when ABN AMRO loses control and the ability to obtain benefits from the contractual rights that comprise that asset. This occurs when the rights are realised or expire, or when substantially all risks and rewards are transferred. Financial assets are also derecognised if the bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership, but control has passed to the transferee. Financial assets continue to be recognised in the balance sheet, and a liability recognised for the proceeds of any related funding transaction, unless a fully proportional share of all or specifically identified cash flows are transferred to the lender without material delay and the lender's claim is limited to those cash flows, and substantially all the risks, rewards and control associated with the financial instruments, that have been transferred, in which case that proportion of the asset is derecognised.\n\nWhen the terms and conditions of a financial asset have been renegotiated or otherwise modified to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new financial asset, ABN AMRO derecognises the financial asset, with the difference recognised in the income statement, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised financial asset is classified as stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes. ABN AMRO assesses, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, whether such modifications are substantial. Generally, a 10% change in the net present value of thecashflows between the initial and new contract results in a derecognition. With regard to substantial modifications, e.g.dueto forbearance measures, the derecognition gains or losses are recognised in net gains/(losses) on derecognition offinancial assets measured at amortised cost and disclosed separately, if material.\n\nIf the modification of the financial asset does not result in derecognition, the gross carrying amount of the financial asset isrecalculated, based on the net present value of the new contractual cash flows, and discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The effect is recognised and disclosed as a modification loss in the income statement. Creditrelated modification gains or losses (i.e. due to forbearance measures) are recognised in the income statement andpresented under impairment charges on financial instruments. Non-credit related modification gains or losses are recognised in the income statement and presented under interest income calculated using the effective interest method.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms, qualitatively and quantitatively (a 10% difference in the present value of the cash flows), is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the former amortised cost and the consideration paid is recognised in the income statement. Any subsequent resale is treated as a new issuance.\n\n## Client clearing\n\nAs a general clearing member, ABN AMRO provides clearing and settlement services to its clients for, among other things, exchange-traded derivatives.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn its capacity as a clearing member, ABN AMRO guarantees the fulfilment of obligations towards central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs) of clients' transactions. ABN AMRO is not liable to clients for the non-performance of the CCP. Intheevent of a client defaulting, ABN AMRO has the legal obligation to settle all the client's positions with the relevant CCPs, possibly at a loss. Possible losses arising from this guarantee might relate not only to a client's current positions, butalso to the client's future trades. ABN AMRO receives and collects (cash) margins from clients, and remits these marginsto the relevant CCP in whole or in part. Given the stringent margin requirements set by the CCPs, possible future outflows of resources for new clearing transactions are considered close to zero.\n\nABN AMRO does not reflect the exchange-traded derivatives cleared on behalf of clients in its financial statements. Under normal circumstances, the guarantee has no fair value and is not recognised in the financial statements. Any loss recognised in the event of non-performance of a client is in line with our contingent liabilities policy.\n\n## Offsetting\n\nThe bank offsets financial assets and liabilities and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if it is legally entitled to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle theliability simultaneously.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, freely available balances with central banks and other banks, and net balances on current accounts with other banks with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition. The statement of cash flows, based on the indirect method of calculating operating cash flows, gives details of the source of cash and cash equivalents which became available during the year and the application ofthese cash and cash equivalents over the course of the year. The cash flows are analysed into cash flows from operations, including banking activities, investment activities and financing activities. Movements in loans and advances and interbank deposits are included in the cash flow from operating activities. Investment activities are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments, as well as investments in, and sales of, subsidiaries and associates, property and equipment. The issuing of shares and the borrowing and repayment of long-term funds are treated as financing activities. Cash flows arising from foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rates at the date of the cash flows.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis over the periods that the related expenses, which the grants are intended to compensate, are recognised. In the case of an income-related grant, the grant is deducted from the related expense.\n\n## Levies and other regulatory charges\n\nABN AMRO recognises a liability arising from levies and similar charges when it becomes legally enforceable (i.e. when the obligating event arises).\n\n## 2 Segment reporting\n\n## Accounting policy for segment reporting\n\nThe segment reporting/uni00A0is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the Executive Board, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance and has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker. All transactions between segments are eliminated as intersegment revenues and expenses in Group Functions. Geographical data are presented according to the management view.\n\nSegment assets, liabilities, income and results are measured based on our accounting policies and include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Transactions between segments are/uni00A0conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nInterest income is reported as net interest income because management primarily relies on net interest income as a performance measure, not gross income and expense.\n\nThere was no revenue from transactions with a single external client or counterparty exceeding 10% of the bank's total revenue in 2021 or 2020.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

Interest income on residential mortgages also decreased, driven by lower volumes and margins due to severe market competition and high redemption of mortgages with relatively high margins.\n\nNet fee and commission income rose to EUR/uni00A0312/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A0303/uni00A0million), showing recovery in credit card usage (ICS) and payment service fee income.\n\nNet income from other operating activities was EUR/uni00A0108/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A037/uni00A0million), reflecting positive revaluation results on the ventures portfolio, including EUR/uni00A041/uni00A0million on Tink.\n\nPersonnel expenses amounted to EUR/uni00A0416/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0408/uni00A0million), mainly due to the upscaling of AML/uni00A0activities./uni00A0\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by EUR/uni00A0104/uni00A0million, totalling EUR/uni00A0760/uni00A0million in 2021.

However, payment service fee income partly recovered during the second half of the year.\n\nNet income from other operating activities increased to EUR/uni00A042/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A025/uni00A0million).\n\nPersonnel expenses were EUR/uni00A014/uni00A0million higher, totalling EUR/uni00A0257/uni00A0million in 2021, mainly related to the increase in/uni00A0FTEs for/uni00A0regulatory projects and strategic initiatives and, to a lesser extent, to wage inflation.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to EUR/uni00A0166/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0138/uni00A0million), mainly due to the upscaling of AML activities and higher regulatory levies.\n\nImpairment charges decreased significantly to EUR/uni00A041/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0542/uni00A0million), mainly due to model-based releases and limited individual additions in 2021. In 2020, high individual stage 3 impairments (mainly attributable to the food, shipping, and industrial goods and services sectors) were recorded.\n\n## Private Banking\n\nNet interest income was broadly stable at EUR/uni00A0634/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0637/uni00A0million), despite continued pressure/uni00A0on/uni00A0deposit margins./uni00A0To mitigate much of the pressure on deposit margins, ABN/uni00A0AMRO started charging negative rates of/uni00A0interest on client deposits and also lowered the charging threshold in phases (deposit threshold: Q1 2021: EUR/uni00A0500/uni00A0thousand; Q3/uni00A02021: EUR/uni00A0150 thousand; and Q1 2022: EUR/uni00A0100 thousand).\n\nNet fee and commission income increased significantly to EUR/uni00A0602/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A0502/uni00A0million), mainly attributable to higher asset management fee income resulting from a higher client asset base and favourable stock market developments.\n\nNet income from other operating activities totalled EUR/uni00A025/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0283/uni00A0million), largely because the/uni00A0figures for 2020 included the EUR/uni00A0263/uni00A0million book gain on the sale of the Neuflize OBC office building in Paris./uni00A0\n\nPersonnel expenses increased to EUR/uni00A0391/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0371/uni00A0million), mainly due to the increase in/uni00A0FTEs for/uni00A0strategic initiatives./uni00A0\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were broadly stable at EUR/uni00A0190/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0187/uni00A0million).",

This was offset by a decline in CIB non-core because of the reduction in activities as a result of the wind-down.\n\nNet income from other operating activities was EUR/uni00A075/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A0111/uni00A0million negative), mainly reflecting a/uni00A0favourable result from private equity investments.\n\nNet trading income totalled EUR/uni00A0197/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0165/uni00A0million), largely driven by more favourable CVA/DVA/FVA results.\n\nNet losses on derecognition of financial assets amounted to EUR/uni00A0106/uni00A0million negative in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A09/uni00A0million negative). The decrease was largely attributable to a discount to book value on a loan disposal as part of the wind-down of/uni00A0the CIB non-core portfolio, booked in Q2 2021.\n\nPersonnel expenses /uni00A0were down EUR/uni00A054/uni00A0million at EUR/uni00A0430/uni00A0million in 2021, impacted by a one-off provision for the CIB/uni00A0non-core wind-down and discretionary variable remuneration, both in 2020. The decrease was partly offset by higher expenses at CIB core due to the increase in/uni00A0FTEs and overall wage inflation.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by EUR/uni00A018/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0302/uni00A0million in 2021, mainly due to higher expenses relating to regulatory projects and strategic initiatives, as well as higher levies.\n\nImpairment charges recorded a net release of EUR/uni00A037/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A01,659/uni00A0million addition). The figure for 2020 primarily comprised stage 3 additions for (non-core) TCF clients, mainly in the energy sector.\n\n## Group Functions\n\nNet interest income improved to EUR/uni00A0198/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A06/uni00A0million negative). Excluding large incidentals, the main reason for the increase in net interest income was the additional TLTRO discount (EUR/uni00A093/uni00A0million) and higher mortgage prepayment penalties. The discount is being entirely passed on to our clients.\n\nNet fee and commission income was EUR/uni00A021/uni00A0million negative in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A031/uni00A0million negative), largely owing to lower fees paid to securities financing.\n\nNet income from other operating activities amounted to EUR/uni00A0413/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A080/uni00A0million), largely owing to/uni00A0the gain on the sale and leaseback of the Amsterdam head office (EUR/uni00A0327/uni00A0million). This was partly offset by lower hedging accounting-related income (2021: EUR/uni00A040/uni00A0million versus 2020: EUR/uni00A059/uni00A0million).\n\nNet trading income totalled EUR/uni00A050/uni00A0million negative in 2021 and included a net negative impact of EUR/uni00A049/uni00A0million due to the repayment of German dividend withholding tax credits and accrued interest relating to transactions that might be considered as cum/cum transactions. The amounts have been repaid in anticipation of a decision by the German tax authorities.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased by EUR/uni00A057/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0831/uni00A0million in 2021, mainly due to the upscaling of AML activities reflected in the increase in/uni00A0FTEs and, to a lesser extent, to wage inflation.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses rose to EUR/uni00A01,870/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A01,412/uni00A0million), including AML settlement (EUR/uni00A0480/uni00A0million). Excluding large incidentals, general and administrative expenses increased in 2021, mainly due to the upscaling of AML activities.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

The/uni00A0effective interest rate method allocates interest, amortisation of any discount or premium or other differences, including transaction costs and qualifying fees and commissions, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of the asset. As a result, this method requires ABN AMRO to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of client behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. Interest on loans and advances measured at fair value through profit or loss is also included in net interest income/uni00A0and recognised using the contractual interest rate. Interest income and expense on trading balances is included in net trading income. Interest paid on assets with a negative interest yield is classified as interest expense. Interest received from liabilities with a negative interest yield is classified as interest income.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                            | 2021     | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income calculated using the effective interest method  | 6,760    | 7,525  |        |\n| Other interest and similar income                               | 258      | 290    |        |\n| Interest income                                                 | 7, 0 1 7 |        | 7,815  |\n| Interest expense calculated using the effective interest method | 1,397    | 1,834  |        |\n| Other interest and similar expense                              | 411      | 118    |        |\n| Interest expense                                                | 1,808    |        | 1,952  |\n| Net interest income                                             | 5,210    |        | 5,863  |\n\n## Net interest income\n\nNet interest income decreased by EUR/uni00A0653/uni00A0million at 31 December 2021.

This was mainly due to lower interest expense from issued debt and subordinated liabilities as maturing debt was replaced at lower interest rates/coupons, as well as lower funding needs. The decrease was partly offset by the interest component in the provision for variable interest rates for consumer loans.\n\n## 5 Net fee and commission income\n\n## Accounting policy for net fee and commission income\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies IFRS 15 when recognising revenue from contracts with clients, all of which is included in net fee and commission income. After identifying contracts and their performance obligations, revenue is recognised as an amount that reflects the consideration to which the bank expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised services to clients. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, taking into account discounts and rebates. The amount of revenue recognised is discounted to the present value of consideration due, if payment extends beyond normal credit terms.\n\nRevenue is recognised when a promised service is transferred to the client. Fees and commissions are recognised either:\n\n- \u00c5 At a point in time: the fee is a reward for a service provided at a moment in time; or\n- \u00c5 Over time (amortised): the fee relates to services on an ongoing basis.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO engages in transactions where more than one party is involved in providing services to a client. In the case/uni00A0of these transactions, ABN/uni00A0AMRO assesses whether it is a principal or an agent in the transaction by evaluating the nature/uni00A0of its promise to the client.\n\nThe bank is a principal if it controls the promised goods or services before they are transferred to a client. The bank is acting as an agent, of another party, if it provides a service of arranging for another party to transfer goods or services to a client and, as a result, does not control the specified goods or services. Control of goods and services refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from, the goods and services.\n\nIf the bank is assessed to be a principal in the transaction, it recognises revenue in the gross amount of the consideration to/uni00A0which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified goods or services transferred. If, however, the bank acts as/uni00A0an/uni00A0agent, it recognises revenue in the amount of the fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for/uni00A0arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party. The fee or commission may be the net/uni00A0amount of consideration that the bank retains after paying the other party the consideration received in exchange for/uni00A0the/uni00A0goods or services to be provided by that party.",

It also includes the change in fair value of derivatives used for risk management purposes that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, ineffectiveness of hedging programmes, fair value changes relating to assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and changes in the value of derivatives related to such instruments. Dividend income from non-trading equity investments is recognised when entitlement is established. Income from operating lease activities is presented separately from the depreciation expense of the related assets.\n\nPrior to 2021, income from operating lease activities was measured net of depreciation of the underlying assets. In 2021, the lease income from operating lease activities became material. Therefore, income from operating lease activities is presented separately from the depreciation expenses of the underlying assets so as to better reflect the substance of the transactions.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                              |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income from lease activities                                      |    163 |    171 |\n| Disposal of operating activities and equity-accounted investments |      3 |     12 |\n| Result from financial transactions                                |    245 |    -15 |\n| Other                                                             |    395 |    293 |\n| Income from other operating activities                            |    805 |    462 |\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                     |   2021 |   2020 |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Expenses from from lease activities      |    142 |    148 |\n| Expenses from other operating activities |    142 |    148 |\n\nTotal income from other operating activities increased by EUR/uni00A0343/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0805/uni00A0million at 31 December 2021. The increase was mainly due to an increase in the result from financial transactions and, to a lesser extent, to other income.\n\nThe result from financial transactions increased by EUR/uni00A0260/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0245/uni00A0million at 31 December 2021. This was due to revaluation gains relating to equity/uni00A0interests in other entities, including the investment in Tink and Capital A funds.\n\nOther income increased by EUR/uni00A0101/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0395/uni00A0million at 31 December 2021. This increase related/uni00A0mainly to the sale and leaseback of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's head office at Gustav Mahlerlaan in 2021, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of EUR/uni00A0327/uni00A0million (EUR/uni00A0245/uni00A0million net of tax) in other operating income as part of Group Functions. Please refer to Note 24 'Property and equipment, leases, goodwill and other intangible assets' for more information on the sale and leaseback transaction.\n\n## 7 Net trading income\n\n## Accounting policy for net trading income\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, trading positions are held at fair value, and net trading income includes gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of such financial assets and liabilities. The lattercomprise gains and losses from trading financial assets and liabilities, interest income and expenses related to trading financial assets and liabilities, and dividends received from trading instruments. Dividend income and dividends from trading instruments are recognised at the dividend announcement date. Net trading income also includes changes in fair value arising from changes in counterparty credit spreads (CVA) and changes in own credit spreads (DVA) where these impact on the value of our trading assets and liabilities. The funding valuation adjustment (FVA) incorporates the incremental cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and/uni00A0partly collateralised derivatives.",

The decrease was driven/uni00A0by the negative impact of the repayment of German dividend withholding tax relating to transactions that might be/uni00A0considered as cum/cum transactions. The amounts have been repaid in anticipation of a decision by the German tax authorities. This was partially offset by the positive impact of the higher FX-volumes and improved CVA/DVA/FVA results. Commodity trading income decreased due to lower volumes in the USA.\n\nThe XVA result was mainly impacted by the decrease in the CVA reserve. The CVA reserve decreased due to an increase in interest rates and changes in counterparty credit spreads. The FVA reserve decreased due to lower funding spreads.\n\n## 8 Net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\n## Accounting policy derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost includes gains and losses recognised/uni00A0on the sale or derecognition of these financial assets, calculated as the difference between the carrying amount/uni00A0(which is the amortised cost adjusted for the loss allowance) and the proceeds received.\n\nThe net losses on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost increased by EUR/uni00A096/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0108/uni00A0million at 31 December 2021. The net losses on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise EUR/uni00A059/uni00A0million of gains and EUR/uni00A0166/uni00A0million of losses on derecognition of financial instruments at amortised cost and were mainly due to loan disposals as part of the non-core wind-down.\n\n## 9 Personnel expenses\n\n## Accounting policy for personnel expenses\n\nSalaries and wages, social security charges and other salary-related costs are recognised over the period in which the/uni00A0employees provide the services to which the payments relate. The accounting policies for pensions and other post-employment benefits are included in Note 31 Pension and other employee benefits.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                       | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Salaries and wages                                         | 1,726  | 1,540  |\n| Social security charges                                    | 220    | 216    |\n| Expenses relating to Defined post employment benefit plans | 3      | 1      |\n| Defined contribution plan expenses                         | 291    | 306    |\n| Other                                                      | 84     | 217    |\n| Total personnel expenses                                   | 2,324  | 2,280  |\n\nTotal personnel expenses increased by EUR/uni00A044/uni00A0million in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nThe increase of EUR/uni00A0186/uni00A0million in salaries and wages was mainly driven by an increase in FTE levels following the AML remediation programmes and a 2.75% increase in salaries under the Collective Labour Agreement. The wind-down at CIB was the main driver for the increase in retention payments./uni00A0\n\nThe decrease in defined contribution plan expenses of EUR/uni00A015/uni00A0million was due to a release as a result of a favourable court ruling./uni00A0This was partly offset by the increase in FTEs, resulting in higher pension costs.\n\nOther personnel expenses decreased by EUR/uni00A0133/uni00A0million, mainly due to higher restructuring provisions related to staff expenses in 2020. The decrease is also related to lower dismissal payments and short-term employee benefit expenses than in 2020, due to Covid-19 restrictions.",

Income tax is recognised in the income statement and in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period in which profits arise. Withholding taxes are included in income tax when these taxes become payable by a subsidiary, associate or joint arrangement on distributions to ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Income tax recoverable on tax-allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits arising in the current or prior period. Current tax is measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised for qualifying temporary differences. Temporary differences represent the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is both a legal right to offset and an intention to settle on a net/uni00A0basis.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                                                    | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Recognised in income statement:                                                                         |        |        |\n| Current tax expenses for the current period                                                             | 675    | 417    |\n| Adjustments recognised in the period for current tax of prior periods                                   | 1      | -68    |\n| Total current tax expense                                                                               | 676    | 349    |\n| Deferred tax arising from the current period                                                            | -41    | -100   |\n| Impact of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes                                                        | -1     | -12    |\n| Deferred tax arising from the write-down or reversal of a write-down of a deferred tax asset            | -24    | 139    |\n| Deferred tax prior period                                                                               | -9     | 27     |\n| Previously unrecognised tax losses, tax credits and temporary differences reducing deferred tax expense | 3      |        |\n| Tax expense (income) relating to changes in accounting policies and errors included in profit and loss  |        | -1     |\n| Total deferred tax expense                                                                              | -72    | 52     |\n| Total income tax expense                                                                                | 604    | 401    |\n\nThe EUR/uni00A0139/uni00A0million write-down in 2020 includes the write-down of deferred tax assets related to the wind-down of the CIB/uni00A0non-core portfolio.\n\n## Reconciliation of the total tax charge\n\nThe effective rate based on the consolidated income statement differs from the theoretical rate that would arise using the statutory tax rate of the Netherlands.

This decrease is mainly the result of an exceptionally high effective tax rate in 2020. In 2020 no full tax benefit was recognised on the provision for the CIB non-core wind-down since no deferred tax asset could be recognised on the losses in specific tax jurisdictions. The relatively high rate/uni00A0of 32.9% in 2021, compared to the standard Dutch rate of 25%, was mainly driven by the AML settlement recorded in/uni00A0Q1 2021 and the bank tax recorded in Q4 2021, which are not tax deductible.\n\n## Tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe most significant temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities, including derivative contracts, allowances for loan impairment and investments. The following table summarises the tax position.\n\n|                                  | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   | 31 December 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)             | Assets             | Liabilities        | Assets             | Liabilities        |\n| Current tax                      | 119                | 101                | 176                | 27                 |\n| Deferred tax                     | 620                |                    | 674                | 4                  |\n| Total tax assets and liabilities | 739                | 101                | 851                | 30                 |\n\nThe significant components and annual movements in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are shown in the following tables.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                             | As at   31 December  2020   | Income  statement   | OCI    | Equity   | Other   | As at   31 December  2021   | Of which:  deferred  tax asset   | Of which:  deferred  tax liability   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------|----------|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Assets and liabilities held for trading,   derivatives and financial investments | 560                         | 1                   | - 11 3 |          |         | 448                         | 538                              | 90                                   |\n| Property and equipment (excluding leases)  and/uni00A0intangible assets          | 15                          | 3                   |        |          |         | 18                          | 22                               | 4                                    |\n| Loans                                                                            | 6                           | 1                   |        |          |         | 7                           | 7                                | 1                                    |\n| Equity-accounted investments                                                     | 3                           | -3                  |        |          |         |                             |                                  |                                      |\n| Leases                                                                           | 5                           | 32                  |        |          |         | 37                          | 110                              | 72                                   |\n| Pensions and other (post-)employment benefits                                    | 20                          | -6                  | -3     |          |         | 11                          | 11                               |                                      |\n| Provisions                                                                       | 17                          | 9                   | -2     |          |         | 24                          | 24                               |                                      |\n| Tax losses carried forward                                                       | 25                          | 25                  |        |          |         | 51                          | 51                               |                                      |\n| Other                                                                            | 19                          | 9                   | -5     |          |         | 24                          | 47                               | 23                                   |\n| Deferred tax assets (+) and liabilities (-)                                      | 671                         | 72                  | -123   |          | 1       | 620                         | 811                              | 191                                  |\n| Offsetting deferred tax assets and liabilities                                   |                             |                     |        |          |         |                             | 191                              | 191                                  |\n| Net deferred tax assets (+) and liabilities (-)                                  |                             |                     |        |          |         |                             | 620                              |                                      |",

Recognition is based on estimates of sufficient taxable income by jurisdiction in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required and these could impact on our financial position and net profit. No deferred income taxes have been recognised on undistributed earnings of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's subsidiaries, branches and interests in joint ventures.\n\n## Tax losses\n\nThe total accumulated losses available for carry-forward at 31 December 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A02,550/uni00A0million (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020: EUR/uni00A02,058/uni00A0million), of which EUR/uni00A0202/uni00A0million (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A0101/uni00A0million) is recognised for/uni00A0future tax benefits. The recorded deferred tax asset for tax losses carried forward amounted to EUR/uni00A051/uni00A0million (31/uni00A0December 2020: EUR/uni00A025/uni00A0million).\n\n## Unrecognised tax assets\n\nCertain amounts of deferred tax assets are not recognised because future taxable profits are not considered probable. Deferred tax assets for an amount of EUR/uni00A083/uni00A0million (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A0126/uni00A0million) have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of EUR/uni00A0342/uni00A0million (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A0513/uni00A0million). In addition, deferred tax assets for an amount of EUR/uni00A0429/uni00A0million (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A0349/uni00A0million) have not been recognised in respect of gross tax losses of EUR/uni00A02,348/uni00A0million (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A01,957/uni00A0million). In 2022, we expect an amount of EUR/uni00A01,131/uni00A0million of the unrecognised gross tax losses to be finally written off unutilised, due to liquidation of the company holding these losses. No use for these losses could be identified.\n\n## Tax credits and unrecognised tax credits\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO did not have any carry-forward tax credits at 31 December 2021.",

The recognition of these deferred tax assets is based on a projection of future taxable income.\n\n## Tax related to equity\n\nTax related to each component of other comprehensive income and tax related to equity can be found in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\n## Income tax consequences of dividend\n\nDividends are, in principle, subject to a 15% withholding tax in the Netherlands.

Derivatives held for trading are closely related to facilitating the needs of our clients. A significant part of the derivatives in the trading portfolio is related to serving clients in their risk management to hedge, for example, currency or interest rate exposures. ABN/uni00A0AMRO also offers products that are traded on the financial markets to institutional and individual clients and governments.\n\nDerivatives held for risk management purposes include derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting and those used for economic hedges. A hedging instrument, for hedge accounting purposes, is a designated derivative whose fair value or cash flows are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of a designated hedged item.",

        "page_content": "The EUR/uni00A036.5/uni00A0billion decrease in the notional amount of interest rate derivatives held for trading was mainly due to a decrease in volume and number of trades.\n\nThe notional amount of currency derivatives held for trading decreased by EUR/uni00A012.0/uni00A0billion, mainly due to lower client activity. The notional amount on currency derivatives used for economic hedges decreased by EUR/uni00A09.4/uni00A0billion due to the maturity of various cross-currency swaps./uni00A0\n\nThe notional amount of interest rate derivatives used for hedge accounting increased by EUR/uni00A027.6/uni00A0billion. The portfolio of interest rate swaps increased as a result of interest rate risk management activities.\n\n## 16  Hedge accounting\n\n## Accounting policy for hedge accounting/uni00A0\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO enters into various derivative and non-derivative instrument transactions with external parties to hedge risks on assets, liabilities and net investments. The accounting treatment of the hedged item and the hedging instrument depends on whether the hedge relationship qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nQualifying hedges may be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments. A non-derivative financial asset or liability may be designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes only if it hedges the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The hedged item can be an asset, liability, or net investment in a foreign operation that (a) exposes the entity to the risk of changes in fair value or future cash flows, and (b) is designated as being hedged.\n\nThe hedged risks are typically changes in interest rates or foreign currency rates. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's market risk management strategy, which includes interest rate risk and foreign currency risk in the banking book, is described in more detail in the Risk, funding & capital management section.\n\nBoth at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, ABN/uni00A0AMRO assesses whether the derivatives designated in each hedging relationship are expected to be and have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. These prospective and retrospective effectiveness tests are performed by using a regression analysis. ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies the following criteria to assess whether the hedging relationship is effective:\n\n- \u00c5 A regression co-efficient (R squared), which measures the correlation between the variables in the regression; and\n- \u00c5 A slope of the regression line is within a range of 0.80-1.25.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on components of a derivative that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded directly in the result from financial transactions as part of other operating income. ABN/uni00A0AMRO discontinues hedge accounting when the hedge relationship has ceased to be effective or is no longer expected to be effective, or when the derivative or hedged item is sold or otherwise terminated.\n\n## Application of IAS 39 as endorsed by the European Union\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 9 paragraph 7.2.21, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has elected to continue applying the requirements of IAS 39 as endorsed by the European Union instead of applying the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9. The EU-endorsed version of IAS 39 provides relief from certain hedge accounting requirements when compared to the full hedge accounting text of IAS 39. One of these reliefs is that negative credit spreads can be excluded from hedge relationships. ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies this to several micro fair value hedge relationships. Another relief is that the impact of changes in the estimates of the repricing dates is considered ineffective only if it leads to over-hedging. This relief is applied in the macro fair value hedge.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies fair value hedge accounting on individual hedged items (micro fair value hedging), as well as on a portfolio of hedged items (macro fair value hedging). Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item, the hedged item is adjusted in relation to the risk being hedged. Gains or losses on remeasurement of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognised in the income statement as result from financial transactions, which is part of the line item Other operating income.",

When a fair value hedge of interest rate risk is terminated, any value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to profit or loss over the original designated hedging period, or taken directly to income if the hedged item is derecognised.\n\n## Micro fair value hedge accounting\n\nHedging instruments designated in individual fair value hedge relationships principally consist of interest rate swaps, interest rate options and cross-currency interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate liabilities due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness in micro fair value hedges are:\n\n- \u00c5 The effect of the counterparty and the bank's own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap that is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item, which is only attributable to the change in the interest rate;\n- \u00c5 The difference in discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; and\n- \u00c5 Potential differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or notes.\n\n## Macro fair value hedge accounting\n\n- \u00c5 ABN/uni00A0AMRO manages the interest rate risk arising from fixed-rate mortgages by entering into interest rate swaps. The exposure from this portfolio frequently changes due to new loans originated, contractual repayments and prepayments made by clients in each period. More than one group (or portfolio) of mortgages can be identified as the hedged item within the fixed-rate mortgage portfolio. To ensure an effective matching of hedged items and hedging instruments, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies a dynamic strategy in which hedged items are de-designated and re-designated on a monthly basis. The hedge accounting relationship is reviewed and re-designated on a monthly basis.\n\nHedged mortgages are fixed-rate mortgages with the following features:\n\n- \u00c5 denominated in local currency (euros);\n- \u00c5 fixed term to maturity or repricing;\n- \u00c5 pre-payable amortising or fixed principal amounts;\n- \u00c5 fixed interest payment dates;\n- \u00c5 no interest rate options;\n- \u00c5 accounted for on an amortised cost basis.\n\nAt each designation, the mortgage cash flows are allocated to monthly time buckets, based on the expected maturity dates. ABN/uni00A0AMRO models the maturity dates of mortgages, taking into account the modelled prepayments applied to the contractual cash flows and the maturity dates of the mortgage portfolio. If the interest rate swap notional exceeds the expected mortgage notional in any given month, taking into account the uncertainty of the expected mortgage notional by applying a haircut, mortgages that mature in adjacent buckets are designated to the interest rate swaps.\n\nChanges in the fair value of the mortgages that are attributable to the hedged interest rate risk are recognised as fair value adjustments from hedge accounting in the income statement and adjust the carrying amount of the mortgages. The recognised fair value changes in the mortgages partially offset the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps and therefore reduce the profit or loss volatility that would otherwise arise from changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps alone.\n\nAt the start of the hedge relationships and at each monthly de-designation, the difference between the fair value attributable to the hedged interest rate risk and the carrying amount of the hedged mortgages is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item.\n\nIn addition to the sources of ineffectiveness described for micro fair value hedges, the sources of ineffectiveness specifically for macro hedges are:\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

        "page_content": "- \u00c5 The difference between the expected and actual volume of prepayments for the mortgage portfolio to the extent the difference would lead to over-hedging; and\n- \u00c5 The difference in payment frequency between the fixed leg of the hedging instrument and the payment frequency of the hedged item (mortgages).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies cash flow hedge accounting to a portfolio of future cash flows on banking book assets and liabilities the hedged items - and a portfolio of interest rate swaps - the hedging instruments. The hedge relationship is reviewed on a monthly basis and the hedging instruments and hedged items are de-designated or re-designated, if necessary, to maintain an effective hedge accounting relationship.\n\nWhen a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to variability in the cash flows from a hedged item, the effective part of any gain or loss on remeasurement of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness for the macro cash flow hedge is measured as the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are in excess of changes in the fair value of the expected cash flows in the hedge relationship. Any ineffective part of the cash flow hedge is recognised in other operating income immediately. When a cash flow hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the accumulated gains or losses continue to be recognised in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\nThe gains or losses are included in the same line item as the hedged transaction. In the exceptional case that the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement immediately.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges are:\n\n- \u00c5 The effect of the counterparty and the bank's own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap that is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item, which is only attributable to the change in the interest rate; and\n- \u00c5 Potential differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or notes.\n\nThe hedged items in the macro cash flow hedge are future cash flows, which are derived from the projected balance sheet. This projected balance sheet takes the contractual terms and conditions of financial assets and liabilities and combines these with estimated prepayments, volume growth rates and interest scenarios.\n\nWithin the projected balance sheet, assets and liabilities are grouped on the basis of the specific interest rate index on which they reprice (e.g. one month, three months, six months, twelve months). For each repricing index, all assets and liabilities are allocated on a gross basis to monthly buckets in which they reprice up until their maturity.\n\nThe notional amounts of the interest rate swaps, which can be either pay or receive floating interest, are also grouped per interest rate index and allocated to monthly repricing buckets until their maturity. The hedge relationship is established by designating the interest rate swap cash flows per bucket to the corresponding bucket of projected cash flows of the hedged items. The hedged risk identified is the benchmark rate that applies to the buckets. If there are no projected cash flows available in the corresponding bucket for the applicable benchmark rate, the interest rate swap cash flows are designated to projected cash flows in a bucket with a different benchmark. The availability of projected cash flows in the buckets is not constant over time and is therefore evaluated on a monthly basis. Changes in cash flow projections may lead to a revision of the designation. Back-testing is performed on the interest rate risk models. Historical data are used to review the assumptions applied.\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO may enter into foreign currency derivatives and currency borrowings to hedge various net investments in foreign operations. For such hedges, currency translation differences arising on translation of the currency of these instruments to euros are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve in other comprehensive income, insofar as they are effective. The accumulated gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement on the disposal of the foreign operation.",

        "page_content": "## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has analysed its significant hedging relationships directly affected by the benchmark reform. Most of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's financial instruments are linked to euro area benchmarks and, as a result, so are its hedging relationships. Neither EONIA, which is published alongside its replacement \u20acSTR, nor EURIBOR cause uncertainties to arise with respect to hedged risk and/or the timing and amount of cash flows in hedging relationships. In the case of EONIA, this is because its/uni00A0replacement is already known and because ABN/uni00A0AMRO has not designated EONIA in any of its hedging relationships. In/uni00A0the case of EURIBOR, this is because it has already been revised in order to be BMR-compliant and no reform is anticipated in the short term. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's hedging relationships affected by the IBOR reform consequently/uni00A0comprise only/uni00A0a/uni00A0small percentage of its total hedging relationships.\n\nA total of EUR 163.5 billion of notional derivatives were part of hedging relationships at 31 December 2021, of which\n\nEUR/uni00A0146.5 billion was linked to EURIBOR and EUR 17.1 billion to other benchmarks. Of the derivative contracts linked to a non-EURIBOR benchmark, a notional amount of EUR 11.4 billion will mature before the cessation of the reference benchmark. These contracts are therefore not affected by the IBOR reform. A remaining total of EUR 5.6 billion notional is exposed to benchmarks under reform. The contracts exposed to benchmarks under reform have an average maturity of 4.1 years and are/uni00A0all referencing 3 months USD LIBOR.\n\nAt year-end, the only IBOR reform exposures remaining were contracts that reference an IBOR rate that has yet to transition. Contracts that reference a USD LIBOR rate, but will mature before cessation are excluded from the overview.\n\nFor non-derivative asset contracts referring to a LIBOR rate that ceased to exist at year-end 2021, a notional amount of/uni00A0EUR/uni00A022 million remained. All other contracts were repapered. Contracts referring to USD LIBOR amounted to EUR/uni00A09.8/uni00A0billion.\n\nFor non-derivative liability contracts, there were no contracts referring to a LIBOR rate that ceased to exist at year-end 2021.\n\nFor derivative contracts referencing GBP LIBOR, a notional amount of EUR 313 million was outstanding. Derivative contracts referring to USD LIBOR amounted to EUR 81.9 billion notional (gross value, hence no offsetting effects shown), of which the majority has a maturity before the USD LIBOR cessation date. The exposure after cessation date is EUR 33.7 billion, of which EUR 10.1 billion relates to bilateral contracts.\n\n## 17  Financial investments\n\n## Accounting policy for financial investments\n\nFinancial investments include financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\n## Accounting policy for financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUnrealised gains and losses on FVOCI assets are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Interest earned, premiums, discounts and qualifying transaction costs of interest-earning FVOCI assets are amortised to income on an effective interest rate basis. When FVOCI debt instruments are sold, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to other operating income in the income statement. The impairment loss resulting from the ECL on FVOCI debt instruments is recognised in the impairment charges on financial instruments in the income statement. The related loss allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the FVOCI debt instruments. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's impairment assessment and measurement approach for FVOCI debt instruments is set out in Credit risk management in the Risk, funding & capital management chapter. Fair value changes in equity instruments that are irrevocably designated as FVOCI upon initial recognition are recognised in other comprehensive income and not subsequently reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Accounting policy for financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss\n\nFinancial investments can be designated at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (an accounting mismatch). ABN/uni00A0AMRO also has financial instruments that are mandatorily measured at fair value because they do not meet the SPPI test.",

ABN/uni00A0AMRO has developed models to determine such credit losses. These are explained in more detail in the Risk, funding & capital management section. Impairment charges on FVOCI instruments are recorded in (un)realised gains/(losses) fair value through OCI in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial investments measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                        |   31 December 2021 |   31 December 2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Private equities and venture capital                        |                369 |                521 |\n| Equity securities                                           |                211 |                334 |\n| Total investments held at fair value through profit or loss |                580 |                855 |\n\nThe decrease in financial investments measured at fair value through profit or loss mainly related to the sale of the Maas Capital Shipping portfolio as part of the CIB non-core wind-down. There was also a decrease in funds held as money market funds under client segregation requirements.\n\n## 18  Securities financing\n\n## Accounting policy for securities financing\n\nSecurities financing is measured at amortised cost. Securities financing consists of securities borrowing and lending and sale and repurchase transactions. Securities borrowing and securities lending transactions are generally entered into on a collateralised basis, with securities usually advanced or received as collateral. The transfer of the securities themselves is not reflected in the statement of financial position unless the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred. If cash is advanced or received, securities borrowing and lending activities are recorded at the amount of cash advanced (included in loans and advances) or received (due to banks or customers). The market value of the securities borrowed or lent is monitored on a daily basis, and the collateral levels are adjusted in accordance with the underlying transactions. Fees and interest received or paid are recognised on an effective interest rate basis and recorded as interest income or interest expense.\n\nSale and repurchase transactions involve purchases (or sales) of investments with agreements to resell (or repurchase) substantially identical investments at a certain date in the future at a fixed price. Investments purchased subject to commitments to resell them at future dates are not recognised. The amounts paid are recognised in loans and advances to either banks or customers and are shown as collateralised by the underlying security.\n\nInvestments sold under repurchase agreements continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position. Proceeds from the sale of the investments are reported as liabilities to either banks or customers. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is recognised over the period of the transaction and recorded as interest income or interest expense, using the effective interest rate method. If borrowed securities are sold to third parties, the proceeds from the sale and a liability for the obligation to return the collateral are recorded at fair value.\n\n|                                   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   | 31 December 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)              | Banks              | Customers          | Total              | Banks              | Customers          | Total              |\n| Assets                            |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements     | 3,181              | 6,733              | 9,914              | 3,209              | 7,801              | 11,010             |\n| Securities borrowing transactions | 2,973              | 3,251              | 6,225              | 3,266              | 2,448              | 5,715              |\n| Total                             | 6,154              | 9,984              | 16,138             | 6,475              | 10,249             | 16,725             |\n| Liabilities                       |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| Repurchase agreements             | 115                | 8,372              | 8,488              | 222                | 9,264              | 9,486              |\n| Securities lending transactions   | 4                  | 1,003              | 1,007              | 398                | 1,479              | 1,877              |\n| Total                             | 119                | 9,375              | 9,494              | 620                | 10,743             | 11,363             |",

ABN/uni00A0AMRO controls credit risk associated with these activities by monitoring counterparty credit exposure/uni00A0and collateral values on a daily basis and requiring additional collateral to be deposited with ABN/uni00A0AMRO when deemed/uni00A0necessary.\n\nThe total reverse repurchase agreements and total repurchase agreements decreased at the year-end by EUR/uni00A01.1/uni00A0billion and EUR/uni00A01.0/uni00A0billion, respectively, due to agreements with several large clients. Items of securities financing transactions that/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO can repledge or resell are included in Note 34 Transferred, pledged, encumbered and restricted assets.\n\n## 19  Fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value\n\n## Accounting policy for fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value is defined as the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid when transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nFor financial instruments that are actively traded and for which quoted market prices or market parameters are readily available, the fair value is determined in a highly objective manner. However, when observable market prices and parameters do not exist, management judgement is necessary to estimate fair value.\n\nFor financial instruments where no active liquid market exists, or quoted prices are unobtainable, recent market transactions are used or the fair value is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques - including reference to similar instruments for which market prices do exist, or to valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or option pricing models (e.g. Black Scholes).\n\nWhen portfolios of financial assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the net exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, any existing arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the counterparty) are taken into account./uni00A0\n\nUnobservable inputs are estimated using a combination of management judgement, historical data, market practice and benchmarking to other relevant observable market data. The difference between the transaction price and the internal valuation at inception, calculated using a model, is reserved and amortised to profit or loss at appropriate points over the life of the instrument, typically taking account of the ability to obtain reliable external data, the passage of time and the use of/uni00A0offsetting transactions. Where inputs to the valuation of a new transaction cannot be reliably determined, the transaction is initially recognised at its transaction price. Subsequent changes in fair value as calculated by the valuation model are reported as profit or loss or in equity.\n\nIn order to determine a reliable fair value, where appropriate, management applies valuation adjustments to the pricing information derived from the above sources. These adjustments reflect management's assessment of factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, to the extent that these factors have not already been included in the information from the above sources. The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are as follows:\n\n- \u00c5 Credit and debit valuation adjustments. In addition to credit valuation for loans measured at fair value through profit or loss, credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and how counterparties consider ABN/uni00A0AMRO's creditworthiness respectively;\n- \u00c5 Funding valuation adjustment. The funding valuation adjustment incorporates the incremental cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives;\n- \u00c5 Own credit adjustment. An own credit risk adjustment is applied to financial liabilities where it is believed that counterparties will consider ABN/uni00A0AMRO's creditworthiness when pricing such instruments;\n- \u00c5 Model valuation adjustments for any known limitations. Management assesses the appropriateness of any model used on an ongoing basis. To the extent that the price provided by internal models does not represent the fair value of the instrument, for instance in highly stressed market conditions, management makes adjustments to the model valuationto calibrate to other available pricing sources.\n\nWe believe our estimates of the fair value are adequate. However, the use of different models or assumptions could result in changes to our reported results.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Valuation control framework\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has designated controls and processes in place for determining the fair value of financial instruments. A process has been designed to ensure there are formalised review protocols for independent review and validation of fair values separate from those businesses entering into the transactions. This includes specific controls to ensure consistent pricing policies and procedures, incorporating disciplined price verification for both market and counterparty risk trades.\n\nThe business entering into the transaction is responsible for the initial determination and recording of the fair value of the\n\ntransaction. There are daily controls of the profit or loss recorded by trading and treasury front-office staff. A key element of the control environment, segregated from the recording of the transaction's valuation, is the independent price-verification process. Valuations are first calculated by the business. Such valuations may be current bid or offer prices in an active market, or may be derived using a model and variable model inputs. These valuations are reviewed and, if necessary, amended by the independent price-verification process. This process involves a team, independent of those trading the financial instruments, performing a review of valuations in the light of available pricing evidence. Independent price verification is frequently performed by matching the business valuations with independent data sources. For liquid instruments, the process is performed daily. The minimum frequency of review is monthly, both for trading positions and non-trading positions. The independent price-verification control includes formalised reporting and escalation to management of any valuation differences in breach of defined thresholds. When models are used to value products, those models are subject to a model review process. This process requires different levels of model documentation, testing and review, depending on the complexity of the model and the size of our exposure to the model.\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nA number of methodologies are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments for which observable prices in active markets for identical instruments are not available. Values between and beyond available data points are obtained by interpolation and/or extrapolation. When valuation techniques are used, the fair value can be significantly impacted by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions made concerning factors such as the amount and timing of cash flows, discount rates and credit risk.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nThis category includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, options and forward rate agreements. These products are valued by estimating future cash flows and discounting those cash flows, using appropriate interest rate curves. The exception is interest option contracts, which are valued using market standard option pricing models. The inputs for the discounting cash flow models are principally observable benchmark interest rates in active markets such as the interbank rates and quoted interest rates in the swap, bond and futures markets. The inputs for credit spreads - where available - are derived from prices of credit default swaps or other credit-based instruments, such as debt securities. In other cases, credit spreads are obtained from pricing services. The additional inputs for the option pricing models are price volatilities and correlations, which are obtained from broker quotations or pricing services or derived from option prices. Because of the observability of the inputs used in the valuation models, the majority of the interest rate derivative contracts are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, credit spreads, correlations or volatilities are based on significant unobservable inputs, the contracts are classified as level 3. Exchange traded options and futures are valued using quoted market prices and are hence classified as level 1.\n\n## Foreign exchange contracts\n\nForeign exchange contracts include foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange options and foreign exchange swaps. The majority of the foreign exchange contracts at ABN/uni00A0AMRO are traded as over-the-counter derivatives. These instruments are valued using foreign currency exchange rates. There are observable markets both for spot and forward contracts and for futures in the world's major currencies. The over-the-counter foreign exchange contracts are therefore classified as level 2.\n\n## Government debt securities\n\nGovernment debt securities consist of government bonds and bills with fixed or floating rate interest payments issued by sovereign governments. These instruments are generally traded in active markets and prices can be derived directly from those markets. Therefore the instruments are classified as level 1. Highly liquid bonds are valued using exchange traded prices. Less liquid bonds are valued using observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services. For a minority of the government debt securities, active market prices are not available. In these cases ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses discounted cash flow valuation techniques that incorporate observable market data for similar government instruments. The main inputs are interest rate curves, liquidity spreads and credit spreads. The",

If adjustments to any of the main inputs are made based on significant unobservable inputs, the instrument is classified as level 3.\n\n## Corporate debt securities\n\nCorporate debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds and other debt securities issued by corporate entities. Most of these instruments are standard fixed or floating rate securities. Corporate debt securities are generally valued using observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services. These instruments are classified as level 1. If observable market prices are not available, ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses discounted cash flow valuation techniques, based on inputs derived from comparable instruments and credit default swap data of the issuer, to estimate credit spreads. These instruments are classified as level 2.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nEquity instruments that are actively traded on public stock exchanges are valued using the readily available quoted prices and are therefore classified as level 1. Investments in private equity funds are initially recognised at their transaction price and remeasured to the extent reliable information is available on a case-by-case basis and are classified as level 3.\n\n## Loans and advances at fair value through profit or loss\n\nLoans and advances at fair value through profit or loss primarily consist of contracts with corporate clients where the contractual cash flows do not meet the SPPI requirements. The return on these contracts with embedded derivatives is based on the price of underlying commodity contracts or loans with a floating interest rate. Discounted cash flow models/uni00A0are used to value these contracts. The main inputs are interest rate curves, quoted commodity prices, liquidity spreads and credit spreads. The instruments are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, liquidity spreads and credit spreads are based on significant unobservable inputs, the instruments are classified as level 3.\n\n## Issued debt\n\nIssued debt securities are valued using discounted cash flow models, based on current interest rate curves that incorporate observable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 2. When there are no, or only limited, publicly quoted prices available for these instruments and unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the fair value calculation, these instruments are classified as level 3.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO refines and modifies its valuation techniques as markets and products develop and as the pricing for individual products becomes more or less readily available. While ABN/uni00A0AMRO believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could result in different/uni00A0estimates of the fair value at the reporting date.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO analyses financial instruments held at fair value in the three categories described below.\n\nLevel 1 financial instruments are those that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.\n\nLevel 2 financial instruments are those valued using techniques based primarily on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued using quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets that are not considered to be active, or using valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments are those valued using a valuation technique where at least one input with a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. The effect of fair value adjustments on the instrument's valuation is included in the assessment.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change occurred.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

The sensitivity analysis is performed using a range of reasonable valuation spreads.\n\n## Interest-earning securities - other\n\nPreferrence shares are shares for which the dividend is fixed for a period of ten years, after which the dividend is redetermined, and the shares can also be redeemed. The position is valued using a discounted cash flow model for which the relevant inputs are the interest curve, liquidity spread and credit spread. The liquidity spread and credit spread are unobservable inputs and are derived from similar securities. The sensitivity of the preferrence shares is determined by using a range of reasonable spreads and by considering the call option that is held by the issuer.\n\n## Equity shares - Preferred shares\n\nEquities measured at fair value through profit and loss and classified as level 3 mainly comprise private equity investments. Private equity shares are measured at fair value, with two calculation techniques being applied:\n\n- H Using comparable pricing in accordance with the European Private Equity and Venture Capitalist Association (EVCA) guidelines. This valuation technique is based on earnings multiples of comparable listed and unlisted companies. The fair value calculation of an investment is strongly linked with movements on the public equity markets;\n- H Net Asset Value (NAV) for fund investments and asset-backed investments. This is determined by using audited and unaudited company financial statements and any other information available, publicly or otherwise. As a consequence, the net asset value calculation of an investment is strongly linked to movements in the quarterly performance of the company and can be used as an indicator of fair value.\n\nNew investments are initially valued at fair value. Subsequently, the fair value technique, either EVCA technique or NAV calculation, is applied for direct investments.\n\nThe sensitivity for using comparable pricing is determined by stressing the earnings multiples in a positive and negative market scenario, whereas sensitivity testing for the NAV calculation based upon the quarterly performance cannot be applied.",

For counterparties that do not have an observable credit spread, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies a proxied credit spread extracted from counterparties of comparable credit quality that do have an observable credit spread. ABN/uni00A0AMRO performs a probability of default assessment for each counterparty and allocates an appropriate internal credit risk measure known as a Uniform Counterparty Rating (UCR).This UCR, which is significant to the entire fair value measurement of the derivative contracts included in the following table of level 3 sensitivity information, is internally generated and is therefore an unobservable input.\n\n|                                                  | Valuation   technique     | Unobservable  data           | Carrying  value   | Possible alternative  assumptions   | Possible alternative  assumptions   | Unobservable   data range   | Unobservable   data range   | Unobservable  data base   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                             |                           |                              |                   | Applying  minimum                   | Applying  maximum                   | Applying  minimum           | Applying  maximum           |                           |\n| 31 December 2021                                 |                           |                              |                   |                                     |                                     |                             |                             |                           |\n| Equity shares                                    | Private equity  valuation | EBITDA  multiples            | 159               | -16                                 | 16                                  |                             |                             |                           |\n| Equity shares                                    | Private equity  valuation | Net asset  value             | 274               | -27                                 | 27                                  |                             |                             |                           |\n| Interest-earning securities -

This was partly offset by modest declines in consumer loans and corporate loans. Higher collateral and default fund contributions for Clearing clients were the main contributor to the increase in other loans and advances.\n\nFor information on loan impairment allowances, please refer to the Credit risk review section in the Risk, funding & capital chapter.\n\n## 22  Fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value\n\n## Accounting policy for fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value\n\nThe categorisation and valuation of financial instruments not carried at fair value is determined in accordance with/uni00A0the accounting policies set out in Note 19 Fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. Note that the fair value can be significantly impacted by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions concerning factors such as the amount and timing of cash flows, discount rates, credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\n## Short-term financial instruments\n\nThe carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) of financial instruments maturing within a period of less than three months or that have no contractual maturity are assumed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value. For certain instruments, behavioural maturities are applied./uni00A0\n\nShort-term financial instruments are classified as level 2 because unobservable inputs (such as inputs to determine credit risk, prepayment risk and liquidity risk) do not have a significant influence in determining the fair value.\n\n## Cash and balances at central banks\n\nCash and balances at central banks are classified as level 1 because these instruments have a short-term nature, prices from an active market are available and no fair value adjustments are made to the carrying amounts./uni00A0\n\n## Securities financing\n\nSecurities financing includes repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments and the value and liquidity of available collateral, the carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) are considered to approximate the fair value. Securities financing amounts are classified as level 2.\n\n## Loans and advances/uni00A0banks and customers\n\nThe fair value of loans and advances banks and customers is estimated by a discounted cash flow model based on contractual cash flows, using actual yields and discounting by risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes in liquidity spreads are applied and prepayment options are included in the estimated fair value. The calculations are adjusted for credit risk by incorporating the expected credit losses over the estimated lifetime of the loan, based on parameters including probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The loans and advances are classified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly influence the approximated fair values. The loans and advances for which unobservable inputs do not significantly influence the approximated fair values are classified as level 2. Behavioural maturities instead of contractual maturities are used to determine the level classification of a small part of the portfolio.\n\nCash collateral paid to counterparties in relation to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) is included in loans and advances banks and customers. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments, fair value is considered to approximate the carrying amounts. The related amounts are classified as level 2.\n\n## Due to banks and customers\n\nThe fair value of instruments such as deposits and borrowings included in due to banks and customers is estimated by a discounted cash flow model based on risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes in liquidity spreads are applied. Amounts due to banks and customers are classified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly influence the approximated fair values. The financial instruments for which unobservable inputs do not significantly influence the approximated fair values are classified as level 2. For the majority of the portfolio, behavioural maturities are used to determine the level classification.\n\nCash collateral liabilities in relation to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) are included in due to banks and customers. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments, fair value is considered to approximate the carrying amounts. The related amounts are classified as level 2.\n\n## Issued debt and subordinated liabilities\n\nThe fair value of issued debt securities and subordinated liabilities is based on quoted prices. If these are not available, the fair value is based on a market approach in which independent quotes from market participants are used for the debt issuance spreads above the average interbank offered rates (over a range of tenors) that the market would demand when purchasing new senior or subordinated debt from ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Where necessary, these quotes are interpolated, using a curve shape derived from CDS prices.",

structure\n\n## Accounting policy for business combinations\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the bank. All items of consideration, including contingent consideration, transferred by ABN/uni00A0AMRO are measured and recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Transaction costs incurred by ABN/uni00A0AMRO in connection with the business combination, other than those associated with the issuance of debt and equity securities, do not form part of the cost of the business combination transaction but are expensed as incurred. The excess of the purchase consideration over ABN/uni00A0AMRO's share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired (including certain contingent liabilities) is recorded as goodwill.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO measures the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the fair value at the acquisition date. In a step acquisition, where a business combination occurs in stages and control of the business is obtained in stages, the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are recognised at fair value when control is obtained. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss as the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquiree and",

Changes in interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a change of control are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity.\n\n## Accounting policy for subsidiaries\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's subsidiaries are those entities which it directly or indirectly controls. Control over an entity is evidenced by ABN/uni00A0AMRO's ability to exercise its power in order to affect the variable returns that it is exposed to through its involvement in the entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account when assessing whether control exists.\n\nThe assessment of control is based on consideration of all facts and circumstances. The bank reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control (power, exposure to variability in returns, and a link between the two).\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO sponsors entities, including certain special purpose entities, which may or may not be directly owned, for the purpose of asset securitisation transactions and other specific and well-defined objectives. Particularly in the case of securitisations, these entities may acquire assets from ABN/uni00A0AMRO companies. Some of these entities hold assets that are not available to meet the claims of creditors of ABN/uni00A0AMRO or its subsidiaries. These entities are consolidated in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's financial statements when the substance of the relationship between ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the entity indicates that control is held by ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is mainly involved in securitisations of own originated assets, such as various consumer and commercial financial assets. This process generally necessitates a sale of these assets to a special purpose entity (SPE), which in turn issues securities to investors. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's interests in securitised assets may be retained in the form of senior or subordinated tranches, issued guarantees, interest-only strips or other residual interests, together referred to as retained interests. In many cases, these retained interests convey control, such that the SPE is consolidated and the securitised assets continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries and special purpose entities are included in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\n\n## Accounting policy for associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are those entities in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO has significant influence on, but no control or joint control over, the operating and financial policies. Significant influence is generally presumed when ABN/uni00A0AMRO holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered in assessing whether ABN/uni00A0AMRO has significant influence. Among other factors, representation on the board of directors, participation in the policymaking/uni00A0process and material transactions between the entity and the investee are considered to determine significant influence.\n\nA joint venture is an investment in which two or more parties have contractually agreed to share control over the investment. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The activities conducted through joint ventures include cash transfers, insurance, finance and leasing.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures, including strategic investments, are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently increased (or decreased) for post-acquisition net income (or loss), other movements impacting on the equity of the investee and any adjustments required for impairment. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognised in Share of result in equity accounted investements. If ABN/uni00A0AMRO's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying amount is reduced to zero, including any other unsecured receivables, and recognition of further losses is discontinued except if ABN/uni00A0AMRO has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\n## Assets and liabilities of acquisitions and divestments\n\nThe following table provides details of the assets and liabilities resulting from the acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries and equity accounted investments at the date of acquisition or disposal.",

ABN AMRO is involved with structured entities through securitisation of financial assets and investments in structured entities. Structured entities generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are collateralised/uni00A0by the assets held by the structured entities. The debt and equity securities issued by the structured entities may include/uni00A0tranches with/uni00A0varying levels of subordination.The interest in unconsolidated structured entities decreased by EUR 65 million to EUR/uni00A04.2/uni00A0billion at year-end 2021 (31 december 2020: EUR 4.3 billion). The interests consist mainly of debt securities in corporate loans of/uni00A0EUR 677 million (31 december 2020: EUR 414 million) and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities recognised under financial investments of EUR 3.2 billion (31 december 2020: EUR 3.5 billion). The maximum exposure to losses from these interests is equal to the/uni00A0total carrying amount.\n\n## Sponsoring of unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAn entity is considered a sponsor of an unconsolidated structured entity if it had a key role in establishing that entity so that the transaction that is the purpose of the entity could occur.

At each balance sheet date, an assessment is performed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in an enhancement to the asset. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment, and of major components that are accounted for separately. ABN/uni00A0AMRO generally uses the following useful lives in calculating depreciation:\n\n- \u00c5 Land: not depreciated;\n- \u00c5 Buildings: 30 years;\n- \u00c5 Leasehold improvements: 5 years;\n- \u00c5 Equipment: 5 years;\n- \u00c5 Installations (durable): 10 years;\n- \u00c5 Computer installations: 2 to 5 years.\n\nAt each reporting date, ABN/uni00A0AMRO reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (i.e. ROU assets, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication/uni00A0exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.\n\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-generating units. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. In general, ABN/uni00A0AMRO's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are used by more than one cashgenerating unit. Corporate assets are allocated to cash-generating units on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the cash-generating unit to which the corporate assets are allocated.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in profit or loss under depreciation and amortisation expenses. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the cash-generating unit on a pro rata basis.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in the income statement as a component of depreciation and amortisation expense. Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had previously been recognised.\n\nDepreciation rates and residual values are reviewed at least periodically to take into account any change in circumstances. Capitalised leasehold improvements are depreciated in a manner that takes into account the term and renewal conditions of/uni00A0the related lease.\n\nAssets for which the bank acts as a lessor in an operational lease contract are included in property and equipment. The/uni00A0asset/uni00A0is depreciated on a straight-line basis, over its useful life, to its estimated residual value.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policy for leases\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nWhere ABN/uni00A0AMRO acts as lessor, a distinction is made between operating and finance leases. Leases where the bank transfers substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. Leases that do not transfer these risks and rewards are classified as operating leases. Finance leases are recognised as a receivable in loans and advances at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease, less credit loss allowances. Assets subject to operating leases are recognised at cost in property and equipment. Operating income from finance leases is recognised in a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\n## Lessee accounting\n\nAll leases, except for low-value leases and leases with a duration of less than one year, are recognised on the balance sheet as a right of use (ROU) asset and lease liability. As a lessee, ABN/uni00A0AMRO enters into various lease contracts, mainly for office buildings and cars that the bank leases for its own use. When accounting for the contracts as a lessee, ABN/uni00A0AMRO separates non-lease components from lease components. Payments such as variable lease payments and non-lease components are not included in the lease liability. The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which reflects the initial lease liability, adjusted for upfront lease payments, received incentives and initial direct costs. The initial lease liability is equal to the sum of the fixed lease payments, discounted by the incremental borrowing rate\n\nThe ROU asset is depreciated over the period of the lease, using the straight-line method.\n\nAdjustments to the ROU asset and corresponding lease liability result from remeasurement and/or modification. Remeasurement occurs when there is a change in the lease term or discount rate, or when ABN/uni00A0AMRO changes its assessment regarding purchase, extension or termination options. A lease modification is a change in the scope of the lease, or the consideration of a part of a lease that was not in the original terms and conditions of the lease. A lease modification results in either a separate additional lease or a change in the accounting for the existing lease. In the case of a lease modification not resulting in an additional lease, the lease liability is remeasured by adjusting the carrying amount of the ROU asset and, to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease, recognising any gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nExpenses related to short-term leases with a term of less than 12 months and leases of low-value are recognised in the income statement. ROU assets are included in the line item Property and equipment, while the lease liabilities are included in Other liabilities. Depreciation of the ROU assets is included in the line item for depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible assets in the income statement, and interest expense on lease liabilities is included in the line item Other interest and similar expense.\n\n## Sale and leaseback transactions\n\nIn a sale and leaseback transaction, the seller-lessee transfers an underlying asset to the buyer-lessor and leases that asset back from the buyer-lessor.\n\n## Seller-lessee accounting\n\nIf the bank is involved in a sale and leaseback transaction as a seller-lessee, the accounting policy described below is from the perspective of a seller-lessee. To determine how to account for a sale and leaseback transaction, the bank first considers whether the initial transfer of the underlying asset from the seller-lessee to the buyer-lessor is a sale in accordance with IFRS/uni00A015./uni00A0\n\nIf a sale and leaseback transaction results in a sale in accordance with IFRS 15, the underlying asset is derecognised and the lessee accounting model is applied to the leaseback.The ROU asset arising from the leaseback is measured based on the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the rights of use retained by the seller-lessee. Accordingly, any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor is recognised.\n\nThe proportion of the rights of use retained is the ratio between the present value of lease payments at market rates (excluding any future index changes) and the fair value of the consideration for the sale proceeds. The residual proportion is the proportion of the rights transferred.\n\nThe fair value of the consideration for the sale proceeds is equal to the fair value of the underlying asset in the sale-andleaseback transaction. If this does not equal the fair value of the underlying asset, or if the payments for the/uni00A0lease/uni00A0are not at market rates, the bank makes adjustments to recognise the sale proceeds at the fair value. Any below-market terms are recognised as a prepayment of/uni00A0lease payments and any above-market terms are recognised as additional financing provided by the buyer-lessor/uni00A0to the seller-lessee.",

For the purpose of calculating goodwill, the fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. Goodwill is not amortised, but is/uni00A0reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred. In the test, the carrying amount of goodwill is compared with the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use, being the present value of the cash flows discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risk of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement as depreciation and amortisation expense and are irreversible.\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nThe accounting policy for software and other intangible assets is determined by IAS 38 Intangible assets. Software is amortised over a period of three years, unless it is classified as core application software, which is depreciated over its estimated useful life, set at a maximum of seven years. Only the development phase is capitalised for own-developed software.\n\nOther intangible assets include separately identifiable items arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries, such as customer relationships, and certain purchased trademarks and similar items. In general, the estimated useful life does not exceed ten years. Amortisation rates and residual values are reviewed at least annually to take into account any change in circumstances.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                    | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Land and buildings held for own use     | 211                | 242                |\n| Leasehold improvements                  | 43                 | 48                 |\n| Plant & equipment under operating lease | 533                | 602                |\n| Equipment                               | 84                 | 116                |\n| Right of use assets                     | 299                | 246                |\n| Total property and equipment            | 1,172              | 1,255              |\n\nTotal property and equipment decreased by EUR/uni00A00.1/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A01.2/uni00A0billion at 31 December 2021.

estimated at EUR/uni00A0283/uni00A0million (31 december 2020: EUR/uni00A0845/uni00A0million). Of this fair value, 100% is based on external valuations performed in 2017 to 2021. Some properties have a/uni00A0lower fair value than the recorded carrying value. No impairment is recorded because these properties are considered corporate assets. The value in use for the cash-generating units within ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank is sufficient to cover the total value of all these assets.",

Leases\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO enters into leases both as lessor and as lessee. In its capacity as lessee, ABN/uni00A0AMRO leases various assets, mainly office properties, cars and equipment that serve to support the bank's operations. The leases have various terms and termination and renewal options. The majority of termination and renewal options are exercisable only by the bank and not by/uni00A0the respective lessor. There are no variable lease payments in lease contracts where ABN/uni00A0AMRO acts as lessee. No/uni00A0covenants are present in the lease agreements and ABN/uni00A0AMRO is not allowed to use leased assets as security for financing purposes. The total cash outflow relating to leases in 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A091/uni00A0million (31 december 2020: EUR/uni00A0105/uni00A0million)./uni00A0\n\n## Sale and leaseback of head office at Gustav Mahlerlaan\n\nIn 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO completed the sale and leaseback of its head office at Gustav Mahlerlaan in Amsterdam. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is the seller-lessee in this transaction. The buyer-lessor of the office paid a total consideration of EUR/uni00A0765/uni00A0million. As part of the sale, ABN/uni00A0AMRO recognised a pre-tax gain of EUR/uni00A0327/uni00A0million (EUR/uni00A0245/uni00A0million net of tax) in other operating income (Note 6 Net income from other operating activities). As part of the lease, ABN/uni00A0AMRO recognised a RoU asset of EUR/uni00A078/uni00A0million and a corresponding lease liability of EUR/uni00A0203/uni00A0million (Note 32 Other liabilities).\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO will lease back the Gustav Mahlerlaan office for a period of four years before moving to the redeveloped office building at Foppingadreef in Amsterdam Zuidoost. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has an option, which is only exercisable by ABN/uni00A0AMRO, to/uni00A0extend the lease by a further period of one year.",

Exercising this option will result in an additional gain of approximately EUR/uni00A015/uni00A0million.\n\nIn the first four years, the lease is based on 'triple net' conditions, which means that the share of the owner's maintenance\n\ncosts normally incurred by the lessor will be paid by the lessee. The contractual lease amounts are paid quarterly in advance. The office building at Foppingadreef is currently being/uni00A0redeveloped and work is expected to be completed in mid-2025. After/uni00A02025, ABN/uni00A0AMRO will continue to lease a small part of the Gustav Mahlerlaan office, which will remain the bank's head office for an additional fifteen years, with the option to extend this period by five years. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is also financing part of/uni00A0the sale and leaseback transaction for the next four years.\n\nThe following table shows the maturity of lease liabilities for leases in which the bank acts as lessee, as well as the future undiscounted minimum lease receipts under operating and financial leases where the bank acts as lessor. It also reconciles the total future minimum lease receipts under financial leases and the net investment in the leases.\n\n|                                                       | 31 December 2021        | 31 December 2021                              | 31 December 2021                             | 31 December 2021    | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021          | 31 December 2021               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                  | Within  3/uni00A0months | More than  3/uni00A0months but  within 1 year | More than  1/uni00A0year but  within 5 years | More than   5 years | Total              | Unearned  finance  income | Net  investment  in  the lease |\n| Lease liabilities                                     | 15                      | 44                                            | 174                                          | 88                  | 320                | n/a                       | n/a                            |\n| Future minimum lease receipts  under financial leases | 771                     | 1,124                                         | 2,882                                        | 446                 | 5,222              | -250                      | 4,972                          |\n| Future minimum lease receipts  under operating leases | 42                      | 135                                           | 369                                          | 37                  | 583                | n/a                       | n/a                            |\n|                                                       |                         |                                               |                                              |                     |                    | 31 December 2020          | 31 December 2020               |\n| Lease liabilities                                     | 17                      | 49                                            | 179                                          | 111                 | 355                | n/a                       | n/a                            |\n| Future minimum lease receipts  under financial leases |                         |                                               |                                              |                     |                    |                           |                                |\n|                                                       | 1,220                   | 1,237                                         | 3,042                                        | 535                 | 6,034              | -300                      | 5,734                          |\n| Future minimum lease receipts                         |                         |                                               |                                              |                     |                    |                           |                                |\n| under operating leases                                | 54                      | 138                                           | 421                                          | 46                  | 660                | n/a                       | n/a                            |\n\nIn its capacity as lessor, ABN/uni00A0AMRO leases out various assets.

Assets held for sale (other than financial instruments) are not depreciated and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value, less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities of a business held for sale are presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                    | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Assets                                  |                    |                    |\n| Financial investments                   | 86                 |                    |\n| Property and equipment                  | 3                  | 254                |\n| Assets of businesses held for sale      | 89                 | 254                |\n| Liabilities                             |                    |                    |\n| Liabilities of businesses held for sale |                    |                    |\n\n1",

        "page_content": "The 2021 held for sale position of EUR/uni00A089/uni00A0million consists mainly of financial investments and is attributable to the equity stake in Tink and a few other small investments. During the year the head office building was sold. The sale is part of a sale and leaseback transaction with the buyer-lessor of the building. The property was measured at the carrying amount, which was significantly lower than the fair value (less cost to sell).\n\n## 26  Other assets\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)              | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Accrued other income              | 564                | 575                |\n| Prepaid expenses                  | 25                 | 31                 |\n| Unsettled securities transactions | 1,046              | 1,521              |\n| Trade and other receivables       | 2,284              | 2,292              |\n| Other                             | 345                | 505                |\n| Total other assets                | 4,263              | 4,925              |\n\nThe decrease of EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion in other assets was mainly driven by a EUR/uni00A00.5/uni00A0billion decrease in unsettled securities transactions and EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion in other.\n\nUnsettled securities transactions are related to reversed repurchase and securities borrowing transactions that are delivered but not settled. The decrease was mainly related to the clearing business that is fully based on the nature of the business to supply in the needs of their clients' financing strategies and related transactions to be settled.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, other assets included a net receivable of EUR/uni00A00.1/uni00A0billion related to the bankruptcy of DSB Bank (31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion).\n\n## 27  Due to banks\n\n## Accounting policy for due to banks and due to customers\n\nAmounts due to banks and customers are held at amortised cost.

This increase was partly offset by matured interbank deposits of EUR/uni00A01.0/uni00A0billion and periodic current account balances with credit institutions of EUR/uni00A00.4/uni00A0billion.\n\nABN AMRO participates in the targeted longer-term refinancing operations III (TLTRO III) for an amount of EUR 35.0 billion, of which EUR 32.0 billion was drawn in June 2020 and EUR 3.0 billion in June 2021. The funding has a quarterly repayment option. TLTRO III offers ABN AMRO funding at attractive conditions. A guaranteed interest rate discount of 50bps applies to the interest rate period from 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2022. An additional interest rate discount of 50bps over the remaining interest period can be achieved if specific targets linked to the issuance of new loans to non-financial corporations and households are met. The TLTRO III funding is accounted for at amortised cost, with an effective interest rate equal to the Main Refinancing Operations rate. The discounts, both conditional and unconditional, are accounted for as government grants and recognised in interest income. As at the year-end, there was a reasonable expectation that the conditions/uni00A0applicable for the additional discount were met./uni00A0As a result, a catch-up adjustment was made to recognise the additional 50 basis points discount in interest income.",

Hybrid or structured financial liabilities are irrevocably designated upon initial recognition to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. The latter is applied when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch, are managed on the basis of their fair value or include terms that qualify as an embedded derivative that cannot be separated.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation to determine whether funding is a financial liability or equity. Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as financial liabilities where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in ABN/uni00A0AMRO having a present obligation to deliver either cash or another financial asset or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed number of equity shares.\n\nIssued liabilities qualify as subordinated debt if claims by the holders are subordinated to all other current and future liabilities of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe valuation of liabilities measured at fair value includes the effect of changes in the bank's own credit spreads. The change in fair value applies to those financial liabilities designated at fair value where own value credit risk would be considered by market participants. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk of issued debt is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity. Exchange-traded own debt measured at fair value through profit or loss is valued at market prices.\n\nFair value changes are calculated based on a yield curve generated from observed external pricing for funding and quoted CDS spreads\n\n1",

No perpetual loans were recorded at the reporting date. The issued and outstanding loans qualifying as subordinated liabilities are subordinated to all other current and future liabilities.\n\n## 30 Provisions\n\n## Accounting policy for provisions\n\nA provision is recognised in the balance sheet when ABN/uni00A0AMRO has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect of time value is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market rates and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognised when an obligation exists. An obligation exists when ABN/uni00A0AMRO has approved a detailed plan and has raised a valid expectation in those affected by the plan by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features. Future operating costs are not provided for. Provisions for insurance risks are determined by actuarial methods, which include the use of statistics, interest rate data and settlement cost expectations.\n\nProvisions are established for certain guarantee contracts for which ABN/uni00A0AMRO is liable to pay upon default of payment. Expected credit loss allowances of loan commitments and financial guarantees are recognised as provisions under IFRS 9.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)              | 31 December 2021   |   31 December 2020 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Insurance fund liabilities        | 5                  |                 11 |\n| Provision for pension commitments | 79                 |                106 |\n| Restructuring provision           | 178                |                226 |\n| Other staff provision             | 137                |                136 |\n| Legal provisions                  | 398                |                 98 |\n| Credit commitments provisions     | 222                |                 92 |\n| Other provisions                  | 181                |                258 |\n| Total provisions                  | 1,201              |                926 |\n\n## Insurance fund liabilities\n\nInsurance fund liabilities include the insurance companies' actuarial reserves, premium and claims reserves.

In the second quarter of 2015, ABN/uni00A0AMRO first recognised a/uni00A0provision for compensating clients who had been disadvantaged in this respect and suffered loss or damage./uni00A0\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has set up its own client reassessment process and the related checks and balances with respect to the Uniform Recovery Framework devised by a committee of independent experts ('the Committee') appointed by the Dutch Minister of Finance. In the first quarter of 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO finalised the process of sending all clients a letter containing the outcome of the reassessment. At various points in the process, the reassessments were checked by an independent external file reviewer (in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's case, by the audit firm PwC), supervised by the AFM. Except for a limited number of/uni00A0proceedings relating to the Uniform Recovery Framework before the local courts, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has completed the execution of the Uniform Recovery Framework. The total provision for SME derivatives-related issues amounted to EUR/uni00A06/uni00A0million at 31/uni00A0December 2021. This comprised the total amount of client compensation (EUR/uni00A00.6/uni00A0billion) and project costs (EUR/uni00A00.3/uni00A0billion), after payments already made for both elements (EUR/uni00A00.8/uni00A0billion).\n\n## EURIBOR-based mortgages\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has sold mortgage loans with floating, often EURIBOR-based, interest rates to consumers. These rates include a/uni00A0margin charge. Under the applicable terms and conditions, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has the right to unilaterally adjust the margin charge. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's decision to increase the margin charge in 2012 resulted in two class actions, on top of multiple individual cases, being instigated. The central question in these cases is whether ABN/uni00A0AMRO's right in the terms and conditions to unilaterally adjust the margin charge is an unfair contractual clause.\n\nOn 22 November 2019, the Supreme Court quashed the ruling of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in the EURIBOR collective cases. The case has been referred to another Court of Appeal (The Hague) whereby the Court will need to take all relevant aspects into account to judge if the clauses are unfair. The hearing in this matter took place on 9 November 2021 and the Court of Appeal expects to give its verdict on 15 March 2022./uni00A0\n\nOn 13 February 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the foundation Stichting Euribar reached an agreement on a settlement for clients with/uni00A0EURIBOR-Woninghypotheek mortgages. Key points of the agreement are compensation for the past and certainty for the future EURIBOR margin charge. By June 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO sent out the settlement offers to all known eligible clients, of/uni00A0which 81% have accepted as per 31 December 2021. The other foundation, Stichting Stop de Banken, broke off the negotiations aimed at reaching an agreement and announced it will proceed with the class action as mentioned above./uni00A0\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has recognised a provision for the EURIBOR-based mortgage cases.\n\n## Variable interest rates for consumer loans\n\nOn 3 March 2021, the Kifid Appeals Committee confirmed a ruling of the Kifid Disputes Committee about the recalculation of/uni00A0the variable interest charged to a specific client on a revolving credit. In short, Kifid ruled that ABN/uni00A0AMRO should have followed the market rate while establishing the variable interest rate for certain revolving consumer credits./uni00A0\n\nIn light of the Kifid ruling, ABN/uni00A0AMRO reached agreement/uni00A0with the Dutch Consumers' Association (Consumentenbond Claimservice) on 5 September 2021 regarding a compensation scheme for affected clients. The/uni00A0compensation scheme entailed a proactive recalculation of variable interest charged as from 1 January 2008 on various revolving consumer credits offered by ABN/uni00A0AMRO, ALFAM and ICS. In Q4 of 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has decided to (where possible and applicable) proactively recalculate variable interest charged as from 1 January 2001. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has provisioned around EUR/uni00A0348/uni00A0million for the interest to be compensated and/uni00A0the costs incurred in/uni00A0carrying out the scheme./uni00A0During the year EUR/uni00A09/uni00A0million of this provision has been used. The remaining provision as per 31 December 2021 is EUR/uni00A0338/uni00A0million.",

Recent rulings from Kifid regarding other credit providers (in relation to mortgage loans) suggest that Kifid envisages a broad scope. ABN AMRO cannot give a reliable estimate of the (potentially substantial) financial risk of these contingent liabilities not provided for.\n\n## Credit commitments provisions\n\nCredit commitment provisions increased mainly due to a FR&R case.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions decreased mainly due to the usage of 'Know Your Client' provision.\n\n## AML remediation programme\n\nTo address shortcomings, as well/uni00A0as increasingly strict regulations and continuously evolving forms of financial crime, ABN/uni00A0AMRO had already started an/uni00A0extensive bank-wide AML remediation programme. In 2021, the remediation of client files has progressed. The total provision regarding the AML programme amounted to EUR/uni00A066/uni00A0million at 31 December 2021.\n\n## AML settlement\n\nIn April 2021, ABN/uni00A0AMRO accepted a settlement offer from the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service in connection with its investigation of the bank's AML activities in the Netherlands over the period 2014-2020. ABN/uni00A0AMRO agreed to pay a fine of EUR/uni00A0300/uni00A0million and a disgorgement of EUR/uni00A0180/uni00A0million. The total amount of EUR/uni00A0480/uni00A0million has been recorded in other expenses at Group Functions in Q1 2021 and has therefore no further impact on past or present provisions. ABN AMRO was/uni00A0informed that an individual filed a complaint against the AML settlement between the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service and ABN AMRO under section 12 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure with the Court of Appeal in The Hague.

These schemes are mainly defined contribution plans. The majority of the beneficiaries of the plans are located in the Netherlands.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, ABN/uni00A0AMRO pays annual contributions determined by a fixed method and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay any further contributions. Contributions are recognised directly in the income statement in the year to which they relate. Actuarial and investment risk are for the account of the participants in the plan.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Defined benefit plans\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the net obligation of each plan is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligations and the fair value of the plan's assets.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used for calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligations include discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds, the inflation rate, future salary increases, employee contributions, mortality assumptions and rates of employee turnover. The assumptions are based on available market data and management expectations at the end of the reporting period.\n\nPlan assets are measured at fair value at balance sheet date and are netted against the defined benefit obligations. Pension costs recognised in the income statement for defined benefit plans consist of:\n\n- \u00c5 service costs;\n- \u00c5 net interest costs determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the discount rate, both as at the start of the annual reporting period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments; and\n- \u00c5 curtailments or plan amendments.\n\nDifferences between pension costs and pension contributions payable are accounted for as provisions or prepayments.\n\n## Remeasurement\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) are actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments (i.e. unexpectedly high or low rates of employee turnover). They are recognised in/uni00A0other comprehensive income and are not recycled to profit or loss in later periods. The actual return on the pension plan's assets is determined after deduction of the costs of managing the assets and any tax payable by the pension plan itself.\n\n## Other employee benefits\n\nSome group companies provide post-retirement benefits to their retirees, such as long-term service benefits and discounts on banking products. Entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.\n\nThe expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment, using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. These obligations are calculated annually.\n\nPlans in all countries comply with applicable local regulations concerning investments and minimum funding levels.\n\n## Pension and other employee/uni00A0benefits\n\nAmounts recognised in the income statement for pensions and other/uni00A0employee benefits\n\n|                                                                     | 2021                              | 2021                      | 2021   | 2020                              | 2020                      | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                | Defined post  employment  benefit | Other  employee  benefits | Total  | Defined post  employment  benefit | Other  employee  benefits | Total  |\n| Current service cost                                                | 7                                 | 11                        | 18     | 6                                 | 21                        | 27     |\n| Interest cost                                                       | 1                                 |                           | 2      | 2                                 |                           | 2      |\n| Interest income                                                     | -1                                |                           | -1     | -1                                |                           | -1     |\n| Other                                                               |                                   | -3                        | -3     | -1                                | 2                         | 1      |\n| Total defined benefit expenses in actuarial report                  | 7                                 | 8                         | 15     | 6                                 | 23                        | 29     |\n| Other expenses                                                      | -4                                |                           | -4     | -5                                |                           | -5     |\n| Total defined benefit expenses                                      | 3                                 | 8                         | 11     | 1                                 | 23                        | 24     |\n| Defined contribution plans                                          | 291                               |                           | 291    | 306                               |                           | 306    |\n| Total pension expenses and other post retirement  employee benefits | 294                               | 8                         | 302    | 307                               | 23                        | 330    |\n\nTotal pension and other employee benefits expenses decreased by EUR/uni00A028/uni00A0million.

Please refer to Note 1 Accounting policies.\n\nPledged assets are assets pledged as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities and the terms and conditions relating to/uni00A0the pledge. Encumbered assets are those that are pledged or other assets that we believe to be restricted in order to secure, credit-enhance or collateralise a transaction.\n\nIn principle, pledged assets are encumbered assets. The following differences apply to ABN/uni00A0AMRO:\n\n- \u00c5 Encumbered assets include mandatory reserve requirements with central banks;\n- \u00c5 Encumbered assets exclude assets pledged for unused credit facilities with central banks at the statement of/uni00A0financialposition date, i.e. mainly retained mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSignificant restrictions on assets may arise from statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements such as:\n\n- \u00c5 Those that restrict the ability of the parent or its subsidiaries to transfer cash or other financial assets to or from other entities within the group;\n- \u00c5 Guarantees or other requirements that may restrict dividends and other capital distributions being paid, or loans and advances being made or repaid to other entities within the group;\n- \u00c5 Protective rights of other non-controlling interests that may restrict the ability of the bank to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within the group and to settle liabilities of the bank.\n\n## Transferred financial assets\n\nThis disclosure provides insight into the relationship between these transferred financial assets and associated financial liabilities in order to show the risks the bank is exposed to when the assets are transferred. If transferred financial assets continue to be recognised in the balance sheet, ABN/uni00A0AMRO is still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\n## Transferred financial assets not derecognised in their entirety\n\nThe following table shows transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety.",

In/uni00A0a/uni00A0securitisation transaction utilising true sale mechanics, the bank transfers the title of the assets to SPEs. When the cash/uni00A0flows are transferred to investors in the notes issued by consolidated securitisation vehicles, the assets (mainly residential mortgage loans) are considered to be transferred. The bank had no transferred and associated securitisations at/uni00A031/uni00A0December 2021.\n\n## Securities financing\n\nSecurities financing transactions are entered into on a collateralised basis for mitigating the bank's credit risk exposure. In/uni00A0repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions, ABN/uni00A0AMRO gets the securities returned at maturity. The/uni00A0counterparty in the transactions holds the securities as collateral, but has no recourse to other assets of ABN/uni00A0AMRO./uni00A0\n\n## Continuing involvement in transferred financial assets derecognised in their entirety\n\nThe bank has no material transferred assets that are derecognised in their entirety but where ABN/uni00A0AMRO has continuing involvement.\n\n## Pledged and encumbered assets\n\nPledged and encumbered assets are no longer readily available to ABN/uni00A0AMRO to secure funding, to satisfy collateral needs or to be sold to reduce the funding requirement. The following activities conducted by ABN/uni00A0AMRO give rise to pledged assets:\n\n- H cash and securities provided as collateral to secure trading and other liabilities, mainly derivatives;\n- H mortgages and SME loans pledged to secure funding transactions such as covered bonds and securitisations;\n- H securities lent as part of repurchase and securities lending transactions.",

These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary in standard professional securities transactions.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO controls the credit risk associated with these activities by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value on a daily basis and, when necessary, requiring additional collateral to be deposited with or returned to the group.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                             | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Fair value of securities received which can be sold or repledged | 71,372             | 57,436             |\n| - of which: fair value of securities repledged/sold to others    | 52,417             | 41,454             |\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has the obligation to return securities accepted as collateral to its counterparties.\n\n## Significant restrictions on the ability to access or use the bank's assets\n\nRestricted financial assets consist of assets pledged as collateral against an existing or contingent liability and encumbered assets. Other restrictions impacting on the bank's ability to use assets include:\n\n- H Assets as a result of collateralising repurchase and borrowing agreements (31 December 2021: EUR/uni00A016.1/uni00A0billion; 31/uni00A0December 2020: EUR/uni00A016.7/uni00A0billion);\n- H Assets held in certain jurisdictions to comply with local liquidity requirements and that are subject to restrictions in terms of their transferability within the group (31 December 2021: EUR/uni00A00.8/uni00A0billion; 31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A00.9/uni00A0billion);\n- H ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank N.V. is in general not subject to any significant restrictions that would prevent the transfer of dividends and capital within the group, except for regulated subsidiaries that are required to maintain capital in order to comply with local regulations (31 December 2021: EUR/uni00A00.6/uni00A0billion; 31 December 2020: EUR/uni00A01.1/uni00A0billion).",

Acceptances comprise undertakings by ABN/uni00A0AMRO to pay bills of exchange drawn on clients. ABN/uni00A0AMRO expects most acceptances to be settled simultaneously with the reimbursement from clients. Acceptances are not recognised in the balance sheet and are disclosed as commitments.\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts\n\nA financial guarantee contract requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs if a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Initial recognition of financial guarantee contracts is at their fair value. Subsequent measurement is at the higher of the amount of the expected credit loss and the amount initially recognised, less - when appropriate - the cumulative amount of income recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the balance sheet, but disclosed if the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is not more likely than not or if the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is more likely than not, however cannot be reliably estimated.\n\n## Committed credit facilities\n\nCommitments to provide credit take the form of approved but undrawn loans, revolving and underwriting facilities. New loan offers have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement period.\n\n## Guarantees and other commitments\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers to third parties. These transactions have fixed limits and generally extend for periods of up to 5 years. Expirations are not concentrated in any particular period. ABN/uni00A0AMRO also provides guarantees by acting as a settlement agent in securities borrowing and lending transactions.\n\nMany of the contingent liabilities and commitments are expected to expire without being paid out in whole or in part. This means that the amounts stated do not represent expected future cash flows. Additionally, guarantees and letters of credit are supported by varying levels of collateral.\n\nFurthermore, statements of liability within the meaning of Article 403, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code have been issued for a number of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's affiliated companies (see also the chapter on Other information).\n\nThe committed credit facilities, guarantees and other commitments are summarised in the following table. The amounts stated in the table for commitments assume that amounts are fully paid out. The amounts shown in the table for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum amount ABN/uni00A0AMRO is exposed to if the contract parties completely fail to perform as contracted.\n\n1",

ABN/uni00A0AMRO's legal predecessor, Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V., ABN/uni00A0AMRO and several (former) subsidiaries were directly or indirectly involved in these transactions in the past in various roles. Certain criminal investigation proceedings relate to the activities of these entities and individuals involved at the time. This also resulted in search warrants being issued against ABN/uni00A0AMRO. ABN/uni00A0AMRO cooperates with these investigations. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has no knowledge of the results of any such investigation.\n\nFurthermore, ABN/uni00A0AMRO frequently receives information requests from German authorities in relation to other (criminal) investigations. ABN/uni00A0AMRO cooperates and provides the requested information to the extent possible. Although a number of subsidiaries associated with these transactions have been sold by means of a management buy-out, legal risks remain for ABN/uni00A0AMRO, in particular relating to criminal and civil law. All material tax issues with respect to ABN/uni00A0AMRO's reclaims for cum/ex transactions have been settled with the German tax authorities. With respect to cum/cum transactions, the German Federal Ministry of Finance released 2 circular rulings dated 9 July 2021 (published 15 July 2021) in which there is a change in interpretation of tax legislation compared to previous circular rulings. These new circular rulings require the German local tax authorities to recollect dividend withholding tax credited to taxpayers where such credits relate to cum/cum strategies. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has collected dividend withholding tax related to transactions that might be considered as cum/cum transactions under the new circular rulings. In anticipation of a decision of the German tax authorities, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has paid the relevant dividend withholding tax amounts./uni00A0However, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has retained its rights to contest any such decision. With respect to cum/cum securities lending transactions with German counterparties as borrowers, ABN/uni00A0AMRO is exposed to civil law compensation claims from these counterparties resulting from crediting entitlements that have been denied or will be reclaimed by the relevant German tax authorities. Based on the analyses performed, ABN/uni00A0AMRO considers it rather unlikely that such claims will be successful. However, it cannot be ruled out.\n\nIt cannot be excluded that ABN/uni00A0AMRO or subsidiaries will be faced with financial consequences as a result of their involvement in dividend stripping transactions, including penalties and other measures under criminal law and civil law claims. It is currently unclear, however, how the German prosecution authorities' investigations will impact ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its subsidiaries and if and to what extent penalties or forfeiture orders will be imposed. It is also uncertain whether tax authorities or third parties will successfully claim amounts from ABN/uni00A0AMRO in (secondary) liability or other civil cases. Therefore, the financial impact cannot be reliably estimated at this time and no provision has been made in this respect.",

The investigation of the NPPS is related to ongoing tax proceedings before the Dutch courts between the third party and the Dutch tax authority regarding the set-off by the third party of dividend withholding tax credits against its corporate tax liabilities. The District Court ruled in favour of this third party in 2018.\n\nThe Court of Appeal annulled the ruling of the District Court and ruled in favour of the Netherlands tax authority in 2020. An appeal with the Supreme Court has been filed against the ruling of the Court of Appeal and is currently pending. The NPPS informed ABN/uni00A0AMRO that it is a suspect in the investigation due to its involvement in certain of these transactions. The NPPS is gathering information in connection The NPPS sought various documents in connection with its investigation and ABN/uni00A0AMRO is cooperating with the investigation.\n\nThe timing of the completion of the investigation and the outcome are uncertain. It cannot be excluded that ABN/uni00A0AMRO will/uni00A0be faced with financial consequences as a result of the investigation. The potential financial impact of the investigation cannot be reliably estimated at this time and no provision has been made.\n\n## Duty of care matters\n\nA number of proceedings have been initiated against ABN/uni00A0AMRO for alleged breach of its duty of care in transparency related standards. Where applicable, provisions for these matters have been made.\n\nThere can be no assurance that additional proceedings will not be brought or that amounts demanded in claims brought to/uni00A0date will not rise. Current proceedings are pending and their outcome, as well as the outcome of any threatened proceedings, is uncertain, as is the timing of reaching any finality on these legal claims and proceedings. Although the consequences could be substantial for ABN/uni00A0AMRO and potentially affect its reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, it is not possible to reliably estimate or quantify ABN/uni00A0AMRO's exposure at this time. These uncertainties are likely to continue for some time.\n\n## Cross-liability\n\nOn 6 February 2010, the former ABN AMRO Bank N.V. demerged into two entities: NatWest Markets N.V. (formerly known as RBS N.V.) and ABN AMRO Bank N.V. On the division of an entity by demerger, Dutch law establishes a cross-liability between surviving entities for the benefit of the creditors at the time of the demerger. ABN AMRO's cross-liability amounts to EUR 1.2 billion (31 December 2020: EUR 1.4 billion), for which NatWestMarkets N.V. has posted collateral of EUR 0.4 billion (31 December 2020: EUR 0.7 billion).\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is involved in a number of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business in various jurisdictions. In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management estimates the outcome of legal, regulatory and arbitration matters, and takes provisions to the income statement when losses with respect to such matters are more likely than not. Provisions are not recognised for matters for which an expected cash outflow cannot be reasonably estimated or that are not/uni00A0more likely than not to lead to a cash outflow. Some of these matters may be regarded as a contingency. In particular, the following matters are regarded as contingencies:\n\n- H ABN/uni00A0AMRO, certain of its subsidiaries and some of their client funds had exposure to funds that suffered losses (in some cases, significant losses) as a result of the Madoff fraud. The provision of custodial services resulted in several legal claims, including by the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities trustee in bankruptcy (Irving Picard) and the liquidators of certain funds, who are pursuing legal action in an attempt to recover payments made as a result of the fraud and/or to compensate their alleged losses. ABN/uni00A0AMRO and certain ABN/uni00A0AMRO subsidiaries are defendants in these proceedings. Even though these proceedings have been ongoing for several years, they are still in a preliminary stage. Hence, it is not possible to estimate the total amount of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's potential liability, if any.\n- H The Imtech Group was declared bankrupt in August 2015. ABN/uni00A0AMRO was one of the banks that extended financing to this group and participated in the second rights offering of October 2014. By letter of 20 January 2018, Stichting Imtechclaim and Imtech Shareholders Action Group B.V. held ING, Rabobank, Commerzbank and ABN/uni00A0AMRO liable for alleged misstatements in the prospectuses and for alleged actio pauliana (fraudulent preference). By letter of 28 March 2018 the VEB held parties including ABN/uni00A0AMRO liable for damage allegedly suffered by the Imtech investors. On 10 August 2018, ABN/uni00A0AMRO received formal notification from Imtech's trustees that they were seeking to nullify a large number of transactions and claim various damages. The letter aimed to interrupt limitation periods in view of the possible claims against Imtech's lenders, bondholders and underwriting banks. It appears likely that litigation will be started by the\n\n1",

Two execution-only clients of ABN/uni00A0AMRO have commenced proceedings against ABN/uni00A0AMRO and are claiming an amount in excess of EUR/uni00A0600,000. Their claim is based on alleged prospectus liability, together with an alleged breach of the duty of care. The District Court of Amsterdam dismissed the claims of the two-execution only clients in March 2020. An appeal was lodged in 2020 at the Court of Appeal of Amsterdam. The Court of Appeal rendered judgement at the end of 2021 and confirmed the earlier ruling of the District Court of Amsterdam and dismissed the claims of the two execution-only clients.\n\n- H On 18 October 2018, Eurostar Diamond Traders N.V. (EDT) filed civil law proceedings against ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank N.V. in the Antwerp District Court, claiming a total amount of USD 720 mio. This amount includes an unsubstantiated claim for damages of USD 600 mio on the ground that ABN/uni00A0AMRO and Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) allegedly deliberately caused EDT's demise. EDT and Eurostar Diamond Traders International N.V., EDT's parent company, were both declared bankrupt in a final decision in 2020. In August 2020, the EDT appointed trustees indicated that they did not want to continue this claim. On 11 December 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO, SCB and the EDT trustees reached an amicable settlement. This settlement will be final when approved by the supervisory judge and the Bankruptcy Court of Antwerp. The approvals from the supervisory judge and the Bankruptcy Court of Antwerp are still pending.\n- H In February 2018, ABN/uni00A0AMRO sold its Luxembourg subsidiary to BGL BNP Paribas (BGL). BGL is now being sued by a Luxembourg fund, LFP I SICAV SIF (LFP), which alleges that the Luxembourg subsidiary, in its capacity as custodian of a sub-fund of LFP (Columna), should have prevented an investment of USD 10/uni00A0million from being made. LFP is claiming restitution of this amount from BGL in procedures before the District Court of Luxembourg. BGL notified ABN/uni00A0AMRO of this claim in January 2020 and, in June 2020, summoned it to appear in these proceedings in an intervention procedure. In July 2020, LFP and its Hong Kong subsidiary issued an additional claim against BGL. This claim amounts to USD 38/uni00A0million. This claims, in addition to the previously claimed USD 10/uni00A0million, also relates to Columna . Since August 2020, this additional claim has also been part of the intervention procedure between BGL and ABN/uni00A0AMRO. In q3 2021, LFP reduced its additional claim from USD 38/uni00A0million to USD 23/uni00A0million (EUR/uni00A020/uni00A0million). Both claims are still pending before the Luxembourg court. In August 2020 and thereafter, BGL sent notices under the SPA alleging (and/or reserved its (alleged) rights to file) possible further claims against ABN/uni00A0AMRO, also in relation to LFP. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has responded with - in short - a formal challenge of liability under the purchase agreement or otherwise. As a result, it has to be awaited whether BGL will institute any further additional claims in this matter./uni00A0\n- H First Data Holding (FDH) and some of its group companies have indicated that they believe that one of FDH's subsidiaries, European Merchant Services B.V (EMS), has a claim against International Card Services B.V. (ICS). In spring 2016, FDH claimed for the first time that EMS was entitled to 51% of the proceeds of the sale of Visa Europe in 2015. The alleged claim amounted to approximately EUR/uni00A037/uni00A0million plus interest. In August 2016, ICS refuted this claim. In September 2020, FDH repeated its alleged claim. In October 2020, EMS and FDH (now Fiserv) interrupted the limitation periods relating to EMS's alleged claim. In December 2020, ICS responded by rejecting this alleged claim again. As per 31 December 2021 EMS itselfhas not filed any claim against ICS. As a result, it has to be awaited whether and when EMS files such claim.\n- H Other contingencies include EUR/uni00A0131/uni00A0million related to an irrevocable payment commitment (IPC) to the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Brussels. In April 2016, the SRB provided credit institutions with the option to fulfil part of their obligation to pay the annual ex-ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) through IPCs. To secure full and punctual payment, when called by the SRB, credit institutions needed to constitute cash collateral and fully transfer legal ownership to the SRB./uni00A0",

The variable compensation consists of a cash element and a share-based element settled in cash. The cash element in the variable compensation plan is recognised in accordance with IAS 19 and the other element qualifies as a cash-settled share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\nThe compensation is granted for a certain performance year for 50% in cash and for 50% in share-based compensation settled in cash. The vesting conditions include bad leaver conditions and consist of a deferral period and a retention period until the share-based compensation is settled in cash.\n\nUp to and including the performance year 2019, the share-based compensation settled in cash/uni00A0(depositary receipt) vests for 30% two years after the performance year. The remaining 20% vests in three equal tranches in the third, fourth and fifth year following the performance year. At the end of the vesting period, participants receive the cash value of the five-day average of an ABN AMRO listed depositary receipt (DR).\n\nThe share-based compensation settled in cash/uni00A0granted for 2019 and the years before gives the option to request DRs rather than cash. This choice can be made during the quarter in which settlement takes place and is subject to Supervisory Board approval. This equity component in the plan is valued at nil until the request is approved. Participants receive the same amount of fair value, regardless of whether they choose cash or DRs. If participants choose DRs, the value of the DRs is transferred in its entirety from the liability to an equity account. The actual delivery to the participant is expected to take place in the same quarter as the choice is made. ABN AMRO will not issue additional shares for the compensation granted for 2019 and before, but will buy shares in the market when needed. As the purchase of shares is expected to take place in the quarter during which the DRs are delivered, there is no impact on (diluted) earnings per share.\n\nAs from performance year 2020, the DRs were replaced by performance certificates (PCs) as share-based compensation settled in cash.

The programme/uni00A0commenced/uni00A0on/uni00A010 February 2022 and is expected to end no/uni00A0later than/uni00A0June/uni00A02022. Through this programme ABN/uni00A0AMRO has added share buybacks/uni00A0as an instrument for managing its/uni00A0capital position. The/uni00A0Basel/uni00A0IV threshold for share buybacks remains unchanged for the time being as/uni00A0the bank's/uni00A0capital buffer is/uni00A0sufficient to/uni00A0consider future share buybacks./uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO is aiming for/uni00A0a/uni00A0gradual reduction over time, in a constructive dialogue with/uni00A0the regulator.\n\n## Sale of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Levensverzekering N.V.\n\nOn 15 February 2022, ABN/uni00A0AMRO announced that it had reached agreement on the sale of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Levensverzekering N.V., the life insurance subsidiary of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Verzekeringen Holding B.V., to NN Group N.V. After this transaction, ABN/uni00A0AMRO Verzekeringen Holding B.V. will continue as a non-life insurer and intermediary. The sale of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Levensverzekering N.V. is subject to regulatory approval. ABN/uni00A0AMRO estimates that it will recognise a gain from the sale, which is expected to close in the second half of 2022.\n\n## Russia-Ukraine war\n\nIn light of the recent developments in respect of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, ABN AMRO has assessed the direct and indirect impact of this political event on the bank and its customers. The bank's direct exposure to Russia is approximately EUR 50 million. This exposure has largely been mitigated because it relates partly to assets of Russian clients outside Russia and to short-term trade transactions. The bank has no direct exposure in respect of Ukraine or Belarus.\n\nFurther escalation of the conflict could also have indirect consequences for the bank's customers in the form, for example, of/uni00A0higher gas prices, sanctions on trade with Russia and increased cybersecurity concerns as a result of a probable increase in criminal activities. These indirect consequences are difficult to quantify, but the bank's management is paying appropriate attention to the developments.\n\n## Authorisation of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\n8 March 2022\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nT.

ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank N.V. applies the option as included in Section/uni00A02:362 paragraph 8. ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank N.V. prepares its Consolidated Annual Financial Statements in accordance with/uni00A0International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS). Reference is made to/uni00A0the/uni00A0accounting policies section in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements and the respective notes.\n\n## Corporate information\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank N.V. is registered at Gustav Mahlerlaan 10, 1082 PP Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Chamber of Commerce number 34334259).\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe impairment requirements of IFRS 9 are applicable to financial instruments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI. These/uni00A0requirements also apply to intercompany transactions, which are eliminated upon consolidation. In ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank's Company Annual Financial Statements, the elimination of expected credit losses on intercompany transactions with subsidiaries is recognised in the carrying amount of the loans and advances and participating interests in group companies.\n\nParticipating interests in group companies are measured at net asset value, determined on the basis of EU IFRS. The share in/uni00A0the results of participating interests in group companies is reported in accordance with the principles of valuation and profit determination that apply to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional and presentation currency of the company, rounded/uni00A0to the nearest/uni00A0million (unless otherwise stated).\n\n## 2 Net interest income\n\nNet interest income for 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A03,087/uni00A0million, a decrease of EUR/uni00A0267/uni00A0million compared to EUR/uni00A03,354/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\nNet interest income comprises interest income from loans, investments and other lending, interest expense on borrowings/uni00A0by ABN/uni00A0AMRO and client accounts, and the results from interest rate and foreign exchange contracts entered/uni00A0into for hedging purposes. Interest income from loans and advances customers amounted to EUR/uni00A01,794/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A02,228/uni00A0million).\n\n## 3 Results from financial transactions\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                            |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Securities trading and derivatives transactions |     82 |    208 |\n| Foreign exchange transaction results            |    -29 |    104 |\n| Other                                           |     59 |     12 |\n| Total results from financial transactions       |    112 |    324 |\n\nResults from financial transactions decreased by EUR/uni00A0212/uni00A0million in 2021 to EUR/uni00A0112/uni00A0million. This was mainly due to a/uni00A0decrease in results from foreign exchange transactions and interest rate derivatives.\n\n1",

To a lesser extent, the/uni00A0wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio resulted in an increase in retention payments.\n\nThe decrease in defined contribution plan expenses of EUR/uni00A012/uni00A0million was due to a release following a favourable court ruling.\n\nOther personnel expenses decreased by EUR/uni00A073/uni00A0million due to higher restructuring provisions related to staff expenses in 2020. The decrease is also related to fewer dismissal payments and lower short-term employee benefit expenses than in 2020, due to Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n## 7 Cash and balances at central banks\n\nCash and balances at central banks increased by EUR/uni00A02.6/uni00A0billion, mainly due to issuance of senior non-preferred bonds in issued debt (EUR/uni00A02.6/uni00A0billion).\n\n## 8 Short-term government paper\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                              | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Short-term government paper held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 35,934             | 38,727             |\n| Short-term government paper held for trading                                      | 480                | 639                |\n| Short-term government paper                                                       | 36,414             | 39,366             |",

This was offset by the movement in transactions with third parties relating to the net impact of an increase of EUR/uni00A01.4/uni00A0billion pertaining to the TLTRO participation.\n\nABN AMRO participates in the targeted longer-term refinancing operations III (TLTRO III) for an amount of EUR 35.0 billion, of which EUR 32.0 billion was drawn in June 2020 and EUR 3.0 billion in June 2021. The funding has a quarterly repayment option. TLTRO III offers ABN AMRO funding at attractive conditions. A guaranteed interest rate discount of 50bps applies to the interest rate period from 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2022. An additional interest rate discount of 50bps over the remaining interest period can be achieved if specific targets linked to the issuance of new loans to non-financial corporations and households are met. The TLTRO III funding is accounted for at amortised cost, with an effective interest rate equal to the Main Refinancing Operations rate. The discounts, both conditional and unconditional, are accounted for as government grants and recognised in interest income. At the year-end, there was a reasonable expectation that the conditions/uni00A0applicable for the additional discount were met./uni00A0As a result, a catch-up adjustment was made to recognise the additional 50bps discount in interest income.\n\n## 18  Due to customers\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Group companies        | 5,773              | 6,128              |\n| Third parties          | 229,235            | 223,169            |\n| Due to customers       | 235,008            | 229,297            |\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2020   |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Current accounts       | 117,631            | 100,855            |\n| Demand deposits        | 92,895             | 102,036            |\n| Time deposits          | 13,293             | 13,025             |\n| Total deposits         | 223,819            | 215,916            |\n| Securities financing   | 7,944              | 8,926              |\n| Other due to customers | 3,245              | 4,455              |\n| Due to customers       | 235,008            | 229,297            |\n\nDue to customers increased by EUR/uni00A05.7/uni00A0billion, mainly due to an increase in current accounts.

        "page_content": "## Restructuring\n\nRestructuring provisions cover the costs of the restructuring plans for which implementation has been formally announced. The decrease relates to the use of the provision.\n\n## Legal provisions\n\nLegal provisions are based on best estimates available at the year-end and taking into account the opinion of legal specialists. The timing of the outflow of cash related to these provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability of the outcome and the time required to conclude litigation. Any provision recognised does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. Legal provisions increased mainly because of the increase in the provision for variable interest.\n\n## Variable interest rates for consumer loans\n\nOn 3 March 2021, the Kifid Appeals Committee confirmed a ruling of the Kifid Disputes Committee about the recalculation of/uni00A0the variable interest charged to a specific client on a revolving credit. In short, Kifid ruled that ABN AMRO should have followed the market rate while establishing the variable interest rate for certain revolving consumer credits.\n\nIn light of the Kifid ruling, ABN AMRO reached agreement with the Dutch Consumers' Association (Consumentenbond Claimservice) on 5 September 2021 regarding a compensation scheme for affected clients. The compensation scheme entailed a proactive recalculation of variable interest charged as from 1 January 2008 on various revolving consumer credits offered by ABN AMRO. In Q4 of 2021, ABN AMRO has decided to (where possible and applicable) proactively recalculate variable interest charged as from 1 January 2001.\n\nIt is unclear what the exact scope and application of the Kifid ruling is and whether the ruling will have a certain knock-on effect on other products with variable interest rates, beyond the range of products covered by the compensation scheme. Recent rulings from Kifid regarding other credit providers (in relation to mortgage loans) suggest that Kifid envisages a broad scope. ABN AMRO cannot give a reliable estimate of the (potentially substantial) financial risk of these contingent liabilities not provided for.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions decreased mainly due to the usage of 'Know Your Client' provision.\n\n## AML remediation programme\n\nTo address shortcomings, as well as increasingly strict regulations and continuously evolving forms of financial crime, ABN AMRO had already started an extensive bank-wide AML remediation programme. In 2021, the remediation of client files has progressed. The total provision regarding the AML programme amounted to EUR 66 million at 31 December 2021.\n\n## AML settlement\n\nIn April 2021, ABN AMRO accepted a settlement offer from the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service in connection/uni00A0with its investigation of the bank's AML activities in the Netherlands over the period 2014-2020. ABN AMRO agreed/uni00A0to pay a fine of EUR 300 million and a disgorgement of EUR 180 million. The total amount of EUR 480 million has been/uni00A0recorded in other expenses at Group Functions in Q1 2021 and has therefore no further impact on past or present/uni00A0provisions. ABN AMRO was/uni00A0informed that an individual filed a complaint against the AML settlement between the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service and ABN AMRO under section 12 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure with the Court of Appeal in The Hague. ABN AMRO was also informed that the complaint has been denied by the court of appeals.",

The decrease in derivatives was mainly due to lower IR swaps as a result of increased interest rates and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes.\n\nOther includes the lease liability relating to the sale and leaseback of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's head office at Gustav Mahlerlaan in Amsterdam.

For the year 2021 a final dividend has been proposed of EUR 0.61 per share.\n\n## Capital securities\n\nSecurities classified as Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital are perpetual, junior, resettable securities that are callable and are considered part of equity. The payment of interest on the AT1 capital securities had an impact on equity of EUR/uni00A091/uni00A0million.\n\n1",

After this transaction, ABN/uni00A0AMRO Verzekeringen Holding B.V. will continue as a non-life insurer and intermediary. The sale of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Levensverzekering N.V. is subject to regulatory approval. ABN/uni00A0AMRO estimates that it will recognise a gain from the sale, which is expected to close in the second half of 2022.\n\n## Russia-Ukraine war\n\nIn light of the recent developments in respect of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, ABN AMRO has assessed the/uni00A0direct and indirect impact of this political event on the bank and its customers. The bank's direct exposure to Russia is/uni00A0approximately EUR 50 million and this has largely been mitigated because it relates partly        to assets of Russian clients outside Russia and to short-term trade transactions. The bank has no direct exposure in respect of Ukraine or Belarus.\n\nFurther escalation of the conflict could also have indirect consequences for the bank's customers in the form, for example, of/uni00A0higher gas prices, sanctions on trade with Russia and increased cybersecurity concerns as a result of a probable increase in criminal activities. These indirect consequences are difficult to quantify, but the bank's management is paying appropriate attention to the developments.\n\n## Authorisation of the Company Annual Financial Statements\n\n8 March 2022\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nT.

        "page_content": "## Our approach to reporting\n\n## General\n\n## Purpose of our Integrated Annual Report\n\nThe purpose of our Integrated Annual Report is to explain how, over time, we create value for our stakeholders - not only as a provider of banking and other financial services, but also as a responsible employer and an active contributor to society as a whole. We do this by explaining our business, strategy and financials and non-financial performance during the year, but also by providing information in the areas of risk and capital management and our governance structure - all in compliance with regulatory requirements. This report has been written for all stakeholders, including providers of financial capital.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nContent in this report is based on extensive internal reporting. Where external sources are used, this is clearly indicated in the text. To decide content, ABN AMRO applies a materiality test; only content that is sufficiently material to/uni00A0the bank's strategy, performance, reputation or value creation is included. Content is reviewed by ABN AMRO's Group Disclosure Committee, and approved by the bank's Executive Board and Supervisory Board prior to publication. Ultimately, the Executive Board is responsible for the content, accuracy and integrity of the report. In addition to adherence to all regulatory requirements, the Executive Board also confirms that this report has been prepared and assured in accordance with the International Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework. Production of this report is overseen by ABN AMRO's Finance and Brand, Marketing & Communications departments.\n\n## General reporting guidance\n\n- \u00c5 Our Integrated Annual Report is our primary statutory and regulatory reporting disclosure. In addition, we publish other reports, including the bank's Impact Report, Pillar 3 Report, Social Impact and Human Rights Update 2021. Though published as part of our annual reporting suite, all reports have their own individual purpose and should be read stand-alone.\n- \u00c5 Unless stated otherwise, this report covers ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (including all business and consolidated entities). Annual data relates to the bank's financial year (1 January - 31 December).\n- \u00c5 The financial information contained in this Integrated Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS). Certain sections of the Risk, funding & capital chapter of this\n\nIntegrated Annual Report contain audited information and are part of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements. Audited information in these sections is/uni00A0labelled as 'Audited' in the respective headings. All/uni00A0capital metrics and risk exposures in this chapter are reported under the Basel III (CRD IV/CRR) framework (unless otherwise stated). All capital figures and ratios, including comparatives, are shown on a fully-loaded basis (unless otherwise stated).\n\n- \u00c5 The Company Annual Financial Statements comply with/uni00A0Title 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and apply the EU IFRS valuation principles which are also applied in/uni00A0the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements. For/uni00A0more general reporting guidance on the Company Annual Financial Statements, please also see Note 1 on/uni00A0page 268.\n- \u00c5 This report is presented in euros (EUR), which is ABN/uni00A0AMRO's functional and presentation currency, rounded to the nearest million, and sets out the results for the entire ABN AMRO organisation worldwide (unless otherwise stated).\n- \u00c5 All financial year-end averages in this report are based on/uni00A0month-end figures. Management does not believe these month-end averages present trends that are materially different from those that would be presented by daily averages. Certain figures in this report may not/uni00A0tally exactly due to rounding. In addition, certain percentages in this document have been calculated using rounded figures.\n- \u00c5 Non-financial data is collected centrally; this includes data relating to environmental performance, customer loyalty and employee engagement.\n- \u00c5 Please be aware that information provided in this report/uni00A0does not constitute an offer, investment advice or/uni00A0a financial service. Its purpose is not to encourage any/uni00A0person to buy or sell any ABN AMRO product or/uni00A0service. Nor should it be used as a basis for any investment decision. Any such decision can - and should/uni00A0- be/uni00A0based/uni00A0on the contents of this report, a definite prospectus and other key investor information (if,/uni00A0and to/uni00A0the extent, required).\n\n## Targets on our strategic KPIs\n\nAt ABN AMRO, we want to inform our stakeholders in a clear and consistent matter. This also applies to our targets - if and how we achieved our strategic objectives for the year.

        "page_content": "structure and client service model, however, we deem that our 2024 targets provide the most reliable information. As such, we have chosen not to include intermediate (shortterm) targets for our strategic KPIs, but only disclose clear targets for 2024. Performance of our strategic KPIs is nevertheless monitored carefully and we have initiated internal procedures to update our KPI set where needed and define clear short-term targets. We aim to announce our updated strategic KPIs and targets when we publish our/uni00A0Q2 results in August 2022. In addition to our strategic KPIs, we also have different operational KPIs on product level. As/uni00A0our operational sustainability KPIs play a vital role/uni00A0in our climate strategy, which we also expect to finalise during 2022, we have chosen to disclose these with intermediate targets towards 2024. We have also decided to increase these operational KPIs for the coming years to/uni00A0reflect the significant demand for sustainable financing and investments.\n\nIn line with 2020, we have not set targets beyond 2024. We/uni00A0will assess these targets periodically and update them/uni00A0accordingly for the period beyond 2024 at the appropriate time.\n\n## Value creation\n\n## Value-creating topics\n\nEvery two years, we conduct an extensive assessment of/uni00A0our operating environment; this allows us to identify our/uni00A0value-creating topics (VCTs) - where we believe ABN/uni00A0AMRO has potential to create the most value for its/uni00A0stakeholders. From these VCTs, we select 'strategic differentiators'; these form the basis of the bank's strategy, key performance metrics, targets and approach to reporting. We also identify 'fundamental value creators' - topics we/uni00A0believe are crucial in maintaining the bank's licence to/uni00A0operate.\n\nOur assessment comprises four distinct steps:\n\n- 1.   We define an initial long list of topics, based on a comprehensive review of media and trend reports, peer/uni00A0disclosures, current reporting requirements and/uni00A0the/uni00A0bank's Risk Event register.\n- 2.  The long list is reduced to a short list, which is then submitted for prioritisation to stakeholders, the bank's Executive Committee 1 and other senior management. Topics are rated according to their 'magnitude'\n- (i.e., potential impact on value creation) and 'likelihood' (i.e., how likely a topic is to bring about this impact) see/uni00A0materiality matrix.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nSome sections of this report contain statements that may be construed as forward-looking. These statements are not historical facts, and represent ABN AMRO's beliefs regarding future events, many of which are inherently uncertain and beyond the bank's control. The statements apply only at publication date. ABN/uni00A0AMRO does not intend to publicly update or revise these statements after publication, and assumes no responsibility to do so. Readers should, however, take into/uni00A0account disclosures made in future interim reports.\n\n## External assurance\n\nExternal assurance for this report was provided by EY (see/uni00A0Assurance Reports on pages 381-391). ABN AMRO believes that external assurance strengthens the credibility of its reporting, and helps improve internal informationgathering systems and processes. For this report, EY audited the Financial Statements (comprising the Consolidated and Company Annual Financial Statements, pages 261-367). EY has reviewed (limited assurance) the non-financial information included in the report (pages 5-65) and audited (reasonable assurance) the section 'Our Value-creating topics' (page 371).\n\n- 3.  From the results, we identify our strategic differentiators (see page 34) and fundamental value creators.\n- 4.  Based on the materiality matrix results, an assessment was conducted by Strategy & Sustainability and our Strategy Execution Team to define which topics were strategically differentiating to ABN AMRO based on our/uni00A0corporate strategy, strategic pillars and KPIs. The/uni00A0materiality matrix including the classification of strategic differentiators and the KPIs was subsequently validated by the Executive Committee 1 .\n\nThe assessment is overseen by Project and Steering Groups. Members are drawn from our Strategy & Sustainability, Operational Risk, Investor Relations, Brand,/uni00A0Marketing & Communications and Customer Experience departments. Results are presented to the bank's Executive Committee 1 for discussion and approval. The assessment covers all ABN AMRO businesses and/uni00A0consolidated entities worldwide.\n\nOur last assessment was conducted in 2020. To analyse this assessment, we carried out a 'pulse check' in 2021 (including a full media and peer analysis, a survey of regulatory developments and input from our Risk Event\n\n- 1 At the end of 2021, the Executive Committee ceased to exist in favour of an extended composition of the Executive Board.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

The model comprises inputs, business activities, outputs and outcomes. Inputs relate to/uni00A0the resources we use to operate our business; outputs and outcomes to the results of our business activities and/uni00A0the/uni00A0consequences of these activities for stakeholders and/uni00A0capitals. For our model, we use six types of capital, based on the <IR> Framework:\n\n| <IR> Capital   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Manufactured   | Fixed assets, including the value of houses and  the value of banking and investment services  provided by ABN AMRO                                                                                                                                         |\n| Financial      | Money and financial assets, including fees,  commissions and other income for the bank;  payments to suppliers, employees and  investors; earnings and cost of capital                                                                                      |\n| Intellectual   | Systems, processes and other intellectual  property, including asset management, other  fee-based services and data protection                                                                                                                              |\n| Human          | Employees' time, skills and productivity,  including the effects of employment and  workplace health & safety on well-being                                                                                                                                 |\n| Social         | Social ties, norms, networks and stakeholder  relations, including brand and customer  loyalty and the bank's impact on social issues  (such as child labour, gender discrimination,  low pay, and financial distress among clients  unable to repay loans) |\n| Natural        | Use of natural resources, including the bank's  contribution to climate change and impact on  the environment, such as pollution                                                                                                                            |\n\nThe VCM can be found on pages 40-41.\n\nIn addition, the VCM also shows our business activities -\n\nin/uni00A0effect, the bank's 'engine room', where value may be created or depleted through our lending, investment services, procurement, employment practices etc. Please/uni00A0note that our VCM provides an overview only.

The obligation to disclose according to the EU Taxonomy is limited to  corporates that are required to report under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). For credit institutions, the  regulation distinguishes between exposures to NFRD and non-NFRD companies, households, local governments, central  governments, central banks and supranational issuers.                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Directive scope                    | The NFRD (Directive2014/95/EU) requires all large undertakings which are public-interest entities and that employ on  average more than 500 employees during their respective financial years to report on their non-financial information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Non-Financial Reporting            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| EU Taxonomy eligibility            | An economic activity that is included in the list of activities that can potentially be environmentally sustainable. Currently,  only two of the six environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy have been implemented in the Delegated Acts. Our  eligibility percentage therefore only reflects these two objectives in our 2021 disclosure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| EU Taxonomy  mandatory eligibility | The reporting requirements under the EU Taxonomy are limited to specific counterparties. The mandatory eligibility  percentage should  be limited to all exposures eligible for the EU Taxonomy to households, local governments and NFRD  exposures. Eligibility for NFRD exposures may only be based on actual eligibility percentages of our NFRD counterparties.  Because this information is not yet publicly available, we have included estimates on NFRD eligibility voluntarily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| EU Taxonomy  voluntary eligibility | We have elected to voluntarily estimate and disclose eligibility of our corporate exposures based on their main economic  activity using the respective NACE codes of our corporate counterparties. This voluntary disclosure is in addition to our  mandatory eligibility disclosure and may not be comparable between issuers given that the method applied by ABN AMRO  is based on NACE and not the actual eligibility percentages of our NFRD corporate counterparties. For non-NFRD corporate  counterparties, we have also used NACE to determine eligibility; however, non-NFRD corporates are not included in the  scope of the numerator for both eligibility and alignment under the regulation. |\n| EU Taxonomy Alignment              | An economic activity that meets all requirements for a sustainable activity. These requirements are: 1) the activity  significantly contributes to an environmental objective, 2) the activity does no significant harm to any other environmental  objective, and 3) the activity meets a set of minimum social safeguards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Covered assets                     | This term is defined as the total on-balance sheet assets minus exposures to central governments, central banks and  supranational issuers and assets held for trading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Green Asset Ratio                  | This ratio is calculated by dividing our EU Taxonomy-aligned exposures by our total covered assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Energy labels\n\nEnergy labels\n\nEnergy labels are governed at European level and described in the Directive (2010/31/EU) on the energy performance on buildings. The directive was updated on 1 January 2021, which resulted in a new methodology for calculating the energy performance. The energy label figures in this report consist of a combination of energy labels under the old methodology (prior to 1 January 2021) and the new methodology. Buildings from 2016 onwards without a definite energy label are classified under the old methodology and estimated at energy label A. Buildings built after the 1st of January 2021 are classified under the new methodology and estimated at energy label A+++. Both estimates are based on the Dutch Building Decree. The category 'no label' consists of properties that are not required to have a label in the Regulation, while 'unknown' means ABN AMRO does not have the label of the property.\n\nWe use both preliminary labels (based on official government sources) and definitive labels in our energy label disclosure. In the event multiple real estate objects are related to one loan, the amount of the loan has been allocated to energy labels based on the floor area in square metres of the real estate objects.\n\nIn line with the European Banking Authority's requirements for reporting on financial information, the energy labels are assigned to any immovable property collateral, regardless of the loan/collateral ratio (commonly referred as the loan-to value ratio).\n\n## Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions\n\nGHG emissions for corporates\n\nThe ISS ESG database has been used for listed companies, while for unlisted companies the CBS and the PCAF databases have been used, which provide country and sector-specific carbon intensity information.\n\nGHG emissions for client assets\n\nGHG emissions for mortgages\n\nGHG emissions for commercial real estate\n\nFor the client assets portfolio, the calculations have been made using the ISS ESG database.\n\nFor mortgages the CBS database was used, which provides country-specific energy information per building unit. To/uni00A0convert the energy data into carbon emission data, the emission factors provided by www.co2emissiefactoren.nl have been used. An attribution factor on portfolio level has been applied, using the average loan to market value. As of Q4 2021, the indexation of collateral values is based on Calcasa information instead of the CBS index. Historic figures have not been adjusted.\n\nFor the residential commercial real estate portfolio, the data sources and the calculations are aligned with the mortgage portfolio. For the non-residential share of the commercial real estate portfolio, the calculations are based on floor area, energy labels and asset types, and the emission factors provided by the CBS database have been used. An attribution factor at portfolio level for residential and non-residential commercial real estate has been applied, using the loan-to-market value based on the most recent property value.\n\n## Sectors that highly contribute to climate change\n\nSectors highly contributing to climate change\n\nThese sectors are identified by NACE codes A to H and L, which are Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing, Energy, Water Supply, Construction, Wholesale and Retail Trade, Transport and Real Estate/Built Environment, as specified in Recital 6 of/uni00A0the Commission Delegates Regulation (EU) 2020/1818.\n\nCarbon-related assets\n\nA carbon-related organisation is an organisation that directly takes part in exploration, mining, extraction, distribution or/uni00A0refining of fossil fuels. These organisations can be identified as the companies excluded from EU-Paris Aligned Benchmarks (under Article 12(1) (d)-(g) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818).\n\nIdentification of such an organisation should be done based on revenue split. However, in this Integrated Annual Report this/uni00A0was done only for the client asset portfolio, while for the banking book portfolio these exposures were identified based on the NACE code of the counterparty's principal activity, due to data constraint. The NACE codes used to identify such organisations were: B05.10, B05.20, B06.10, B06.20, B09.10, C19.20, C20.11, D35.11, D35.21, D35.22 and D35.23. Since NACE code D35.11 does not distinguish between renewable and non-renewable energy, but renewable energy should not be labelled as carbon-related, we have excluded all exposures to clients where the principal activity is renewable energy or/uni00A0the loan specifically finances a renewable energy project.\n\n- \u00c5 Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions that occur from owned or controlled sources\n- \u00c5 Scope 2:  Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating or cooling\n- \u00c5 Scope 3: All indirect GHG emissions (not included in Scope 2) occurring in the value chain, including air travel and financed emissions\n\nThe financed GHG emissions have been calculated according to the PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry (2020) for the corporate loan book, mortgage portfolio and client asset portfolio. Scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 related to air travel have been calculated in accordance with the guidelines from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.",

(hereinafter: ABN AMRO or the bank), based in Amsterdam. The financial statements comprise the consolidated and company annual financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00c5 the accompanying consolidated annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of ABN AMRO as at 31 December 2021 and of its result and its cash flows for 2021 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book/uni00A02 of the Dutch Civil Code\n- \u00c5 the accompanying company annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of ABN/uni00A0AMRO as at 31 December 2021 and of its result for/uni00A02021 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe consolidated annual financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00c5 the consolidated statement of financial position as at/uni00A031/uni00A0December 2021\n- \u00c5 the following statements for 2021: the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows\n- \u00c5 the notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nThe company annual financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00c5 the company statement of financial position as at 31/uni00A0December 2021\n- \u00c5 the company income statement for 2021\n- \u00c5 the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n## Basis for our opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nMateriality\n\nEUR 160 million (2020: EUR 145 million)\n\nBenchmark applied\n\n0.7% of total equity (2020: 0.7% of total equity)\n\nExplanation\n\nBased on our professional judgment, a benchmark of 0.7% of total equity is an appropriate quantitative indicator of materiality as it best reflects the financial position of ABN AMRO. We determined materiality consistently with the previous financial year.\n\nWe are independent of ABN AMRO in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the 'Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties' (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\nWe believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Information in support of our opinion\n\nWe designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion and any findings were addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.\n\n## Our understanding of the business\n\nABN AMRO provides a broad range of financial services to retail, private and corporate banking clients. These activities are conducted primarily in the Netherlands, with foreign operations mainly related to private banking activities in Germany and France and clearing operations in the United States. The bank is at the head of a group of entities and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly.\n\n## Materiality\n\nWe start by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of EUR 8 million, which are identified during the/uni00A0audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Scope of the group audit\n\nABN AMRO is at the head of a group of components. The/uni00A0financial information of this group is included in the/uni00A0consolidated annual financial statements.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group components. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or on specific items.\n\nOur group audit mainly focused on significant group components of ABN AMRO in the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United States. We have:\n\n- \u00c5 performed ourselves audit procedures at the central group level and at the components in the Netherlands;\n- \u00c5 used the work of other component auditors within our EY network when auditing the group entities in France, Germany and the United States;\n- \u00c5 performed review procedures or specific audit procedures at other group components.\n\nWe sent instructions to component auditors, covering the significant areas and the information required to be reported to us. Based on our risk assessment, we determined the level of involvement in component audits. Because of the continuing travel restrictions and social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our site visits of the component teams in France, Germany and the United States were virtual and encompassed some, or all, of the following activities: reviewing key local working papers and conclusions, meeting with local management teams and obtaining an understanding of key processes. We interacted regularly with the component teams during various stages of the audit, using videoconferencing facilities. Where deemed appropriate, we attended component closing meetings with management, also using video conferencing facilities. We reviewed key working papers of component auditors using the EY electronic audit file platform, screen sharing or by the provision of copies of work papers submitted to the group audit team.\n\nThrough these procedures we covered in total 95% of the group's total assets and 88% of operating income.\n\n## Total assets\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating income\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy performing the procedures mentioned above at components of the group, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Teaming and use of specialists\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams both at group level and at component level included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for an audit of a listed bank. We included team members with specialised knowledge in the areas of IT audit, forensics, treasury, income tax and sustainability and have made use of our own specialists in the areas of valuation of derivatives, financial investments, real estate and goodwill, credit risk modelling, macro-economic forecasting, regulatory reporting compliance and legal, and actuarial calculations.\n\n## Our focus on climate risks and the energy transition\n\nClimate change and energy transition are emerging topics and lead to significant change for many businesses and society.

Furthermore, we refer to the introduction and strategy sections of the integrated annual report where ABN AMRO discloses its assessment and implementation plans in connection to climate related risks and the effects of energy transition.\n\nAs part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which climate-related and environmental risks and the effects of the energy transition are taken into account in estimates and significant assumptions underlying the valuation of certain account balances of ABN AMRO, including those related to the estimation of expected credit losses. Furthermore, we read the specific non-financial information on climate risks, eligible assets in the energy transition and carbon reduction and considered whether there is any material inconsistency with the financial statements.\n\nWe describe in our key audit matter relating to the estimation of impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers the audit procedures responsive to the assessed risk related to climate and environmental risk and energy transition. Based on the audit procedures performed, we do not deem climate-related risks to have a/uni00A0material impact on the financial reporting judgements, estimates or significant assumptions per 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\n## Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks\n\nWe identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the bank and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the/uni00A0supervisory board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer to the section Risk, funding & capital as included in the integrated annual report of ABN/uni00A0AMRO for management's fraud risk assessment.\n\nWe evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, whistle blower procedures and incident registration. We evaluated the design and implementation, and where appropriate, tested\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe operating effectiveness of certain of the internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present. We also considered whether the Covid-19 pandemic gives rise to specific fraud risk factors with remote working, office closures or illness possibly diluting the effectiveness of internal controls.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit and we also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we addressed the risks related to management override of controls. We performed procedures among others to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in the 'critical accounting estimates and judgements' section of the accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements. We also used data analysis procedures to identify and address high-risk journal entries. As described in our key audit matter related to impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers, we specifically considered whether the judgments and assumptions in the determination of this allowance indicate a management bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\nWe considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives (including internal audit, legal, security affairs, compliance, risk management and human resources), business line management and the supervisory board.\n\nThe fraud risks we identified, enquiries and other available information did not lead to specific indications of fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially impacting the view of the financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with/uni00A0laws and regulations\n\nWe assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry experience, enquiries of relevant executives (including internal audit, legal, compliance, risk management and human resources), business line management and the supervisory board, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit and compliance reports and performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, account balances and disclosures.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1",

Also, ABN AMRO is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or instructions.\n\nWe inspected lawyers' letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Specific attention was paid the status of the remediation of non-compliance with AML regulations. In case of potential non-compliance with laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements, we assessed whether ABN AMRO has an adequate process in place to evaluate the impact of non-compliance for its activities and financial reporting and, where relevant, whether ABN AMRO implemented remediation plans. Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us. Specifically with regard to the progress on the AML remediation activities, we make reference to the key audit matter on provisions and contingent liabilities for legal claims and compliance matters.\n\n## Our audit response related to going concern\n\nAs disclosed in the 'basis of preparation' of the notes to the financial statements, management assessed ABN AMRO's ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for at least the next 12 months. We discussed and evaluated this specific assessment and the level of professional judgment, the risk of management bias, and applied professional scepticism in doing so. We considered whether management's going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, contains all events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the bank's ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, we assessed the impact that such events and conditions may have on the bank's operations and forecasted cash flows, with a focus on whether the bank meets the regulatory solvency and liquidity requirements. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we did not identify serious doubts on the bank's ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\nThe following key audit matters that were included in our last year's auditor's report are not considered a separate matter for this year:\n\n- \u00c5 The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic - while the pandemic continues to impact normal operations and we continued to pay attention to this in our audit, we do no longer consider this as a key audit matter as uncertainties around this topic have decreased.\n- \u00c5 Investigation on compliance with the Dutch Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism - in 2021 ABN AMRO entered into a settlement with the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service in connection with its investigation of the bank's anti-money laundering activities in the Netherlands over the period 2014 up to 2020. As such, this is no longer considered a separate key audit matter in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Estimation of impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers\n\nRisk\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nKey observations\n\nLoans and advances to customers are measured at amortized cost, less an allowance for impairment. Impairment allowances represent the company's best estimate of expected credit losses. At 31 December 2021, the gross loan portfolio of ABN AMRO amounts to EUR 260.7 billion. The allowances for expected credit losses of EUR 2.4 billion are deducted from the gross loan balance and disclosed in Note 21 to the financial statements and in the sections credit risk management and credit risk review in the integrated annual report.\n\nThe expected credit losses are calculated based on risk staging of loans and using assumptions such as the probability of default, the loss given default, macro-economic scenarios and other forward-looking information. Following the granting of Covid-19 relief measures to certain customers, changes to the stage allocation have been made. Further, in response to the higher estimation uncertainties under the current economic circumstances a number of expert overlays have been recorded.\n\nThe determination of impairment allowances is a key area of judgment for management. The determination of the individual or collective recoverability of loans and advances to customers is subject to inherent estimation uncertainty. This also involves setting assumptions and determining scenarios for macro-economic developments, geopolitical trends, climate and other environmental related factors.\n\nGiven the materiality of the loans and advances to customers of ABN AMRO, the complex accounting requirements with respect to calculating allowances for expected credit losses and the subjectivity involved in the judgments made and the inherent risk for management override, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included, amongst others, evaluating the appropriateness of ABN AMRO's accounting policies related to expected credit losses according to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. We also obtained an understanding of the impairment allowance process, evaluated the design and tested operating effectiveness of internal controls relevant to the expected credit loss calculations. We performed substantive procedures, including the reconciliation of the data used in the allowance calculations and disclosures to source systems.\n\nFurther, with the support of our internal modelling specialists, we assessed the appropriateness of the models used by ABN AMRO for collectively determined impairment allowances and verified whether the models were adequately designed, implemented and periodically validated. We performed an overall assessment of the provision levels by risk stage to determine if they were reasonable considering the risk profile of the loan and advances portfolios, arrears management and credit risk management practices. We challenged the criteria used to allocate loans to risk stage 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with IFRS 9 and tested a sample of loans on appropriate stage allocation. Finally, we assessed the retrospective review procedures performed by management which compare modelled predictions to actual results and expert overlays. To assess the estimation uncertainty inherent in the calculations, we developed for a sample of models our independent range of estimates.\n\nFor individually assessed loan impairment allowances, we selected individual loans files on a risk-based basis across all stages and performed detailed credit file reviews to assess whether the bank correctly applied its credit risk and staging policy. We challenged the recovery scenarios applied and the applied weighting of these scenarios. With the support of our valuation specialists, we assessed the assumptions underlying the loan impairment calculation, such as estimated future cash flows and collateral valuations. Furthermore, we tested the data used by agreeing the data to source systems and underlying documentation and we reperformed the impairment calculations.\n\nRegarding the application of macro-economic scenarios and forward-looking information, we assessed with the support of our internal economic specialists the base case and alternative economic scenarios including the impact of Covid-19. This included challenging probability weights and the severity and magnitude of modelled downside scenarios, as well as assessing the sensitivity of changes in the assumptions in the calculations. We tested the appropriateness and the associated considerations of expert overlays and post model adjustments and recalculated a sample of these amounts. We also assessed the expert overlays and post model adjustments based on findings from specific regulatory inspections, industry sector trends, product wind-down decisions and considered the ongoing model redevelopments at ABN AMRO, as well as geopolitical, climate and other environmental related factors.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosures, as included in Note 21 to the financial statements and in the risk management section of the integrated annual report. In particular we evaluated that disclosures adequately convey the degree of estimation uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes under the different economic scenarios.\n\nBased on our procedures performed we consider the estimation of and disclosures on the impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers to be reasonable and in compliance with EU-IFRS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Estimation of other provisions and contingent liabilities and related disclosures\n\nRisk\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Key observations\n\nIn accordance with IAS 37 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets', ABN AMRO provides for liabilities related to, among others, legal claims, restructuring, and compliance remediation matters. As disclosed in Note 30 of the financial statements, ABN AMRO recognized at 31 December 2021 legal provisions, including the provision for compensation of variable interest, reorganization and other provisions, of EUR 398 million, EUR 178 million and EUR 181 million respectively. In Note 35 the commitments and contingent liabilities are disclosed. This includes contingent liabilities in respect of legal proceedings related to arbitrage and a number of duty of care proceedings. Furthermore, in the integrated annual report developments with regard to/uni00A0legal and compliance risk are disclosed.\n\nDevelopments at ABN AMRO with regard to the internal organization, services to customers and the range of products, as well as heightened regulatory scrutiny, give rise to increased attention from management when estimating the provisions, specifically in the determination of whether outflows in respect of identified matters are probable and can be estimated reliably and the appropriateness of assumptions and judgments used in the estimation of the provisions and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Therefore, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe evaluated ABN AMRO's accounting policies related to provisions and contingent liabilities in accordance with IAS 37, and whether assumptions and the methods for making estimates are appropriate and have been applied consistently. We also obtained an understanding of the organizational controls and the legal and regulatory framework of the company. Further, we evaluated the design and implementation of controls by ABN AMRO to identify, monitor and disclose provisions for obligations and contingent liabilities, and to assess the completeness and accuracy of data used to estimate provisions.\n\nFor significant provisions we challenged the provisioning methodology and tested the underlying data and assumptions used. Specifically, for the provision related to the variable interest client compensation scheme we performed test of details to underlying contract data and assessed the assumptions and judgments made by the bank, including the expected number of/uni00A0client responses to compensation offerings. We also performed test of details on the anti-money laundering remediation provision and assessed the progress of the number of files considered remediated and the use of external resources in the remediation. For the various restructuring programs following the new strategy of ABN AMRO we tested the calculations and assessed whether the IAS 37 criteria are met to record provisions per 31 December 2021. Lastly, for cases that were settled during 2021, such as the EUR 448 million payment in April 2021 to the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service in connection with/uni00A0its inspection of anti-money laundering activities at ABN AMRO, we verified the actual outflows.\n\nWe examined the relevant internal reports, minutes of management and supervisory board meetings, as well as regulatory and legal correspondence to assess developments and we performed follow-up procedures to examine the company's assessment of the impact on the financial statements and the adequacy of risk management disclosures. We obtained legal letters from external counsel and, where appropriate, involved legal and compliance specialists.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated whether the disclosures provided on the other provisions and contingent liabilities with regard to restructuring, legal and compliance matters are in compliance with the EU-IFRS requirements, and in particular whether they adequately convey the degree of estimation uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes. Finally, we evaluated the appropriateness of the compliance and legal risk disclosures in the integrated annual report.\n\nBased on our procedures performed we consider the provisions and the disclosures on provisions and contingent liabilities to be reasonable and in compliance with EU-IFRS.\n\n## Reliability and continuity of IT environment\n\nRisk\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Key observations\n\nThe activities and financial reporting of ABN AMRO are highly dependent on the reliability and continuity of the IT environment. Effective general IT controls with respect to change management, logical access, infrastructure and operations, support the integrity and continuity of the IT systems as well as the operating effectiveness of the automated controls.\n\nAs described in the risk management section operational (non-financial) risk in the integrated annual report, the IT environment and the IT organization of ABN AMRO continues to be strengthened. There is a risk that the general IT control measures may not always operate as intended and, as a result, internal controls are ineffective. Therefore, we identified the reliability and continuity of the IT environment to be a key audit matter.\n\nIT audit specialists are an integral part of the engagement team and assess the reliability and continuity of the IT environment to/uni00A0the extent necessary for the scope of our audit of the financial statements. In this context, we evaluated the design of the IT/uni00A0processes and tested the operating effectiveness of general IT controls, as well as application controls over data processing, data feeds and interfaces where relevant for the financial reporting.\n\nIn certain areas we performed additional substantive procedures on access management, cyber security, security event monitoring and segregation of duties for the related systems. We also assessed the possible impact of changes in IT during the year resulting from the internal transformation activities and remedial measures on the operating effectiveness of general IT controls and the automated controls. Where applicable, we tested internal controls related to cloud computing and third-party service providers.\n\nOur testing of the general IT controls and the substantive tests performed, provided sufficient evidence to enable us to rely on the adequate and continued operation of the IT systems relevant for our audit of the financial statements.",

Furthermore we have audited the section 'Our Value-creating topics' as included in the non-financial information on page 34 of the Integrated Annual Report. A review is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance. An audit is aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of assurance. The non-financial information in scope is included in the chapters 'Introduction' and 'Strategy, value creation & performance' (up to and including page 65) (hereafter: the/uni00A0non-financial information).\n\nBased on our review nothing has come to our attention that/uni00A0causes us to believe that the non-financial information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with/uni00A0the reporting criteria as explained in the section 'Reporting criteria' of our report.\n\nIn our opinion the section 'Our value-creating topics' is/uni00A0prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with/uni00A0the/uni00A0reporting criteria explained in the section 'Reporting criteria' of our report.\n\n## Basis for our conclusions\n\nWe have conducted our review of the non-financial information and our audit of the section 'Our value-creating topics' in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N, 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen' (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports), which is a specified Dutch/uni00A0Standard that is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information'. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section 'Our responsibilities' of our report.\n\nWe are independent of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands.
