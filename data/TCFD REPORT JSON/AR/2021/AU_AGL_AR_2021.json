The required elements of the Directors' Report, including the Operating and Financial Review (OFR) as required by ASIC Regulatory Guide 247, are covered on pages 9 to 88. Commentary on AGL Energy's financial performance specifically is contained on pages 9 to 53 and references information reported in the Financial Report (pages 89 to 183). The Financial Report includes AGL Energy Limited (the Company or Parent Entity) and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year ended 30 June 2021. Throughout the report, the consolidated entity is referred to as AGL Energy or the Group.\n\nThe Directors' Declaration forms part of the Financial Report under the Corporations Act.\n\n## Voluntary reporting frameworks\n\nThis report has been prepared with reference to the International Integrated Reporting Council's (IIRC) International Integrated Reporting Framework, as we believe it provides a useful basis for disclosing how we create sustainable value for our shareholders and other stakeholders over time. We have used the framework to demonstrate how consideration of risks and opportunities (both those arising from our business and those that exist in a broader operational context), our purpose and our values drive our strategy. We have also considered how the execution of our strategy creates value, applying a lens that is broader than financial performance alone.\n\nAGL Energy follows the guidance provided by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures voluntary disclosure framework (TCFD Framework). 'Accelerating Our Transition', our FY21 TCFD report which accompanies the Annual Report, details how we consider governance, risk management, strategy, and metrics and targets in relation to climate change. A summary of the TCFD disclosures is also included on page 16.\n\nAGL Energy has aligned our disclosures to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for 'Electrical Utilities and Power Generators' and 'Gas Utilities'. A SASB index is included in the ESG Data Centre on our website which identifies the extent to which each SASB disclosure requirement has been applied. In addition, AGL Energy has continued to prepare our disclosures in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. The ESG Data Centre includes a GRI index that outlines which topic-specific GRI standards have been used in the preparation of this report.\n\n## Assurance\n\nThe Remuneration Report (page 63 to 86) and the Financial Report (page 89 to 183) have been audited by Deloitte. Deloitte was also engaged to undertake limited assurance of selected Key Performance Indicators included in the Business Value Driver scorecards (page 21 to 28) in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (ASAE 3000). The Key Performance Indicators are to be read in conjunction with the definitions in the Glossary (page 187). Full details of the assurance scope, process and outcome are included in the assurance statement on page 181.",

        "page_content": "## Business Value Drivers\n\nThe International Integrated Reporting Framework describes six forms of capital (financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social and relationship and natural) but encourages organisations to adopt a categorisation and terminology appropriate to their business. In this report, AGL has grouped and defined these capitals into the seven distinct Business Value Drivers outlined below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CUSTOMERS\n\n## Social and relationship capital\n\nEffective and trusted relationships with residential, business and wholesale customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nManufactured capital\n\nEffective and efficient use of assets throughout the value chain that AGL uses, owns or has control of, to enable delivery of energy to the market and to customers.\n\n## COMMUNITIES & RELATIONSHIPS\n\nSocial and relationship capital\n\nThe strength of working relationships and trust with key stakeholders; brand and reputation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SYSTEMS & PROCESSES\n\nIntellectual capital\n\nAvailability and development of processes, knowledge, insights, systems and data, including energy portfolio management and customer analytics, to support and enhance business activities.\n\n## Forward looking statements\n\nThis report includes information about AGL Energy's performance for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. Any forward-looking statements are based on AGL Energy's current expectations, best estimates and assumptions as at the date of preparation, many of which are beyond AGL Energy's control. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the report.\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 interconnected goals that form a global benchmark for achieving a sustainable future for all. While many of the SDGs intersect with AGL Energy's operations, the three SDGs that are most material to our strategy and operations comprise SDG 13 - Climate Action; SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy; and SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PEOPLE\n\nHuman capital\n\nThe competencies, experience, behaviours, engagement and wellbeing of AGL's people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial capital\n\nAccess to and management of financial capital to support execution of strategy and investment in growth opportunities through retaining financial market support.\n\n## SDG\n\n## Business Value Driver\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 24\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 26\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 24\n\nPage 21\n\nPage 22\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 26\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 28\n\nPage 29\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccess to and stewardship and use of scarce natural resources, and AGL's impact on the natural environment, both directly and as a result of the products and services provided.\n\nInformation about performance in relation to each Business Value Driver is included in Section 3.2 of this report.",

I am pleased to present AGL Energy's Annual Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 (FY21).\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A year of continued evolution\n\nFY21 was extremely challenging for AGL Energy. There has been continued uncertainty regarding energy policy and an acceleration of the market forces that determine our strategy: customer demand, community expectations and advances in technology. This has included increasing pressure for energy companies and society as a whole to take accelerated action on climate change. At the same time, AGL Energy has responded to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic as our customers and the broader community grapples with these unprecedented circumstances.\n\nOur financial results for FY21 reflect these ongoing challenging market and operating conditions facing the energy industry, as well as the impact of the decline in wholesale electricity prices that has occurred over the past two years.\n\nAmid these conditions, we remained focused on keeping our people safe and on delivering for our customers, who are at the centre of everything we do. I would like to thank our people for all they have done over the last year to ensure that we continued to keep the lights on and to support our customers.\n\nI am pleased to report that we continued to grow customer numbers, reduce rates of customer churn and improved our Net Promoter Score over the course of the year.\n\n## Proposed Demerger\n\nOn 30 June this year, we announced AGL Energy's intention to undertake a demerger having regard to these challenging market conditions and the accelerating transition of the energy industry. The proposed demerger would result in two leading energy businesses with separate listings on the Australian Securities Exchange:\n\n- \u00b7 AGL Energy will become Accel Energy Limited (Accel Energy). Accel Energy will be Australia's largest baseload electricity supplier via the Loy Yang A, Macquarie Generation and Torrens Island sites, which will prioritise the responsible operation of these sites and facilitate their accelerated transition to low-carbon industrial energy hubs. Accel Energy will also be Australia's largest operator and offtaker of wind energy via the Macarthur, Hallett, Wattle Point and Oaklands Hill wind farms, with the potential to develop 1,600 MW of new wind projects.\n- \u00b7 AGL Australia Limited (AGL Australia) will be demerged as a new business. AGL Australia will be Australia's largest energy-led multi-product retailer of essential energy services to households and businesses. AGL Australia will also own and operate Australia's largest private hydro fleet as well as fast-start gas-fired power stations and a growing battery development portfolio, with capabilities across wholesale and decentralised electricity and gas trading, storage and supply. AGL Australia will also own AGL Energy's 20% equity interest in Powering Australian Renewables ( PowAR ).\n\n## As one of Australia's oldest businesses, AGL Energy has a proud heritage of leading change in the energy industry.\n\nThis leadership has created significant value for shareholders in prior years, including via the integration of our strong retail footprint with a baseload energy generation business. However, after careful consideration, the Board considers AGL Energy's current business structure needs to evolve in order to respond to recent changes in energy policy settings and market conditions, and that we should move forward with the demerger to protect shareholder value and enable each business to focus more effectively on their respective strategic opportunities and challenges presented by the accelerating energy transition.\n\nHaving the right leadership team in place for each entity was something the Board considered a priority. The identification of the Managing Director & CEOs for each entity followed an extensive search process that considered both internal and external candidates using external search firms. It is a testament to the depth of experience already within AGL Energy that the Board was able to identify Graeme Hunt and Christine Corbett as the executive leaders of Accel Energy and AGL Australia, respectively.",

        "page_content": "Graeme, in the Accel Energy Managing Director & CEO role on a fixed-term basis, will provide vital continuity of leadership amid this time of great change for our company and in the energy sector, as well as deep experience and know-how in running capital intensive industrial businesses in a complex multi-stakeholder environment.\n\nPatricia McKenzie's appointment as Chair of the Board of AGL Australia will provide the new business an unrivalled level of knowledge and experience in energy market design, governance and regulation. Christine's elevation to the role of Managing Director & CEO reflects her outstanding performance in stabilising and growing our customer business since joining us two years ago. She will bring a passionate customer focus to the leadership of AGL Australia while also providing important continuity.\n\n## The Board plans to put a demerger resolution to shareholders at shareholder meetings to be held in the fourth quarter of FY22.\n\nShareholders will receive a demerger booklet setting out the rationale for this proposal in detail during the first half of 2022.\n\n## Leading the business of transition\n\nIn early August 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the first instalment of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) which demonstrates the important role that industry, regulators and governments play in driving Australia's energy transition. The separation of the two businesses will allow both Accel Energy and AGL Australia to pursue their response to climate change and the energy transition in a more focused manner, building upon the commitments we made in AGL Energy's Climate Statement in June 2020.\n\n## Both companies will pursue strategies linked to the decarbonisation of their operations.\n\nAs Australia's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and largest electricity generation company, Accel Energy will embrace the responsibility and opportunities the energy transition brings to reinvent its business. Accel Energy will have a unique opportunity to drive the accelerating transition while creating a sustainable future for its business and the communities in which we operate beyond the life of coal-fired power. We have committed to Accel publishing a detailed climate change roadmap including specific decarbonisation targets showing clear progress relative to AGL Energy's existing emissions reduction trajectory.\n\nAGL Australia will be carbon neutral for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions following the demerger, offsetting the emissions it generates directly with high quality accredited instruments. AGL Australia will have a clear pathway toward carbon neutrality for its sourced electricity over time via its support of renewables developments and further offsets.\n\nAGL Energy has a proven track record of market leading disclosures. To ensure this legacy of transparency continues, the shareholders of both new entities will be provided with an opportunity to have their say on the climate reporting for both proposed demerged entities.\n\n## Accel Energy and AGL Australia each intend to put their respective climate reporting to a non-binding, advisory vote of shareholders at their first Annual General Meetings.\n\nIf the demerger does not proceed, AGL Energy will put its climate reporting to a non-binding, advisory vote of shareholders at its 2022 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Capital management\n\nWe are committed to, and confident of achieving, investment grade credit ratings for both Accel Energy and AGL Australia. In light of this, and as part of our preparation for the proposed demerger, we announced on 30 June 2021 that we would undertake the following capital management initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 cease the Special Dividend Program, meaning AGL Energy no longer intends to pay out an additional 25 percent of Underlying Profit after tax for the FY21 final dividend or in FY22; and\n- \u00b7 intention to underwrite the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) for the FY21 final and FY22 interim ordinary dividends.\n\nIn practice, this means we intend for AGL Energy to continue to pay ordinary dividends at 75% of Underlying Profit after tax for its remaining dividends and that shareholders will continue to have the option of subscribing under the DRP to receive shares in lieu of a cash dividend. These new shares will be available at a discount of 1.5% to the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of AGL shares in ordinary trading on ASX over a 20 trading day period commencing 30 August 2021. In addition, through the DRP underwrite program, AGL Energy will appoint Macquarie Capital (Australia) Limited to underwrite an amount equal to the total dividend payment. Any shortfall in subscriptions from AGL Energy shareholders for new shares under the DRP will then be issued to the underwriter. The underwriter will arrange for the sale of any shortfall volume on market. This process will enable AGL Energy to retain cash within the business equal to the total value of each dividend during the period it operates.\n\nThe Board acknowledges the impact upon shareholders of the loss of the proposed Special Dividend and the dilution caused by the issuance of new shares via the DRP underwrite program. However, these are prudent steps to take in the interests of protecting longterm shareholder value by supporting Accel Energy and AGL Australia in retaining strong and flexible balance sheets after the demerger.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nA key focus of the Board during FY21 was responding to the 'first strike' that AGL Energy received against its remuneration report at last year's AGM. Details of how we have listened and responded to the concerns raised by investors and proxy advisors are set out in the Remuneration Report.\n\n|",

The Board is grateful for everything Brett Redman delivered in his 15-year career with AGL.\n\nFollowing Brett's resignation in April, the Board appointed Graeme Hunt as Interim Managing Director & CEO given Graeme Hunt's deep experience with AGL - nine years on the Board and three as Chairman - coupled with his experience as a CEO and executive in industrial organisations over many years. The Board confirmed Graeme's permanent appointment as Managing Director and CEO of AGL, with effect from 1 July 2021.\n\nThe appointment of Graeme Hunt as interim-CEO in April resulted in my appointment to the role of Chairman in his place, which I have accepted with full knowledge of the strength of the Board and the Executive and the strategy we are delivering.\n\nThis year, we also farewell John Stanhope, who has served on the Board for over 12 years and will retire from the Board at the upcoming AGM. On behalf of the Board, I wish to convey our gratitude to John for his esteemed knowledge and participation on the Board, including having acted as Chair of the Audit & Risk Management Committee during his tenure. Mark Bloom has been appointed Chair of the Audit & Risk Management Committee, with effect from John's retirement.\n\nThe Board is currently undertaking a process to consider additional appointments to the Board of AGL in FY22, including the appointment of a Director with expertise in climate change risk, ESG governance and industry transition. The proposed demerger of AGL Energy will require the consideration of the composition of the Boards of each company to ensure that each Board (and each Board committee) has the skills and experience to fulfil their responsibilities on implementation of the demerger. The Board is working carefully through a structured process to identify Directors with skills and experience in climate change risk and ESG, energy markets, environmental issues, digital retail, technology, customer markets and other relevant skills and experience that will be required for the demerged entities.\n\n## AGM\n\nThis year our AGM will be held on Wednesday, 22 September 2021. In light of the continued uncertainty and potential health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we will hold an online AGM.\n\n## Shareholders will have the ability to participate remotely via an online platform or by lodging a directed proxy or direct vote in advance of the meeting.\n\nIn addition to the usual items of business, shareholders will be asked to consider three resolutions proposed by small groups of shareholders. The Board respects the right of shareholders to put forward resolutions. However, the Board does not consider these resolutions to be in the best interests of the company as a whole for the reasons detailed in the Notice of Meeting.\n\n## Looking to the future\n\nDespite being a challenging year for AGL Energy, I am optimistic about the future for AGL Energy and its shareholders - and the prospects of the proposed demerger creating a fresh platform for the business to address the challenges and opportunities to come.\n\nThe short-term outlook remains challenging as our financial performance in FY22 continues to reflect the material falls in wholesale electricity prices that have occurred in recent years, and we are taking action to strengthen our financial position.\n\nThe Board is taking action focused on long-term value for our shareholders and believes the proposed demerger will position us best to meet the existing and future challenges facing the company.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank AGL Energy's shareholders for their continued support.",

We have navigated the unpredictable nature of working and living in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside the effects on our business of severe reductions in wholesale electricity prices, and the changes to policy settings over recent years.\n\nAGL Energy is taking decisive action via the proposed demerger of AGL Australia from Accel Energy. Stepping into the role of Managing Director & CEO at this time has been a rewarding experience for me personally, as we seek to set up the business to emerge stronger from this period and to reposition AGL via our proposed demerger in order to protect and grow shareholder value in the future.\n\nDespite this challenging environment, I am proud of the way the AGL Energy team has continued to ensure our customers, our communities and our people are at the centre of everything we do.\n\nIn FY21, there was an overall improvement in AGL Energy's Health, Safety & Environment performance, illustrated by a reduction in the Total Injury Frequency Rate to 2.3 per million hours worked. However, the operation of power stations is an inherently high-risk activity. Unfortunately, in December 2020, one of our people was seriously injured in an incident at our Liddell Power Station. We are all thankful this worker is recovering well, but an incident like this is an important reminder of the dangerous work many of our employees face every day. We have since conducted a review of high-risk tasks and have implemented further enhancements designed to prevent similar incidents happening again.\n\n## Putting customers at the centre\n\nAs we adjusted to a new normal of living with the pandemic and lockdowns, we have remained committed to continuing to support our customers by providing financial aids such as payment plans and disconnection relief.\n\nIt is pleasing that we continue to grow customer numbers and improve the customer experience, reducing the rate of customer churn, and maintaining an improved net promoter score.\n\nOffering our customers more services has been another priority as we diversify our product offerings, becoming Australia's largest energy-led multi-product retailer.\n\nFollowing the launch of carbon neutral across electricity products in 2020, we have now expanded our carbon neutral offering across all AGL products, with over 260,000 carbon neutral services now in place.\n\nCustomers can now also access new solar battery bundles and our innovative electric vehicle subscription service.\n\nAs customers become increasingly connected, we want to be at the forefront of that transition. This year we expanded our offering to telecommunications, launching AGL broadband and mobile services.\n\nWe are looking to the future, by bringing world-class technology and innovation to Australia through our partnership with Ovo Energy, the UK's leading independent energy retailer. Ovo's customer platform technology presents an exciting opportunity to engage with customers more effectively in a multi-product environment.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## FY21 result\n\nThe financial result for FY21 reflected the significant market and operating headwinds as the impact of sustained falls in FY21 wholesale electricity prices and changes to energy market policy settings have flowed through to our results. This has driven a reduction in Underlying Profit after tax of 33.5 percent to $537 million and a corresponding reduction in dividends for the year to 75 cents per share, including the 10 cent special dividend paid in March.\n\nAGL Energy has a strongly competitive cost position in electricity generation. However, the lower wholesale electricity price environment has put pressure on the profitability of all generators, at the same time as government policy continues to stimulate the development of new supply capacity ahead of market demand. Coupled with changes to our provisions for long-term environmental restoration obligations, this sustained pressure on wholesale prices led us during the year to recognised impairments of $3.6 billion against our wholesale electricity fleet.\n\nAlthough there has been some recent recovery in wholesale electricity prices to more economically sustainable levels, we expect further margin pressure from this period of sustained lower prices in in FY22.\n\nConditions also remain challenging in our wholesale gas business as long-term, low-cost supply contracts continue to mature, translating to lower margins. Following the withdrawal of our proposal for a liquified natural gas (LNG) import jetty at Crib Point, we have incurred total charges of $124 million associated with costs incurred on the development. We have a highly flexible gas portfolio and a supply strategy which will enable customer demand to be met from existing and new domestic supply sources and proposed third party regasification projects, leveraging LNG supply options which we had developed for the Crib Point proposal.\n\nIn the context of this challenging environment, we announced a number of initiatives over the course of the year designed to preserve cash and ensure we have the strongest possible financial position as we pursue the proposed separation into Accel Energy and AGL Australia over the course of FY22.\n\nThese measures include a commitment to reduce real operating expenditure by $150 million in FY22, and a commitment to reduce sustaining capital expenditure by $100 million by FY23, complemented by targeted sales of non-core assets.\n\n## Delivering on our strategy\n\nNotwithstanding the market conditions and ongoing complexities presented by the pandemic, we made good progress over the course of FY21 to deliver on growth and transformation objectives.\n\nCustomer services achieved both organic and inorganic growth.\n\nWe acquired Click Energy and have ensured a smooth transition, welcoming Click Energy's 215,000 customers.\n\nThe acquisitions of both Epho and Solgen complement and strengthen our existing solar capabilities, enabling AGL Energy to deliver more tailored and innovative energy solutions for businesses.\n\n## We are now Australia's largest supplier of commercial solar with the systems and technologies in place to deliver more than 70 MW of commercial solar each year.\n\nWe were proud to announce 850 MW of grid-scale battery projects at our thermal generation sites across Australia by FY24, a key deliverable of our Climate Statement commitments. The 250 MW battery at Torrens Island is scheduled to be the first to commence construction. We're excited to see these plans begin to come to life; energy storage technology is critical in creating cleaner and smarter distributed energy infrastructure.\n\nWe continued our legacy as one of the largest private investors in renewable energy via our 20 percent interest in PowAR, which has recently completed the acquisition of Tilt Renewables. Our access to this platform reinforces our progress in the energy transition, supporting our orderly transition away from coal-fired power and responding to our customers' increasing appetite for clean energy.\n\nFor AGL Energy, participating in these acquisitions aligns with the commitments set out one year ago in our Climate Statement, representing the next steps in our decarbonisation journey.\n\nWe have made significant progress in each of our five Climate Statement commitment areas, helping us on the path to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n## Leading into a new future\n\nThe proposed demerger of AGL Australia from the new Accel Energy is an exciting milestone in AGL's 187-year history. It will position both businesses to focus on their part in Australia's accelerating energy transition. For AGL Australia, this means executing on a customer-led, multi-product strategy backed by a flexible trading, supply and storage position. For Accel Energy, it means ensuring the safe and efficient running of our thermal generation asset base as required by the market, engaging actively on policy matters pertaining to the transition and partnering to transform our operational sites to low-carbon industrial energy hubs.\n\n## I am excited for the opportunities ahead as we continue to execute on our strategy and undertake the demerger.\n\nOur operating environment will continue to test our resilience as an organisation, but I am confident that the changes we are making today will enable us to protect value for our shareholders as we create two leading organisations and prepare for a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.\n\nThank you for reading this report.",

Strategy\n\nThe accelerating pace of the climate transition, along with the shaping forces of customers, the community and technology, has led to significant changes to the landscape in which AGL Energy operates. Customers are increasingly demanding distributed energy and carbon neutral products and services; there have been changes in the approach of governments to drive the climate change transition; and rapidly falling renewable generation and energy storage costs have driven increased supply ahead of demand. Further, social and community expectations surrounding climate change, and the pace of the energy transition, have increased significantly. These changes have necessitated a reconsideration of the vertically integrated strategy and operating model that AGL Energy has successfully adopted for many years.\n\n## 2.1 Proposed demerger\n\nIn June 2021, AGL Energy announced its intention to undertake a demerger to create two leading energy businesses with separate listings on the Australian Securities Exchange. Under the demerger proposal, AGL Energy will become Accel Energy Limited ( Accel Energy ), an electricity generation business focused on the accelerating energy transition. Accel Energy will demerge a new entity, AGL Australia Limited ( AGL Australia ), a multi-product energy-led retailing and flexible energy trading, storage and supply business.\n\nAGL Energy sees the demerger as a mechanism to allow both leading businesses to focus on their different but important roles within Australia's transition to a low carbon future. The clarity of purpose for each separate company created by this proposed demerger will protect shareholder value, enabling each business to focus on their respective strategic opportunities and challenges presented by the accelerating energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|            |                                                                                                                                                                                                         | DEMERGER RATIONALE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CUSTOMER   | \u00b7  Demand for distributed energy services accelerating rapidly \u00b7  Demand for carbon neutral products and services \u00b7  Continued role of baseload supply to meet industrial demand                        | \u00b7  Energy requirements of consumer and business users  increasingly different from industrial customers \u00b7  AGL Australia energy needs are aligned with increasing customer  demand for distributed energy and carbon neutral products  \u00b7  Accel Energy empowered to contract directly with large energy  users, industrial partners in energy hub projects |\n| COMMUNITY  | \u00b7  Government intervention via default retail offers and  underwriting of generation \u00b7  Demand for accelerated action on climate change \u00b7  Need for adequate compensation for providing system security | \u00b7  Reducing benefits of integration of retail with baseload  generation relative to costs and complexity  \u00b7  AGL Australia able to use customer scale to underwrite  flexible generation and new renewables projects  \u00b7  Accel Energy to focus on vital role of assets in providing                                                                        |\n| TECHNOLOGY | \u00b7  Rapidly falling costs for renewables and storage driving policy  action to increase supply ahead of demand  \u00b7  Risk/return expectations for new generation development                               | \u00b7  New entities with different funding sources able to attract and deploy capital in more targeted manner technology attractive for transition capital providers                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|            | \u00b7  Strong funding support for renewables and storage  development from non-industry capital providers                                                                                                   | \u00b7  AGL Australia more attractive to capital providers  \u00b7  Accel Energy opportunity to repurpose sites using new                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Accel Energy\n\nAccel Energy will be committed to the acceleration of Australia's decarbonisation while ensuring that energy remains stable and affordable. It will focus on the transition of its existing electricity generation assets and investment in the long-term rejuvenation of its valuable operating sites as low-carbon industrial energy hubs. It will also operate Australia's largest wind portfolio and develop future wind projects. Accel Energy's assets will continue to be required for network stability and capacity in the coming years, while supporting reliability, affordability and the livelihoods of our people and the communities in which they work. It will continue to operate these assets safely and efficiently while alternative sources of energy storage and supply are fully developed.\n\n## AGL Australia\n\nAGL Australia will have an important role to play in supporting the development of renewable generation in Australia. AGL Australia will focus on being Australia's leading multi-product energy retailing business while investing in flexible energy trading, storage and supply and decentralised energy services. AGL Australia will be carbon neutral for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions following the demerger, offsetting the emissions it generates directly with high quality accredited instruments, and will have a clear pathway to full carbon neutrality for its sourced electricity over time via its support for renewables development and further offsets.",

These statements signal our intention for the new businesses to deliver detailed carbon reduction roadmaps with specific decarbonisation targets.\n\nAs Australia's largest electricity generator and largest emitter of greenhouse gases, Accel Energy would embrace the responsibility and opportunities this brings to reinvent its business as the community's reliance on thermal power reduces and, ultimately, ends. It is intended that Accel Energy would work with governments and other key stakeholders and policy decision-makers to advocate for the establishment of effective frameworks to enable an accelerated energy transition that protects affordability and system security, as well as the fair economic interests of its workforce and capital providers. Accel Energy would have a unique opportunity to drive the accelerating transition while creating a sustainable future for its business and the communities in which it operates beyond the life of coal-fired power.\n\nAGL Australia would be Australia's largest multi-product energy retailer, and would lead the transition to a low carbon future. AGL Australia would be carbon neutral for scope 1 and 2 emissions, with a clear pathway to carbon neutrality for all electricity supply following the cessation in the late 2020s of the initial electricity offtake arrangements it proposes to establish with Accel Energy. AGL Australia would work with stakeholders to advocate for reforms that drive the continued uptake and integration of decentralised energy services, electric vehicles, broader demand-side participation, and the development of new flexible generation.\n\n## 2.2 Update on FY24 Strategic Priorities\n\nOver the course of FY21, AGL Energy continued to pursue its three strategic priorities: Growth, Transformation and Social Licence.\n\n- \u00b7 Growth reflected the need for AGL Energy to accelerate investment in new opportunities to meet evolving customer needs. This is especially important as traditional sources of value such as thermal electricity generation decline and will ultimately need to be replaced altogether.\n- \u00b7 Transformation reflected AGL Energy's need to reposition, refresh and reinvigorate the business in a changing world, especially as digital technology continues to alter customers' expectations.\n- \u00b7 Social Licence reflected the need to meet and exceed rising community expectations at a time when we need to rebuild fallen levels of trust in large institutions.\n\n|",

AGL Energy's telecommunication services (AGL Energy and Southern Phone) have increased by 16.7% to 196,301 from 168,237 in FY20, with 11.1% largely driven by AGL Energy branded telecommunication services in operation, and 5.6% attributable to Southern Phone.                                                                                                       | 3.954m |\n| Services per customer                      | 1.6      | 1.5    | Services per customer increased by 0.1 to 1.5, due to growth in dual fuel energy customers as well as growth in the number of customers with bundled energy and telecommunication services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1.4    |\n| RepTrak score                              | >70      | 66.7   | AGL Energy's RepTrak score was 66.7. While this is a 1.4pt decline from the FY20 reported outcome, it does represent an overall positive trend in reputation since FY18. This has been achieved despite the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 as well as significant events during FY21 including the announcement of the proposed demerger, leadership changes, and the recent Greenpeace Australia campaign. Of note, over the last 12 months we have seen increases in key drivers of reputation such as 'governance' and 'leadership'. | 68.3   |\n| Grid-scale batteries installed and managed | 850 MW   | 30 MW  | While the capacity of grid-scale batteries currently installed and managed remains at 30 MW, development activities for several grid-scale batteries are underway, including plans for batteries at AGL Loy Yang, AGL Torrens and at the Liddell Power Station site. This is in addition to the Wandoan and Maoneng battery deals completed in FY20.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 30 MW  |\n| Decentralised assets under orchestration   | 350 MW   | 130 MW | Our multi-asset virtual power plant (VPP) is made up of residential and business customer assets including batteries, demand response and back-up generation. The majority of this capacity reflects curtailable load and diesel generators at our commercial and industrial customer sites and was primarily contracted for the peak summer period to assist managing the AGL Energy position. Over the FY21 period the multi-asset VPP provided over 1 GWh of flexible energy across 50+ events.                                   | 72 MW  |\n\nWhile the establishment and pursuit of these strategic priorities have served AGL Energy well, the significant changes that AGL Energy is facing in its operating environment have led to the proposed demerger of AGL Energy, as outlined above. Separation of AGL Energy into two distinct organisations will enable each business to set and execute its own strategy at a time of great change in the energy industry.\n\n## 2.3 Risk management\n\nAGL Energy's comprehensive, enterprise-wide risk management program, which is aligned with the principles and requirements of the international standard for risk management (ISO 31000), is detailed in the 2021 Corporate Governance Statement\n\n## at agl.com.au/coporategovernance .\n\nThrough this framework, we identify factors that are critical to the successful delivery of our strategy and our ability to create value into the future.\n\n## 2.3.1 FY21 Tier 1 Strategic Risks\n\nWe undertake a comprehensive annual process to assess the key risks to achieving our strategic priorities over the medium term. We define these as Tier 1 Strategic Risks. The Tier 1 Strategic Risks for FY21 are summarised below.\n\nRisk mitigation strategies are in place for each of these risks, and the risks have been monitored throughout FY21 by the Audit & Risk Management Committee.\n\nAGL Energy's risk profile has seen many of its key risks intensify across FY21. Sustained decreases in wholesale electricity pricing, significant state and federal government energy policy announcements, and an acceleration of the forces impacting AGL Energy's response to climate change have significantly impacted AGL Energy's strategic, financial and operational risk profiles. These interrelated forces have been shaping the business risk profile for some time and continue to intensify.\n\nIn addition, and partly as a consequence of these risks, the Board has indicated its intent to separate the business, which will allow the newly formed entities to better address the external threats in the medium term, but may also introduce risk in the short term. Mitigation planning and delivery is ongoing.",

Planned market design rule changes may further impact on electricity pricing and margins going forward.\n- \u00b7 If approved, the separation of AGL Energy into Accel Energy and AGL Australia has the potential to increase risk ( separation execution and organisational culture and capability ) in the period up to the demerger due to the complexity of the execution, and in the period post-demerger as the businesses transition.\n\nRisk level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Tier 1 Strategic Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                 | over FY21   | Relevant Business Value Driver   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| Wholesale market pricing and volatility : AGL is unable to effectively manage the impact of wholesale price changes and market volatility.                                                                            |             |                                  |\n| Government intervention : AGL is not able to effectively anticipate, plan or respond to increasing uncertainty regarding government policy.                                                                           |             |                                  |\n| Climate change response 1 : AGL is unable to meet expectations and/or deliver on its commitments to transition to a low carbon future within an acceptable timeframe.                                                 |             |                                  |\n| Regulatory intervention : AGL is not able to effectively anticipate or plan for regulatory intervention, or added restrictions and diversion of resource puts wider business objectives at risk.                      |             |                                  |\n| Resilience of generation/critical infrastructure 1 : AGL is unable to generate and maintain a resilient energy supply from generation assets and related critical infrastructure.                                     |             |                                  |\n| Organisational culture and capability 1 : AGL is unable to foster a resilient, agile organisation that is built on strong and ethical behaviours, talented people, a focus on safety, and a customer-centric mindset. |             |                                  |\n| Market disruption : AGL does not (or cannot) adequately or appropriately respond to changing customer expectations and preferences regarding energy sources, prices and related products and services.                |             |                                  |\n| Stakeholder trust : AGL's strategy to deliver on its social licence to all stakeholders is unclear, inconsistent, and/or poorly executed.                                                                             |             |                                  |\n| Access to gas : AGL is unable to source sufficient quantities of gas to meet its future demand.                                                                                                                       |             |                                  |\n| Cybersecurity and resilience 1 : AGL's critical systems, platforms and technology infrastructure are compromised by a cyber, vendor or internal event.                                                                |             |                                  |\n| Investment planning and execution 1 : AGL's major investment decisions do not deliver on their intended benefits or outcomes for shareholders, customers and the community.                                           |             |                                  |\n| Compliance and privacy 1 : AGL fails to comply with laws, regulations or other commitments made, including its privacy obligations.                                                                                   |             |                                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 2.3.2 Climate-related risks\n\nAGL Energy has used the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework since 2018 to report on governance, strategy, risks and opportunities and performance in relation to climate change. Our FY21 TCFD Report 'Accelerating Our Transition' (available at agl.com.au/specialreports ) provides a comprehensive breakdown of transition and physical risks and how those risks translate to the proposed Accel Energy and AGL Australia businesses, and includes a high-level assessment of the physical risks to our operated electricity generation assets arising from a warming climate.\n\nFollowing the proposed separation, the climate risk profile for AGL Australia is expected to improve. The most material transition risk to remain for AGL Australia is expected to be increasing reputational risk posed by changing customer and other stakeholder sentiment. AGL Australia would be better positioned to manage this risk through the offsetting of its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, continuing investment in and contracting of renewable energy, and by offering carbon neutral and green products to its customers. The transition to becoming a carbon neutral business could occur faster for AGL Australia than under AGL Energy's current structure.\n\nFor Accel Energy, the material transition risks would be similar to those of AGL Energy, apart from not being directly exposed to reputational risk from retail customer expectations. The remaining risks tend to arise from the rapid transition of the electricity market in Australia, and particularly are attached to the large emissions sources that will form part of Accel Energy's asset base. Being independent from a direct retail customer base and brand would allow Accel Energy to engage effectively with markets and policy makers to ensure a stable operating environment for its assets which supports the accelerated energy transition and also protects affordability and system security.\n\nOne of the key transition risks facing our thermal generation portfolio relates to rehabilitation provisions: faster decarbonisation could see asset closures brought forward, which may result in rehabilitation obligations occurring sooner. In FY21 AGL Energy undertook asset rehabilitation scenario analysis, in the context of the proposed demerger. It is anticipated that Accel Energy would face greater risk than AGL Energy arising from earlier closure scenarios, however the capital structure being considered for Accel Energy is specifically designed to mitigate the risks presented by the potential for earlier occurrence of rehabilitation obligations, especially in the case of early closure scenarios.\n\nThe TCFD Report also includes a more detailed assessment of physical climate risks and their impact upon the National Electricity Market (NEM) as well as location-specific risks across our generation portfolio. This analysis found that AGL Energy's asset portfolio is resilient to direct physical risks in part through its geographic distribution, and also through its technological diversity, which provides increased resilience to the impact of temperature increases on generation efficiency.\n\nThe key direct physical risks faced by AGL Energy's thermal coal fleet are consistent across all assets and include increasing frequency of extreme heat and fire events, as well as water security. The increasing duration and magnitude of heatwaves can reduce generator and network capacity as well as increase failure rates and maintenance costs. As thermal plant capacity decreases under all scenarios, it is anticipated that portfolio growth for both Accel Energy and AGL Australia will be in various renewable and storage technologies thus reducing the impacts of lowered thermal efficiencies to the portfolio.\n\nWater security at thermal coal assets is also an increasing risk. Thermal coal assets use considerable quantities of water and as droughts increase with rising temperatures, water availability and security become increasing risks. AGL Energy's thermal assets have the benefit of a water supply licenced either in perpetuity or while electricity is being generated at the facility. The risk of these licences changing or being withdrawn is assessed as minimal.\n\nAll wind farms in AGL Energy's portfolio tend to face similar physical impacts, however their geographical separation would likely result in impacts not affecting all assets at the same time. Wind generation is also sensitive to any reduction in average wind speed as well as to increases in the frequency and magnitude of destructive gusts. AGL Energy has faced wind-related derating (i.e. decrease in available capacity) from both wind drought and extreme winds in the past, and we consider our broad geographical range of assets to be an effective mitigation strategy for this risk.\n\nThe hydro assets also face water security issues. The changing climate has caused a reduction in average rainfall across much of the NEM, reducing water available for hydro generation and thermal generation cooling consumption as well as increasing power requirements for desalination. At the same time, extreme rainfall events and flooding have increased. In addition to extensive operational expertise, the geographic distribution and diverse water sourcing strategies across the hydro portfolio provide resilience.\n\nThese risks are not unique to AGL Energy and are faced across the energy sector. As the sector continues to transition, the physical impacts of climate change resulting from the effects of existing greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase. Over the coming decades, all businesses in the sector will need to continue to adapt to and mitigate these physical impacts.",

Key Operating Metrics and Business Value Drivers\n\nThe following sections summarise the performance of AGL Energy's business over FY21. Performance is considered through two dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 Key Operating Metrics - These performance measures have a direct influence on AGL Energy's FY21 financial performance. The six key operating metrics comprise:\n- -Customer numbers and churn;\n- -Customer energy demand;\n- -Wholesale electricity prices;\n- -Generation volumes;\n- -Fuel costs; and\n- -Operating costs and capital expenditure.\n- \u00b7 Business Value Drivers - These performance measures are critical to long-term value creation, however may have a less direct relationship to annual performance, and/or may influence financial performance over the longer term. For example, improved customer service, measured through fewer Ombudsman complaints and improved Net Promoter Score (NPS), could lead to higher customer retention and contribute to growth in customer numbers, contributing to future financial performance. The performance measures are divided into scorecards for each of AGL Energy's identified Business Value Drivers.\n\n## 3.1 Key Operating Metrics performance\n\nA summary of performance in relation to the six key operating metrics over FY21 is provided in the following sections.\n\n## 3.1.1 Customer numbers\n\nTotal services to customers increased 6.4% to 4.208 million, from 3.954 million as at 30 June 2020. This increase was largely driven by the acquisition of Click Energy in September 2020, as well as continued organic customer growth through targeted marketing campaigns and the launch of AGL Energy's broadband and mobile phone services.\n\nConsumer Electricity services increased by 162,000 through growth in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Consumer Gas services increased by 64,000 through growth in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia.\n\nTotal broadband, mobile and phone services increased 16.7% to 196,000 following the launch of AGL-branded NBN and mobile offerings.\n\n| Services to customers                      | FY21 ('000)   | FY20 ('000)   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Consumer Electricity                       | 2,465         | 2,303         |\n| New South Wales                            | 916           | 861           |\n| Victoria                                   | 759           | 704           |\n| South Australia                            | 369           | 363           |\n| Queensland                                 | 421           | 375           |\n| Consumer Gas                               | 1,530         | 1,466         |\n| New South Wales                            | 634           | 622           |\n| Victoria                                   | 601           | 559           |\n| South Australia                            | 136           | 132           |\n| Queensland                                 | 86            | 86            |\n| Western Australia                          | 73            | 67            |\n| Total Consumer energy services             | 3,995         | 3,769         |\n| Dual fuel services                         | 2,249         | 2,118         |\n| Average consumer energy services           | 3,947         | 3,734         |\n| Total Large Business energy services       | 17            | 17            |\n| Total energy services                      | 4,012         | 3,786         |\n| Total broadband, mobile and phone services | 196           | 168           |\n| Total AGL Energy services to customers 1   | 4,208         | 3,954         |\n\n|",

Rest of Market churn increased 0.3 ppts to 19.7% from 19.4% reported at 30 June 2020. Overall market churn has increased as the number of customers changing their energy provider has normalised to levels more consistent with before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The gap between AGL Energy and the rest of the market was 5.4 ppts, up from 5.1 ppts at 30 June 2020, reflecting alignment of targeted marketing strategy and market conditions, with increased retentions from movers and fewer customers switching.\n\n## 3.1.2 Customer energy demand\n\nTotal electricity customer sales volumes were 40,567 GWh, up 218 GWh or 0.5%.\n\n- \u00b7 Consumer customer electricity sales volumes were 14,608 GWh, up 768 GWh or 5.5%, largely due to the acquisition of Click Energy customers and growth in solar exports from AGL Energy customers.\n- \u00b7 Large Business customer electricity sales volumes were 10,207 GWh, down 357 GWh or 3.4% due to increased competition and the impact of COVID-19 on demand, partly offset by a full year of Perth Energy volumes.\n- \u00b7 Wholesale customer electricity sales volumes were 15,752 GWh, down 193 GWh or 1.2%, driven by lower consumption from AGL Energy's existing customer base.\n\nFY21\n\nFY20\n\n| Customer energy demand                     | GWh    | GWh    |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Consumer customers electricity sales       | 14,608 | 13,840 |\n| Large Business customers electricity sales | 10,207 | 10,564 |\n| Wholesale customers electricity sales      | 15,752 | 15,945 |\n| Total customer electricity sales volume    | 40,567 | 40,349 |\n\nTotal gas customer sales volumes were 158.4 PJ, up 2.9 PJ or 1.9%.\n\n- \u00b7 Consumer customer gas sales volumes were 55.9 PJ, down 2.3 PJ or 4.0%, due to milder weather and reduction in small business demand, partly offset by an increase in residential customer market share and the inclusion of Click Energy customer volumes in the year.\n- \u00b7 Large Business customer gas sales volumes were 19.4 PJ, up 3.6 PJ or 22.8%, driven by increased consumption from new customers, a full year of Perth Energy volumes and strong acquisition and retention performance.\n- \u00b7 Wholesale customer gas sales and internal gas volumes for power generation were 83.1 PJ, up 1.6 PJ or 2.0%, driven by new customers and higher volumes from existing customers, offset by lower internal gas volumes used for power generation in South Australia due to lower generation in response to lower pool prices.\n\n|                                              |   FY21 PJ |   FY20 PJ |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Consumer customers gas sales                 |      55.9 |      58.2 |\n| Large Business customers gas sales           |      19.4 |      15.8 |\n| Wholesale customers gas sales and generation |      83.1 |      81.5 |\n| Total customer gas sales volume              |     158.4 |     155.5 |\n\n## 3.1.3 Wholesale electricity prices\n\nWholesale electricity spot prices were lower across all states compared with the previous year. Industry supply increased, driven by increased grid-scale and rooftop renewable energy generation, and the deferral of major planned power station outages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. System customer demand decreased, due to mild weather, particularly in summer, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. May and June 2021 had multiple periods of very high electricity prices across New South Wales and Queensland, driven by a combination of high winter demand and lower supply due to multiple planned and unplanned power station outages.\n\nAGL Energy was largely hedged against these electricity spot prices, through its customer load, generation fleet and financial derivatives. Despite the largely hedged position, the average wholesale prices contracted for FY21 were lower than the prior year. AGL Energy's practice of signing contracts on a rolling two to three year forward time frame means that today's lower wholesale prices will translate into lower contracted prices in the future.",

The impact on gas purchases of legacy supply contracts maturing was offset by lower oil prices, with most of AGL Energy's mid- to long-term contracts indexed to oil.\n\n| Total wholesale gas costs   | FY21 $m   | FY20 $m   | FY21 $/GJ   | FY20 $/GJ   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Gas purchases               | (967)     | (950)     | (6.1)       | (6.1)       |\n| Haulage, storage & other    | (347)     | (308)     | (2.2)       | (2.0)       |\n| Total wholesale gas costs   | (1,314)   | (1,258)   | (8.3)       | (8.1)       |\n\n## 3.1.6  Operating costs and capital expenditure\n\nTotal operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) were $(1,619) million, down 1.9%. There were a number of cost increases specific to the year, including the full year impact of Southern Phone Company, step up in costs from the AGL Telecommunications growth and launch, and newly acquired businesses ($47 million), incremental COVID-19 related net bad debt expense, reflecting heightened repayment risk relating to COVID-19, and other customer support initiatives ($9 million), COVID-19 driven reductions in leave taken ($6 million), and expenditure on fully impaired assets that would have historically been treated as capital ($17 million - see Section 4.1.2).\n\nExcluding these specific cost increases , total operating costs were $(1,540) million, down 6.7%. Cost savings were driven by prior year investment in digital transformation initiatives, as the benefit of these initiatives were reflected in the results and the amount of further investment in FY21 was significantly reduced (by $31 million) in addition to further cost out initiatives ($91 million). These savings were partly offset by Enterprise Agreement cost increases ($11 million).\n\n| Operating costs                                                 | FY21 $m   | Restated FY20 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Customer Markets                                                | (517)     | (527)              |\n| Integrated Energy                                               | (790)     | (765)              |\n| Investments                                                     | (2) 1     | -                  |\n| Centrally Managed Expenses                                      | (310)     | (359)              |\n| Total operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (1,619)   | (1,651)            |\n\nTotal capital expenditure was $707 million, an increase of $22 million:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustaining capital expenditure was $534 million, an increase of $27 million. This comprised $363 million of expenditure on AGL Energy's coal-fired plants, up $20 million, driven by deferred outages from FY20 occurring in FY21 at AGL Macquarie, partly offset by the deferral of outage work from FY21 into FY22 at AGL Loy Yang due to COVID-19 related personnel restrictions on site. Other sustaining capital expenditure was $171 million, up $7 million, due to a deferred outage from FY20 occurring in FY21 for Gas Generation.\n- \u00b7 Growth and transformation capital expenditure was $173 million, a decrease of $5 million. In the current year, there was increased spend on systems to support AGL Energy's expansion into the provision of telecommunications services and development of the cancelled LNG import jetty at Crib Point. More than offsetting these increases was the non-recurrence from the prior year of the $62 million completion of construction on the Barker Inlet Power Station.\n\n| Capital expenditure        |   FY21 $m |   Restated FY20 $m |\n|----------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Customer Markets           |        87 |                 69 |\n| Integrated Energy          |       556 |                563 |\n| Centrally Managed Expenses |        64 |                 53 |\n| Total capital expenditure  |       707 |                685 |\n| Sustaining                 |       534 |                507 |\n| Growth and transformation  |       173 |                178 |\n| Total capital expenditure  |       707 |                685 |",

Time series data for the Business Value Driver key performance indicator\n\ns as well as performance data for an extended range of non-financial metrics is available in the FY21 ESG Data Centre. The key performance indicators included in each scorecard should be read in conjunction with the Glossary to the Business Value Drivers on page 187.\n\nTargets for FY21 which were set in the FY20 Annual Report have been noted for relevant key performance indicators, with the assessment of performance against the target indicated according to the legend below. Performance against the FY24 strategic targets which were set in FY20 is also noted. Key performance indicators that are linked to the FY21 remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Key Management Personnel are also identified as outlined in the legend below.\n\n## Legend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Performance meets FY21 target / Performance is on track to meet FY24 target\n- Performance does not meet FY21 target / Performance is significantly off track compared to FY24 target\n\nKPI linked to FY20 remuneration outcomes for\n\nCEO and Key Management Personnel\n\n## 3.2.1 Customer scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nOver FY21, AGL Energy's total services to customers grew to 4.2 million 1 , continuing our expansion as Australia's largest multi-product energy retailer. Energy consumer churn was 14.3%, below the rest of market at 19.7%. Refer to Section 3.1.1 for more details.\n\n## Building trusted customer relationships\n\nAs well as growing services to customers, strong momentum was maintained on the key customer advocacy measure of NPS, reflecting an ongoing commitment to ensuring we put the customer at the centre of everything we do. FY21 saw further growth in strategic NPS of +2.6 points, finishing the year with a score of +4.9, a positive result given the challenges evident in the market throughout the year.\n\nCustomer First, a focused, three-year program to reduce Ombudsman complaints by 50% against FY18 volumes by the end of FY22 delivered significant uplifts to systems, data capture and processes. Direct benefits have flowed through to improve customer experience and reduce complaints, contributing to improved event NPS scores and a 23% reduction in Ombudsman complaints for FY21 compared to FY20 and a 48% reduction against FY18 volumes, nearing our target one year ahead of schedule.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                          | Targets                                         | FY21   | FY20   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net Promoter Score (NPS) | FY21: Targeting continued positive trend in NPS | +4.9   | +2.3   |\n| Ombudsman complaints     | FY21: \u2264 7,731                                   | 5,973  | 7,731  |\n\n## Energy affordability and supporting customers experiencing vulnerability\n\nFY21 commenced with close to 40,000 residential and small business customers being supported by our COVID-19 Support Program and regulatory restrictions on collections activities given the AER's Statement of Expectations for all energy retailers and ESC's written guidance to customers. The recommencement of collections activity (in August for National Energy Customer Framework states and in February 2021 for Victoria) drove an increase in customers seeking support but with higher average arrears given the delay in onboarding to our Staying Connected program. During FY21, over $17 million in debt relief and payment matching was applied to the accounts of customers participating in our Staying Connected program and the net number of customers remained consistent.\n\nAGL Energy's Energy Literacy program dedicated $6 million over three years (FY19-FY21) to initiatives aimed at improving energy education and supporting customers experiencing vulnerability. Through 32 targeted initiatives, AGL Energy has established enduring funding models to help subsidise the cost of energy for the most disadvantaged, provided energy efficiency upgrades and home energy audits for customers on low incomes, installed solar on community housing, helped concession holders complete paperwork to access grants and rebates and commenced a program of work to provide more accessible communications for customers including being the first energy retailer to translate materials into Easy English.\n\n|\n\nPerformance is off track compared to FY24 target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have delivered on this commitment by meeting these key milestones:\n\n- \u00b7 On 1 July 2020, we launched our flagship product, carbon neutral electricity certified by Climate Active. In FY21, 47,000 customers chose to offset the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their electricity use.\n- \u00b7 On 25 November 2020, we expanded carbon neutral options to gas. In FY21, 18,000 customers chose to offset the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their gas use.\n- \u00b7 By the end of June 2021, carbon neutral options were available on all AGL Energy products, including Climate Active certified mobile, telco, solar, batteries and business energy solutions. This includes over 195,000 mobile, internet and home phone services where the greenhouse gas emissions associated with these services are offset for no extra cost.\n\nAGL Energy now has over 260,000 carbon neutral services, including more than 65,000 carbon neutral energy services and 35 commercial and industrial customers. Our carbon neutral customers help support offset projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions. From reforestation in New South Wales to energy efficiency projects in Cambodia, the projects we have chosen provide benefits to local communities in a range of other ways, including employment opportunities, reduced pollution, improved health and financial wellbeing.\n\n## 3.2.2 Communities & Relationships scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Communities & Relationships\n\n## Brand and reputation\n\nAGL Energy's FY21 RepTrak score was 66.7, which was 1.4 points lower than AGL Energy's highest ever recorded reputation score of 68.3 for the same time last year. Overall, AGL Energy has maintained the increase in reputation achieved since FY18 despite the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 as well as significant events during FY21 including the announcement of the proposed demerger, leadership changes, and the recent Greenpeace Australia campaign. Of note, over the last 12 months we have seen increases in key drivers of reputation such as 'governance' and 'leadership'.\n\nIn May 2021 AGL Energy brought legal action against Greenpeace in the Federal Court to stop the use of AGL Energy branding on Greenpeace's ad campaigns which called for the early closure of our coal generators. AGL Energy was granted an injunction relating to some instances of unauthorised use of our logo, and while only partially successful, we maintain that it is reasonable to ask that any third-party use of our logo respects our intellectual property rights. We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with Greenpeace and all other organisations who play a role in holding government and companies to account as part of the transition to a clean energy future. We welcome the opportunity to be part of the public debate and play a leadership role in the clean energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|               | Target    |   FY21 |   FY20 |\n|---------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| RepTrak score | FY24: >70 |   66.7 |   68.3 |\n\n## Transparent policy and industry engagement\n\nIt is important to our stakeholders that our involvement in public policy development is undertaken transparently and consistently. Submissions to government processes are published on AGL Energy's online channel, the Hub . Further, the community expects that corporations should not have an undue level of influence on government policy by providing financial contributions to political parties that could result in, or could be perceived to result in, preferential treatment. We adopted a Political Donations Policy in August 2015, which prohibits AGL Energy from making political donations. No political donations (monetary or in-kind) were made during FY21, nor were any political donations made through third parties.\n\nAGL Energy has an Industry Association Membership Policy which formalises our commitments to monitor the policy positions and public advocacy of industry associations of which we are a member and to disclose all memberships, membership fees, and areas where AGL Energy's policy positions differ materially from the associations of which we are a member. These disclosures are available in the ESG Data Centre .\n\nWe continue to engage with all levels of government as we progress plans for both the closure of Liddell Power Station and the potential redevelopment of the site. In addition, AGL Macquarie has a Community Dialogue Group consisting of stakeholders from local councils, business and industry groups, Traditional Owners and local residents, to ensure there is a formal voice for the community during the Liddell transition.",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## Community contribution and investment\n\nWe invest in the communities in which we operate through a structured program of community investment. During FY21, we commenced a review of these investments as part of our Social Impact Framework development. The aim of the review is to align our investment more closely to AGL's core purpose, capabilities and stakeholder expectations, focusing on fewer areas of investment so we can have greater impact.\n\nOverall community contributions for FY21 were $5.2 million. During FY21, we made improvements to the way in which we account for community contributions, to provide further alignment with the Business for Societal Impact's (B4Si) framework, a recognised global standard for measuring and managing social impact. Aspects of the Energy Literacy Program (refer to Section 3.2.1) as well as the value of Defence Force and Emergency Services volunteering undertaken by our employees have been included in the FY21 data following improvements made to the processes for identifying and gathering social investment data across the organisation. Approximately $1.6 million of management costs are also included, which have not been accounted for in prior years 2 . Naming rights retail sponsorships which were historically included as part of AGL Energy's community contribution are no longer included from FY21 to provide greater alignment with the B4Si framework .\n\nWe continue to engage proactively with the communities where we operate, and have increased our engagement with the Traditional Owners of lands where our sites are located. In FY21, AGL received conditional endorsement for its inaugural Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) from Reconciliation Australia and we expect to publicly launch our RAP later in 2021. The RAP brings together our vision and commitments for reconciliation into one framework with 59 commitments to be delivered over a two-year period (FY22-FY23), with a focus on the reconciliation pillars determined by Reconciliation Australia: Relationships, Respect and Opportunities.\n\nWe are committed to meeting all our tax compliance obligations, and to providing our stakeholders with information about the taxes we pay. In this regard we have adopted the Board of Taxation's voluntary Tax Transparency Code . Our effective tax rate on Underlying Profit is broadly in line with the Australian corporate tax rate of 30%. The effective tax rate has declined for FY21 due to prior year adjustments.\n\n|                               | FY21   | FY20   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Community contribution        | $5.2 m | $4.3 m |\n| Underlying effective tax rate | 27.0%  | 29.1%  |\n\n## 3.2.3 People scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nTIFR for employees and contractors decreased by 30% compared to FY20, however we recognise that there is still more to do to drive our safety performance to zero injuries. Key contributing factors to the injuries sustained included inadequate identification and control of hazards, mind on task/distraction issues and incorrect techniques and work methods used for routine tasks. Based on near-miss incident data, we are also focused on dropped/falling objects, contact with electricity, and uncontrolled release of energy/isolation procedures.\n\nContractor performance has significantly improved in FY21 due to an increased focus on active engagement prior to and during major outages across our operations.\n\n|                                                     | Targets                                      | FY21   | FY20   |    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----|\n| TIFR employees                                      | -                                            | 1.7    | 2.6    |    |\n| TIFR (employees + contractors)                      | FY21: \u2264 3.4, always aiming for zero injuries | 2.3    | 3.3    |    |\n| Fatalities (employees + contractors)                | FY21: 0                                      | 0      | 0      |    |\n| High potential near miss: recordable incident ratio | FY21: \u2265 0.9:1                                | 1.1: 1 | 0.9:1  |    |\n\n## Culture and values\n\nAGL Energy's FY21 engagement score was 62%, down 11 percentage points from 73% in FY20. The decline in employee engagement is reflective of the challenging operating context throughout the year and the uncertainty experienced by our people in relation to the proposed demerger.\n\nThe proportion of females in AGL Energy's senior leadership pipeline (SLP) was 36%, down from 38% last year. There have been numerous restructures and acquisitions that have impacted the overall composition of our workforce. Over the last 12 months we have reviewed gender pay equity twice and the average pay gap for like-for-like roles is 0%.\n\n|",

During FY21 we launched a pilot of the Australian Network on Disability's 'PACE Mentoring Program' at AGL Energy. This involves five mentors from our Disability Working Group volunteering for four months to mentor job seekers and students who identify with disability.\n\nFor the second consecutive year and for the fourth time, in May 2021 AGL Energy was recognised as one of the most inclusive workplaces for LGBTQ+ people in Australia, receiving Gold Employer Status in the 2021 Australian Workplace Equality Index.

Key talent retention was strong throughout FY21, and is reflective of overall retention. However, the uncertainty caused by the proposed demerger and the general negative outlook across the energy industry is currently challenging retention of key senior capabilities and employees across the business.\n\nAGL Macquarie is committed to having no forced employee redundancies as a result of the closure of the Liddell Power Station. We have established the Liddell Transition Team and executive-led functional working groups to support AGL Energy's goals for the transition of the Liddell site and workforce. We have also established the 'Future U Hub' on site at Liddell, from which all employee and contractor support and advice services are delivered, including training and development services; financial planning support; personal, family and career counselling; and individual transition planning such as career transition and outplacement services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                             | Targets    | FY21   | FY20   |\n|-----------------------------|------------|--------|--------|\n| Attrition (total workforce) | -          | 10%    | 9%     |\n| Key talent retention        | FY21: >80% | 95%    | 98%    |\n\n## 3.2.4 Environment scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environment\n\nAGL Energy is committed to reporting in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. AGL Energy's FY21 TCFD Report, 'Accelerating Our Transition', is available at agl.com.au/specialreports . A summary of our approach to climate-related risks is also included in Section 2.3.2 of this report.\n\nAGL Energy's climate commitments are documented through the AGL Climate Statement, released in June 2020. The Climate Statement, which builds upon AGL Energy's Greenhouse Gas Policy (2015), includes our goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and sets out five key climate commitments. A summary of the progress which AGL Energy has made against each commitment during FY21 is available in our FY21 TCFD Report.\n\nAs discussed in Section 2.1, climate transition statements for Accel Energy and AGL Australia have been developed, both of which recognise that the need to take action on climate change is intensifying. These statements, which can be found in the FY21 TCFD Report, signal our intention for the new businesses to deliver detailed climate change roadmaps with specific decarbonisation targets. Transparency remains a central tenet, with both businesses maintaining commitments to continue leading practice in terms of reporting and openly engaging with stakeholders on their transition journeys. To further reinforce this commitment, we recently announced that shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to have their say on the climate reporting for both Accel Energy and AGL Australia at the first Annual General Meeting for each organisation. AGL Energy has a proven track record of market leading disclosure and this commitment ensures that this legacy of transparency and engagement will be a foundation of both new entities.\n\nIn our FY20 TCFD Report 'Pathways to 2050', we provided detailed scenario analysis of potential future carbon reduction pathways to understand the long-term implications for AGL Energy's generation fleet, customers, and the NEM more broadly.\n\nDuring FY21, we examined the FY20 scenario analysis in the context of the rapidly changing market environment. The four scenarios that were modelled remain relevant, however changes arising from lower wholesale electricity prices, government policy directions and the COVID-19 pandemic over FY21 indicate that a faster climate transition pathway is now becoming the most dominant scenario.",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nDuring FY21 we also considered the implications of the FY20 scenario analysis for the proposed Accel Energy and AGL Australia businesses. The emissions trajectories under the modelled scenarios remain materially similar for AGL Energy and the proposed Accel Energy business, while AGL Australia's emissions would be significantly reduced and largely a function of more variable peaking generation assets.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nAGL Energy's total greenhouse gas emissions decreased in FY21, primarily due to reduced generation from Liddell and Bayswater power stations resulting from increased outages. This was partly offset by increased generation from AGL Loy Yang relative to FY20 when the major outage of Unit 2 constrained output. Generation from AGL Torrens also decreased, due to the mothballing of its A2 and A4 units as Barker Inlet Power Station had its first full year of operation. While renewable generation also increased, the overall emissions intensity of generation increased due to the increased output from AGL Loy Yang which has the highest emissions intensity of AGL Energy's assets.\n\nThe mothballing of two units at AGL Torrens contributed to a slight increase in the proportion of AGL Energy's controlled generation capacity that is renewable or electricity storage, however several grid-scale batteries are under development (refer to Section 3.2.5 for more details).\n\nThe emissions intensity of total revenue has increased as a result of declining revenue in FY21. The increase in revenue from green energy and carbon neutral products is driven by residential solar revenue and carbon neutral products, partly offset by decreased pool revenue from renewable generation in FY21. Further information in relation to carbon neutral products is available in Section 3.2.1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Operated scope 1 & 2 emissions (MtCO2e)                   | Targets FY50: Net zero                                                            |   FY21 40.8 |   FY20 42.7 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Controlled generation intensity (tCO2e/MWh)               | FY21: Improvement on FY20, consistent with objectives of the FY21 LTI FY24: 0.845 |       0.951 |       0.931 |\n| Controlled renewable and battery capacity (%)             | FY21: Improvement on FY20, consistent with objectives of the FY21 LTI             |      23     |      22.5   |\n| Emissions intensity of total revenue (ktCO2e/$m)          | -                                                                                 |       3.7   |       3.5   |\n| Revenue from green energy and carbon neutral products (%) | FY21: Improvement on FY20, consistent with objectives of the FY21 LTI FY24: 20%   |      13.4   |      11.5   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rehabilitation\n\nAGL Energy is committed to providing ongoing, transparent disclosure in relation to our approach to the progressive and final rehabilitation of assets at the end of their operational lives. AGL Energy has recently completed a review of our long-term rehabilitation obligations, in line with commitments made in the 2017 Rehabilitation Report. At the same time, the discount rate used to derive the present value of the estimated cash flows was reduced from 10% to 3%, consistent with standard accounting practice. The review resulted in an increase in the provision for environmental restoration of $1,112 million, which was reflected in AGL Energy's financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2020.\n\nAGL Energy currently undertakes progressive rehabilitation activities across a number of operational sites. These progressive rehabilitation activities cover AGL Energy's obligations to:\n\n- \u00b7 progressively rehabilitate the parts of the Loy Yang Mine that do not impact ongoing production;\n- \u00b7 manage and progressively cap ash dams and voids at AGL Macquarie; and\n- \u00b7 progressively decommission gas wells that have ceased production in the upstream gas portfolio.\n\nThe updated provision accounts for an increase in the scope and cost of the above progressive rehabilitation activities. Further, additional works are now required to meet AGL Energy's end-state compliance obligations, which have increased due to a combination of both updated regulatory requirements and the establishment of formal closure plans as some assets approach end of life. These additional works will result in an increase in the cost to deliver AGL Energy's rehabilitation program. The key drivers of increases in the estimated costs are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 an increase in the lake level, shoreline and associated mine battering for the Loy Yang Mine, in line with AGL Energy's latest rehabilitation plan and the Latrobe Valley Regional Rehabilitation Strategy;\n- \u00b7 an increase in the estimated area and restoration efforts required for both the Liddell ash dam and Ravensworth void at AGL Macquarie in line with committed rehabilitation plans;\n- \u00b7 an increase in the estimated work required to decommission gas wells at both Camden and in the Surat Basin, aligning to Codes of Practice in NSW and Queensland; and\n- \u00b7 inclusion of additional project management costs to align with an owner-led delivery model, ensuring that AGL Energy oversees delivery of its obligations.\n\n|",

Progressive rehabilitation of ash dams and mines associated with AGL Energy's coal generation assets, as well as decommissioning and rehabilitation of gas production wells undertaken in FY21, is outlined in the ESG Data Centre .\n\n## Other environmental risks\n\nThe number of environmental regulatory reportable (ERR) incidents in FY21 increased to 11 from nine in FY20. Four of the 11 ERR events in FY21 were community complaints in relation to visible dust at Loy Yang Mine during periods of very high winds.\n\nAGL Energy received two official cautions and two penalty infringement notices (PINs) for events that occurred in FY21. AGL Energy also entered into an Enforceable Undertaking with the NSW Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) for an event that occurred on 4 September 2019 (FY20). Further details relating to these PINs, as well as other EPA matters, are included in the Environmental regulation section.\n\nThe New South Wales and Victorian EPAs have now completed their reviews of the Environmental Protection Licences (EPL) for all coal-fired power stations in Victoria and New South Wales.\n\n- \u00b7 Bayswater Power Station and Liddell Power Station - The review includes several changes, including reductions to the emissions limits for Sulphur Oxides, Nitrogen Oxides and Particulates, the addition of continuous monitoring for particulate matter and additional quality assurance requirements associated with emission monitoring systems.\n- \u00b7 Loy Yang A Power Station - the Victorian EPA has concluded its review of Loy Yang's EPL and issued the amended licence on 5 March 2021. Key changes include reduction of emission limits for existing parameters, introduction of limits for mercury and fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), introduction of daily and monthly public reporting of air emissions data, requirements to complete 12-month monitoring programs for Class 3 Indicators (hazardous pollutants) and fine particulate matter, and requirements to develop additional monitoring and management plans. The amended limits took effect on 1 June 2021 and an implementation program is in place to ensure all new licence conditions are complied with by the required dates.\n\n|                                               |   FY21 |   FY20 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Environmental Regulatory Reportable incidents |     11 |      9 |\n\n## 3.2.5 Infrastructure scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nAGL's operated generation capacity as of 30 June 2021 was 10,984 MW. A map of AGL Energy's assets is available in Section 1.1. The output from our electricity generation portfolio is outlined in Section 3.1.4.\n\n## Generation efficiency and availability\n\nAGL Energy's Equivalent Availability Factor in FY21 was lower than in FY20 as a result of an extensive planned outage program, led by the largest maintenance outage works ever undertaken at Bayswater Power Station. Accompanying this was good operational performance across other parts of AGL Energy's fleet. For example, Loy Yang A Power Station delivered its strongest availability result in the past five years. Bayswater Power Station had significantly lower boiler tube leak downtime as a result of the implementation of a boiler tube leak reduction program. Liddell Power Station's overall output was lower compared to last year, primarily due to a generator transformer issue that caused an extended outage. We are continuing to focus on maintaining predictable performance at Liddell Power Station in FY22 throughout transition to retirement.\n\nProgrammed energy efficiency uplifts have been delivered at Bayswater Power Station as part of the FY21 planned outage schedule. This has included plant design modifications to enable online maintenance of feedwater heaters, ensuring generation performance and minimising site emissions intensity. Work has also been performed on improving coal boiler efficiency thus further reducing plant emissions intensity. In FY22 similarly scoped programs are being deployed on adjacent Bayswater units.",

During FY21 we continued our strong track record of investing in renewable and peaking generation as well as energy storage projects:\n\n- \u00b7 Through our investment in Powering Australian Renewables (PowAR), we contributed $357.6 million to fund the acquisition of Tilt Renewables' Australian business. The acquisition was completed in August 2021.\n- \u00b7 Development activities for several grid-scale batteries are underway, including plans for batteries at AGL Loy Yang, AGL Torrens and at the Liddell Power Station site. This is in addition to the two major battery deals that were completed in FY20, comprising a 15-year agreement with Vena Energy for full operational dispatch rights for the 100 MW Wandoan Battery in Queensland commencing in October 2021, and an innovative derivative agreement with the Maoneng Group to secure capacity on four 50 MW batteries in New South Wales which will be operational from 2023.\n- \u00b7 We have made a $5 million equity investment in RayGen. RayGen is an Australian solar power and renewable energy storage company that aims to develop Australia's largest, most innovative and lowest-cost renewable energy storage project. RayGen is in the construction phase of its first project at Carwarp in Victoria and AGL has agreed to be the offtaker and dispatcher of the plant's output and storage. In addition, we are undertaking a pre-feasibility to locate a project on the Liddell Power Station site.\n\nWe also continue to invest in our orchestration platform for the management of decentralised assets. Our multi-asset virtual power plant (VPP) is made up of residential and business customer assets including batteries, demand response and back-up generation. The majority of this capacity reflects curtailable load and diesel generators at our commercial and industrial customer sites and was primarily contracted for the peak summer period to assist managing our position. Over the FY21 period the multi-asset VPP provided over 1 GWh of flexible energy across 50+ events. Decentralised assets under orchestration rose from 72 MW in FY20 to 130 MW in FY21, on track to meeting a target of 350 MW in FY24.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                            | Targets      | FY21   | FY20   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|--------|\n| Grid-scale batteries installed and managed | FY24: 850 MW | 30 MW  | 30 MW  |\n| Decentralised assets under orchestration   | FY24: 350 MW | 130 MW | 72 MW  |\n\nIn May 2021, AGL Energy confirmed that we would cease any further development of the proposed liquified natural gas import jetty at Crib Point. This followed the Independent Advisory Committee findings and the Victorian Planning Minister's determination in March 2021 that the project would have unacceptable environmental impacts. AGL Energy has a highly flexible gas portfolio and a supply strategy which will enable customer demand to be met from existing and new domestic supply sources and proposed third party regasification projects, leveraging LNG supply options that were developed for the original Crib Point project.\n\n## Liddell Power Station transition\n\nWe remain committed to not extending the technical life of our coal-fired power plants and have made a strong commitment to driving the decarbonisation of the energy sector and the continued investment in new renewable and near-zero emissions technologies. The first of our coal-fired power stations to close will be Liddell Power Station, which will close units progressively in FY22 and FY23. As we enter the final two years of operations at Liddell, we are progressing with decoupling shared infrastructure and controls that support both the Liddell and Bayswater power station operations and continue to detail unit retirement and Liddell decommissioning plans. We have commenced detailed closure, demolition and rehabilitation scoping that supports the submission of our Station Closure and Ash Dam Closure plans.\n\nAGL Energy is currently undertaking transition planning to support the redevelopment of the Liddell precinct into an Energy Hub following the closure of the power station. AGL Energy also plans to develop a 500 MW grid-scale battery at the site, which is part of the 850 MW multi-site integrated battery system that AGL Energy aims to develop by FY24. Our focus continues to be on supporting our people and local communities through this change (refer to Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3).\n\nAGL Energy is working with Delta Group on the first stage of closure planning, decommissioning and demolition methodology scoping. AGL Energy's transition program is about ensuring the safety of our people and preparing other sources of generation to continue delivering reliable electricity. We are continuing to work on a number of plans for the Liddell site as we develop an Energy Hub which include options such as battery storage, waste to energy, solar thermal and storage, an energy industrial park, and a logistics and rail hub.\n\n|",

We have developed a leading data and analytics ecosystem that connects millions of distributed assets and data points, ensuring our data is trusted, protected and readily accessible. Advanced solutions provide deeper insights across AGL Energy, enabling optimised generation performance, new customer experiences and products.\n\nOne example is the machine learning capabilities embedded at our thermal assets to improve reliability and availability, including the installation of algorithms to optimise asset performance. We have also prototyped predictive algorithms to scan operating conditions and detect non-optimised performance to prevent plant constraints. In addition, automated data processes were implemented to comply with the new EPA General Environmental Duty, introduced in June.\n\nWe are also innovating and investing in new digital data led services for customers, recently launching performance monitoring for solar customers which flags potential faults and offers troubleshooting via the app and web.\n\n## System capabilities to optimise experience\n\nAGL Energy has undertaken a number of initiatives to increase the percentage of Digital Active customers, including: optimising existing and new customer communications to have a digital focus; launching nbn and mobile functionality within the AGL app and MyAccount; integrating systems to allow the smooth flow of customer information between SAP and our digital service assets; creating new, and enhancing existing, campaigns to increase awareness of our online channels and their features; introducing new payment support features within MyAccount and the AGL app; and successfully onboarding Click Energy customers to AGL Energy's digital service assets.\n\nWe have also invested to transform the large commercial and industrial customer digital experience, launching the Business Customer Portal and enhancing our digital progressive purchasing product. With over 4,500 registered enterprises representing more than 180,000 sites, the digital platform enables customers to seamlessly interact with their account to manage and access site information, billing, usage and enhanced reporting data.\n\nEven with the variable environment of COVID-19 and working from home, IT system stability was good throughout FY21. However, the increased rate of change and increased service complexity, driven in part by the introduction of new products and services such as NBN/Telco, have driven a corresponding increase in the number of major IT incidents. Investments in FY21 have focused on transformation of applications into cloud to improve cybersecurity, reduce end-of-life risk and leverage the flexibility of the public cloud. The cloud transformation has been underpinned by a broad skills uplift through AGL Energy's internal Cloud Academy training programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                               | Targets   | FY21   | FY20   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Major IT incidents                            | -         | 52     | 33     |\n| Digitally active energy services to customers | FY24: 65% | 50.4%  | 43.7%  |\n\n## Data security and process governance\n\nAGL Energy collects large volumes of data from and about our customers to provide our products and services and to comply with the law. We recognise that customer data protection and privacy is critical to both our customers and our operations, and our Privacy Policy is designed to drive consistency to ensure that privacy is at the forefront of everything we do. We have targeted improvements in privacy and data management over the last 12 months, including a focus on data governance, classification and retention to better integrate the management of data and technology through a lens of customer privacy.\n\nDuring FY21 we had no notifiable data breaches under the Privacy Act 1988 Mandatory Data Breach Reporting regime.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                              | Targets   |   FY21 |   FY20 |\n|------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Reportable privacy incidents | FY21: 0   |      0 |      1 |\n\n## Modern Slavery\n\nIn December 2020, AGL Energy published our first Modern Slavery Act Statement for FY20, detailing AGL Energy's modern slavery governance framework, a summary of AGL Energy's modern slavery risks inherent within our operations and supply chains, and various mitigation and remediation strategies.

A post-tax impairment loss of $10 million was recognised as a Significant Item in the year.\n- \u00b7 On 2 September 2019, completed the purchase of 100% of the outstanding share capital of Perth Energy Holdings Pty Ltd. Acquisition related transaction costs of $7 million post-tax were recognised as a Significant Item in the year.\n\n## 4.1.3 Change in accounting policy\n\nFollowing clarifying guidance from the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), AGL Energy adopted a change in accounting policy in relation to the treatment of configuration and customisation costs related to cloud computing arrangements, commonly referred to as Software as a Service. Under the revised accounting policy, costs that would have been previously capitalised are treated as operating expenditure where the entity cannot demonstrate the ability to control the relevant software. In accordance with Australian Accounting Standards the change in accounting policy has been adopted retrospectively and prior comparative periods have been restated.

This was largely driven by a full year of depreciation of FY20 Customer Markets capital expenditure on digital uplift and regulatory system upgrades, and an increase attributable to AGL Energy's capitalisation of costs relating to an exit of applications out of data centres and migration into cloud.\n\nNet finance costs were $(224) million, up 25.1% largely driven by the embedded interest cost unwinding from the onerous contracts and rehabilitation provisions recognised at 31 December 2020.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nThe impacts to Underlying Profit before tax were partially offset by a 37.6% reduction in Underlying tax expense to $199 million, primarily reflecting the decrease in profit. The underlying effective tax rate was 27.1%, a decrease of 1.2 ppts.\n\n## 4.1.6 Change in fair value of financial instruments\n\n## Approach to hedging\n\nAGL Energy's approach to managing energy price risks, through physical ownership of energy generation, contracting for energy supply and financial hedging, reflects the need to provide pricing certainty to customers and limit exposure to adverse wholesale market outcomes. AGL Energy generates electricity or has contracted gas supply in excess of its customers' demand in some states. In other states, AGL Energy has sources of supply less than its customers' demand.\n\nAGL Energy uses certain financial instruments (derivatives) to manage these energy price risks and to manage its exposure to interest and foreign exchange rates arising in the normal course of business, provided the overall AGL Energy risk appetite is not exceeded. The majority of these financial instruments exchange a fixed price for a floating market-based price of a given commodity, interest rate, currency or a quoted asset, with the net differential being settled with the counterparty. AGL Energy is exposed to price volatility on the sale and purchase of energy-related commodities in the normal course of business, and therefore enters into contracts that minimise the price risk to AGL Energy on both sold and purchased forecast exposures.\n\nAGL Energy has in place a governance framework that establishes the policy guidelines under which energy hedging activities are conducted. Key components of that policy include segregation of duties, independent risk oversight, earnings-at-risk limits, compliance management and regular reporting to the Board. The risk policy represents the Board's and Senior Management's commitment to an effective risk management function to ensure appropriate management and oversight of AGL Energy's risks related to wholesale markets energy risk. The policy allows for commercial optimisation of the portfolio provided that AGL Energy adheres to overall earnings-at-risk limits that reflect its risk appetite.\n\n## Energy price risk\n\nCertain purchased contracts traded prior to 1 July 2019 are designated as hedge relationships when they can be matched to forecast transactions with sufficient probability of the forecast transaction occurring. Derivative instruments assigned to an effective hedge relationship have movements in fair value deferred to an equity hedge reserve until the transactions to which those instruments are matched occur. Derivative instruments not assigned to an effective hedge relationship have movements in fair value recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAGL Energy's energy-related derivatives assigned to hedge relationships are purchased derivative contracts, where AGL Energy pays a fixed price in exchange for a floating price received from the counterparty. The energy-related derivatives recognised in profit or loss are net-sold positions, where AGL Energy receives a fixed price from a counterparty in exchange for a floating price paid to the counterparty.\n\nAGL Energy is required to make margin payments in respect of futures contracts traded through the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Initial margin call payments are made at the time contracts are entered in order to manage intra-day credit exposure. The quantum of initial margin depends on the volume traded, the expected market volatility as well as forward electricity prices at the time. The initial margin call can move subsequently as forward prices move. AGL Energy also receives or makes payments known as variation margin calls, which cover mark to market movements of AGL Energy's open futures position. These typically reverse through future earnings as contract positions roll off.\n\n## Treasury related risk\n\nAGL Energy's treasury related risk primarily relates to interest and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Contracts to minimise the exposure to market-based fluctuations are executed pursuant to AGL Energy's treasury risk management policy. These contracts primarily result in fixed interest and foreign currency rates. These contracts are designated in hedge relationships when they can be matched to forecast transactions with sufficient probability of the forecast transaction occurring.\n\nIn addition to the above, AGL Energy is counterparty to cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements to convert its fixed interest rate US dollar private placement borrowing instruments to floating interest rate Australian dollar equivalent borrowing instruments. The cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements are designated as fair value and cash flow hedge relationships.\n\n## Movement in fair value\n\nThe initial fair value of a derivative is the consideration paid or received (the premium). Fair value movements in any given period are a function of changes to underlying indices, market prices or currencies and the roll-off of realised contractual volumes or amounts. A reconciliation of the movements in financial instruments carried at fair value for FY21 is presented in the following table.",

This net gain reflected a positive fair value movement in AGL Energy's net sold electricity derivative contracts as a result of lower electricity forward prices and a positive fair value movement in net purchased oil and coal derivative contracts as a result of higher oil and coal forward prices.\n- \u00b7 Certain purchased energy derivatives previously designated in a hedge relationship expired by 30 June 2021 (movement of $30 million).\n- \u00b7 Currency related fair value loss of $(145) million recognised in borrowings. This related primarily to the appreciation of the AUD/USD foreign exchange rate, and an increase of AUD yield curve. The $42 million movement in hedge reserve was largely driven by the increase in the AUD forward curve.\n\n|",

Working capital movements were $36 million, compared with $438 million in the prior year. Components of working capital movement were:\n\n- \u00b7 Receivables cash flow of $12 million reflected a reduction in customer receivables due to reduced average customer prices driven by customers switching to lower-priced products, continued impacts of the introduction of regulated default offers, price decreases following the decrease in wholesale costs and improved collection of debts to pre-COVID-19 levels. This was partly offset by a receivable recognised for the fees paid to the Clean Energy Regulator following the under surrender of 2020 Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs). The fees will be recovered in future years following the surrender of additional LGCs in those years. The prior year cash flow of $60 million reflected a partial year impact of the introduction of regulated default offers in each state and customers switching to lower-priced products.\n- \u00b7 Payables cash flow of $150 million reflected higher electricity prices across May and June on net derivative and AEMO balances, increased volumes and higher contract prices relating to gas purchases, leading to higher accounts payable balances at June. Payables also increased due to the contracts to purchase LGCs in future periods to satisfy the 2020 surrender obligations. The prior year cash flow of $(156) million reflected lower electricity pool prices and timing of contract positions combined with lower coal payables due to reduced coal deliveries.\n- \u00b7 Inventory cash flow of $(1) million reflected the inclusion of Solgen and Epho inventory balances, largely offset by a lower weighted average cost of coal due to a higher portion of coal delivered from legacy contracts. The prior year cash flow of $(14) million reflected an increase in spare parts inventory partly offset by a lower coal stockpile at AGL Macquarie.\n- \u00b7 Financial assets (margin calls) cash flow of $(17) million reflected an increase in initial margin and variation margin requirements driven by an increase in the volume of ASX trades, the increase in forward curves across the last quarter of the year as well as the roll-off of derivatives with positive mark to market value. This was partly offset by a change in calculation of initial margin which reduced the initial margin requirement. The prior year cash flow reflected a net cash inflow of variation margin calls due to a decrease in the electricity forward curve during FY20.\n- \u00b7 Green assets and liabilities cash flow of $(81) million reflected higher certificate purchases in response to expected increases in scheme compliance percentages. The prior year cash flow of $47 million reflected a higher LGC scheme compliance percentage as well as the impact of certificates purchased in FY19 and surrendered in FY20.\n\nThe onerous contracts cash flow of $(80) million reflected the onerous portion of payments made to suppliers under legacy wind farm offtake agreements and Yabulu PPA and Gas Transport Agreements (GTAs), previously recognised as onerous. The prior year cash flow of $(30) million reflects the onerous portion of payments related to Yabulu PPA and GTAs.",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nThe movement in other assets/liabilities of $(30) million largely related to payments for rehabilitation works. The prior year cash flow of $44 million largely related to movements in employee related provisions.\n\nCash tax paid during FY21 was lower than FY20, in line with lower profit before tax and utilisation of prior year tax losses.\n\nInvesting cash flow of $(937) million reflected capital expenditure and the acquisitions of Click Energy, Solgen and Epho. The prior year Investing cash flow of $(835) million reflected capital expenditure, and the Perth Energy and Southern Phone Company acquisitions. For further details on capital expenditure, see Section 3.1.6.\n\nFinancing cash flow of $(366) million included dividend payments of $(573) million and a net borrowings drawdown of $212 million. The prior year cash flow of $(1,252) million included dividend payments of $(719) million, share buy-back of $(620) million and a net borrowings drawdown of $94 million.\n\n## 4.3 Financial position\n\n## Summary Statement of Financial Position\n\nAt 30 June 2021 AGL Energy's total assets were $15,450 million, an increase from $14,607 million at 30 June 2020, primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets and property plant and equipment reflecting the increase in the estimated environmental rehabilitation costs. The increase in estimated environmental rehabilitation costs follows the alignment of the discount rates used for rehabilitation cash flows with latest market practice and the substantial completion of a periodic review of future rehabilitation requirements. This was partly offset by an impairment loss on property plant and equipment and intangible assets (refer to Section 4.1.2).\n\nTotal liabilities at 30 June 2021 were $9,944 million, an increase from $6,635 million at 30 June 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in provisions for environmental rehabilitation as mentioned above and onerous contracts (refer to Section 4.1.2).\n\nTotal equity at 30 June 2021 was $5,506 million, down from $7,972 million, reflecting the Statutory Loss for the period and dividends paid. AGL Energy's return on equity, calculated on a rolling 12-month basis was 8.1%, down from 30 June 2020.\n\n|                               | FY21 $m   | Restated FY20 $m   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Assets                        |           |                    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents     | 88        | 141                |\n| Other current assets          | 3,587     | 2,981              |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 6,283     | 6,640              |\n| Intangible assets             | 3,302     | 3,638              |\n| Other non-current assets      | 2,190     | 1,207              |\n| Total assets                  | 15,450    | 14,607             |\n| Liabilities                   |           |                    |\n| Borrowings                    | 3,185     | 3,108              |\n| Other liabilities             | 6,759     | 3,527              |\n| Total liabilities             | 9,944     | 6,635              |\n| Net assets/total equity 1     | 5,506     | 7,972              |\n\n## Net debt reconciliation\n\nNet debt at 30 June 2021 was $2,997 million, up from $2,723 million at 30 June 2020 due to increased debt facility drawdowns following acquisitions.\n\nAGL Energy's gearing (measured as the ratio of net debt to net debt plus adjusted equity) at 30 June 2021 was 35.1% compared with 25.3% at 30 June 2020.\n\nAGL Energy maintained its credit rating of Baa2 throughout the period as provided by Moody's Investors Service. Key metrics consistent with this credit rating at 30 June 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest cover: 9.0 times\n- \u00b7 Funds from operations to net debt: 30.7%\n\nAGL Energy's funds from operations has been calculated with a similar methodology to Moody's whereby the movement in all current and non-current tax assets and liabilities is treated as working capital.\n\n|",

Segmental Analysis\n\nAGL Energy manages its business in three key operating segments: Customer Markets, Integrated Energy and Investments. Further detail on the activities of each operating segment is provided below.\n\nAGL Energy manages and reports a number of expense items including Information Technology under Centrally Managed Expenses. These costs are not reallocated to AGL Energy's operating segments because their management is the responsibility of various corporate functions.\n\nEffective 1 July 2020, AGL Energy formed the Integrated Energy operating segment. Integrated Energy reflects the consolidation of the previous Wholesale Markets and Group Operations operating segments, adjusted for any intra-segment transactions.\n\n## 5.1 Customer Markets\n\n## 5.1.1 Underlying EBIT\n\nCustomer Markets Underlying EBIT was $203 million, up 16.7% due to higher gross margin and lower operating costs, partly offset by higher depreciation and amortisation. Investment in digital transformation in prior years, together with a continued focus on efficiencies, helped absorb the increased operating costs associated with the full year impact of Southern Phone Company (acquired in December 2019), growth and launch of AGL Telecommunications and the successful acquisitions of Click Energy, Solgen and Epho, and increased net bad debt expense due to COVID-19.\n\nThe increase in gross margin was driven by an increase in Consumer Gas gross margin due to higher revenue rates, and the margin associated with the acquisition of Click Energy, which was fully integrated into Customer Markets on 1 April 2021. This was partially offset by a decrease in Consumer Electricity gross margin due to customers switching to lower-priced products.\n\nConsumer Electricity and Consumer Gas services increased by 162,000 and 64,000 respectively from 30 June 2020 to 30 June 2021. The increase in gross margin from the growth in Consumer Electricity services was offset by an increased uptake of lower priced products. Excluding the operating costs associated with the full year impact of Southern Phone Company, growth and launch of AGL Telecommunications, the acquisitions of Click Energy, Solgen and Epho, and the impact of the COVID-19 net bad debt expense, operating costs were down $64 million, or 13.0%.\n\n|                                                           | FY21 $m   | Restated FY20 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Consumer Electricity gross margin                         | 478       | 500                |\n| Consumer Gas gross margin                                 | 256       | 219                |\n| Large Business Electricity gross margin                   | 34        | 36                 |\n| Large Business Gas gross margin                           | 10        | 12                 |\n| Fees, charges and other gross margin                      | 20        | 20                 |\n| Telecommunications gross margin                           | 9         | 6                  |\n| Perth Energy gross margin                                 | 14        | 25                 |\n| Click Energy gross margin 1                               | 30        | -                  |\n| Solgen/Epho gross margin                                  | 3         | -                  |\n| Gross margin                                              | 854       | 818                |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (517)     | (527)              |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                         | 337       | 291                |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                             | (134)     | (117)              |\n| Underlying EBIT                                           | 203       | 174                |",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Consumer Gas gross margin was $256 million, up 16.9%, driven by higher revenue rates in New South Wales and Victoria. Consumer Gas volumes were down 4.0%, driven by milder weather and reduction in small business demand, partly offset by an increase in residential customer market share and the inclusion of Click Energy customer volumes in the year.\n- \u00b7 Large Business Electricity gross margin was $34 million, down 5.6% due to the impacts of increased competition and COVID-19 on consumption.\n- \u00b7 Large Business Gas gross margin was $10 million, down 16.7%, as lower wholesale gas costs were passed on to customers, partly offset by volume growth.\n- \u00b7 Fees, charges and other gross margin was $20 million, flat on prior year.\n- \u00b7 Telecommunications gross margin was $9 million, up 50.0%, due to a full year of telecommunications gross margin in the year compared with six months in the prior year, with the Southern Phone acquisition taking place in December 2019 and the launch of AGL Telecommunications during FY21. Southern Phone gross margin was impacted by additional investment in network-to-network upgrade work and a shift in customer mix from voice to internet services.\n- \u00b7 Perth Energy gross margin was $14 million, down 44.0% due to lower generation from forced outages, which limited the ability to hedge against higher wholesale costs and resulted in margin compression. This was partly offset by electricity and gas volumes increasing by 41.7% and 134.0% respectively compared with the prior year due to the inclusion of a full year of volumes and increased customer acquisition and retentions.\n- \u00b7 Click Energy gross margin reflects results from acquisition in September 2020 to March 2021. It includes retailing of electricity and gas to residential and small business customers, and connections margin from the On the Move business. Click Energy was fully integrated into Customer Markets on 1 April 2021 within Consumer Electricity and Consumer Gas.\n- \u00b7 Solgen and Epho gross margin since acquisition includes solar engineering, procurement, construction and asset maintenance services and distribution sales of wholesale solar components.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation and amortisation was $(134) million, up 14.5% due to a full year of depreciation on capital expenditure spent during FY20 on digital uplift and regulatory system upgrades.\n\n## 5.1.2 Operating costs\n\nCustomer Markets operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) were $(517) million, down 1.9%. There were a number of cost increases specific to the year, including those related to the full year impact of Southern Phone Company, growth and launch of AGL Telecommunications, the step up in costs from the acquisition of Click Energy, Solgen and Epho, and an increase in net bad debt expense reflecting heightened repayment risk relating to COVID-19 and the COVID-19 payment support program.\n\nExcluding these specific cost increases , total operating costs were down $64 million, or 13.0%. Cost savings were largely driven by prior year investment in digital transformation initiatives and Customer Experience transformation programs, as the benefit of these initiatives were reflected in the results, including lower call volumes and increases in digital sales. Costs directly associated with investing in these programs were also reduced. Partly offsetting these savings were incremental costs to service the increase in average services to customers.\n\n|                                                           | FY21 $m   | Restated FY20 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Labour and contractor services                            | (191)     | (185)              |\n| Net bad debt expense                                      | (127)     | (119)              |\n| Campaigns and advertising                                 | (98)      | (103)              |\n| Other expenditure                                         | (101)     | (120)              |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (517)     | (527)              |\n| Add: depreciation and amortisation                        | (134)     | (117)              |\n| Operating costs (including depreciation and amortisation) | (651)     | (644)              |\n\n- \u00b7 Net bad debt expense was $(127) million, up 6.7% driven by net bad debt expense due to COVID-19, to reflect heightened repayment risk relating to COVID-19 and discounted settlements for impacted small business and large business customers, and for Click Energy. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 net bad debt expense and FY21 acquisitions, net bad debt expense was $(93) million, down 5.1%.\n- \u00b7 Campaigns and advertising costs were $(98) million, down 4.9%, due to cost reductions achieved through digital investments. Excluding the full year impact of Southern Phone Company and the impact of the launch of AGL Telecommunications, campaigns and advertising costs were $(88) million, down 12.0%.\n\n|",

Overall market churn has increased as the number of customers changing their energy provider has normalised to levels more consistent with before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## 5.2 Integrated Energy\n\nEffective 1 July 2020, AGL Energy formed the Integrated Energy operating segment. Integrated Energy reflects the consolidation of the previous Wholesale Markets and Group Operations operating segments, adjusted for any intra-segment transactions.\n\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Electricity reflects the procurement of key fuel inputs and hedging of AGL Energy's wholesale electricity requirements, and also includes Eco Markets, which reflects the management of AGL Energy's liabilities relating to both voluntary and mandatory renewable and energy efficiency schemes.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Gas reflects the sourcing and management of AGL Energy's gas supply and transportation portfolio. Trading and Origination - Gas is also responsible for the management of the price exposures related to AGL Energy's oil-linked wholesale gas contracts.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Other reflects the Trading and Origination resourcing and support, in addition to the Decentralised Energy business, responsible for the management of the Residential Battery Program and Business Customer Demand Response products, along with other growth initiatives in AGL Energy's orchestration pathway.\n\nThe other components of Integrated Energy comprises AGL Energy's power generation portfolio and other key sites and operating facilities across the Coal, Gas Generation, Renewables, Natural Gas, and Other business units.\n\n- \u00b7 Coal Operations primarily comprises AGL Macquarie (Bayswater and Liddell power stations) and AGL Loy Yang.\n- \u00b7 Gas Generation primarily comprises AGL Torrens, Barker Inlet Power Station, Kwinana Swift Power Station and Somerton Power Station.\n- \u00b7 Renewables primarily comprises hydroelectric power stations, the operation of solar power as well as wind power generation. Operational costs to maintain the wind farms are reported within Trading and Origination - Electricity to align with the gross margin of the related power purchase agreements.\n- \u00b7 Natural Gas includes the Newcastle Gas Storage Facility (currently 'held for sale' as at 30 June 2021), the Silver Springs underground gas storage and production facility, the natural gas compression and LPG separation facility, the natural gas production assets at Camden in New South Wales and the North Queensland gas assets, including the Moranbah Gas Project.\n- \u00b7 Other primarily consists of the Major Projects business focused on the development and construction of greenfield growth opportunities, and technical and business support functions.\n\nRefer to the map in Section 1.1 for asset locations and details.",

Excluding Insurance premiums internally transferred from Centrally Managed Expenses of $24 million, Underlying EBIT was down $386 million or 25.2%. The decline in Underlying EBIT by $410 million was largely due to lower gross margin from Trading and Origination - Electricity (down $239 million) and Trading and Origination - Gas (down $180 million). Higher operating costs of $25 million were more than offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortisation of $36 million, largely as a result of the impact of impairments recognised at 31 December 2020 (as per Section 4.1.2).\n\n|                                                           | FY21 $m   | Restated FY20 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Gross margin                                              | 2,420     | 2,841              |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (790)     | (765)              |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                         | 1,630     | 2,076              |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                             | (511)     | (547)              |\n| Underlying EBIT                                           | 1,119     | 1,529              |\n\nGross margin was down largely due to lower electricity and LGC prices, the impact of unplanned outages on availability at AGL Macquarie, and compressed gas margins driven by the impact of legacy supply contracts maturing and increases in haulage and storage costs. This was partly offset by increased generation at AGL Loy Yang as a result of the Unit 2 extended outage in the prior year and related $125 million of insurance proceeds recognised in the period, of which $120 million was recognised in gross margin and $5 million in operating costs.\n\nOperating Costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) were $790 million, an increase of $25 million compared with the prior year due to expenditure on fully impaired assets that would have otherwise been treated as capital. Operating Costs (excluding the impact of impairment and depreciation and amortisation) were $773 million, an increase of $8 million compared with the prior year, due to higher labour costs driven by Enterprise Agreement wage escalations, increased costs to maintain plant availability at AGL Macquarie, commencement of the first full year of operations at Barker Inlet Power Station, turbine repairs at Kwinana Swift Power Station to ensure future availability and a transfer of insurance premiums from Centrally Managed Expenses.

Wholesale and Large Business customer volumes were 5.2 PJ higher however this was offset by lower contracted rates for new and existing customers, driven by lower oil prices and market prices. Consumer customer volumes were 2.3 PJ lower as per commentary in 3.1.2. Compressed gas margins were driven by the impact of legacy lower cost supply contracts maturing and increases to haulage and storage costs, partly offset by the benefit of lower oil prices on contracted supply.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Other Underlying EBITDA was $(45) million, down 2.3% mainly due to expansion of the Decentralised Energy business to develop future growth opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Coal Underlying EBITDA was $(436) million, down 6.9%, driven by the half-year impairment impact on operating costs across AGL Energy's generation fleet ($17 million impact), higher forced outage costs at AGL Macquarie, maintenance activities at AGL Loy Yang to ensure mine coal supply reliability and station availability, increased labour costs due to Enterprise Agreement wage escalations and the transfer of insurance premiums from Centrally Managed Expenses. This was partly offset by AGL Loy Yang Unit 2 insurance proceeds for material damages of $22 million.\n- \u00b7 Gas Generation Underlying EBITDA was $(59) million, down 3.5%, due to commencement of the first full year of operations at Barker Inlet Power Station and turbine repairs at Kwinana Swift Power Station to ensure future availability. This was partly offset by the closure of two A station units at Torrens and decreased labour costs as a result of lower overtime due to the closure, operational efficiencies and a milder summer.\n- \u00b7 Renewables Underlying EBITDA was $(24) million, up 53.8% due to a reclassification of all AGL Energy operated wind farm costs to Trading and Origination gross margin to align with the gross margin of the related PPAs. This was partly offset by the commercial settlement of a historic legal dispute.\n- \u00b7 Natural Gas Underlying EBITDA was down $(8) million due to lower gas sales at Camden and Moranbah, and increased costs of well workover activities in the Surat Basin (AGL Energy's joint operation in Queensland involved with oil and gas exploration and production), primarily driven by regulatory requirements. This was partly offset by lower costs of well workover activities at Moranbah.\n- \u00b7 Other Underlying EBITDA was $(54) million, down 42.1% reflecting the transfer of insurance premiums from Centrally Managed Expenses to Integrated Energy in the period, partly offset by a reallocation of Communications and Change Leadership headcount to Centrally Managed Expenses and lower consultancy spend.\n\n## 5.2.2 Operating costs\n\nIntegrated Energy operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) of $(790) million increased by 3.3% compared with the prior year. Excluding the transfer of insurance premium costs from Centrally Managed Expenses of $24 million, operating costs were flat on prior year.\n\n|                                                           | FY21 $m   | FY20 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Labour                                                    | (370)     | (382)     |\n| Contracts and materials                                   | (277)     | (262)     |\n| Other                                                     | (143)     | (121)     |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (790)     | (765)     |\n\n- \u00b7 Labour costs were $(370) million, down 3.1%, driven by savings related to labour initiatives, a reallocation of Communications and Change Leadership headcount to Centrally Managed Expenses, and increased utilisation of AGL Energy labour on rehabilitation and capital projects across the fleet. This was partly offset by Enterprise Agreement wage escalations primarily at AGL Energy's coal operations.\n- \u00b7 Contracts and materials costs were $(277) million, up 5.7%, including $17 million of expenditure at Liddell that would have otherwise been treated as capital following the asset being fully impaired at 31 December 2020, higher costs associated with increased forced outages at AGL Macquarie, commencement of the first full year of operations at Barker Inlet Power Station and turbine repairs at Kwinana Swift Power Station to ensure future availability. This was partly offset by the reclassification of wind farm operational expenditure to Trading and Origination gross margin.\n- \u00b7 Other operating costs were $(143) million, up 18.2% due to a transfer of insurance premiums from Centrally Managed Expenses to Integrated Energy in the year ($24 million) and a subsequent increase in premiums. This was partly offset by the reclassification of wind farm operational expenditure to Trading and Origination gross margin.",

These costs are not reallocated to AGL Energy's operating segments because their management is the responsibility of various corporate functions.\n\nCentrally Managed Expenses' Underlying EBIT was $(372) million, an improvement of $43 million or 10.4% compared with the prior year. Excluding the impact of specific insurance policy premiums internally transferred to Integrated Energy of $24 million, Underlying EBIT improved $19 million or 4.6% on prior year. Cost out initiatives decreased labour and recruitment costs following restructuring, and reduced activity due to COVID-19 resulted in lower discretionary spend on travel, consultancy, and property. Centrally Managed Expenses also benefited from lower investment in digital transformation initiatives relative to the prior year ($8 million). These gains were partly offset by an increase in the insurance premiums not related to the policies transfer to Integrated Energy and a reallocation of Communications and Change Leadership headcount from Integrated Energy. Depreciation and amortisation increased due to AGL Energy's capitalisation of costs relating to an exit of applications out of data centres and migration into cloud.\n\nRestated\n\n|                                                                        | FY21 $m   | FY20 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross margin                                                           | -         | -         |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation)              | (310)     | (359)     |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                                      | (310)     | (359)     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                          | (62)      | (56)      |\n| Underlying EBIT                                                        | (372)     | (415)     |\n| Breakdown of operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) |           |           |\n| Labour                                                                 | (152)     | (158)     |\n| Hardware and software costs                                            | (106)     | (109)     |\n| Consultants and contractor services                                    | (18)      | (31)      |\n| Insurance premiums                                                     | (7)       | (29)      |\n| Other                                                                  | (27)      | (32)      |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation)              | (310)     | (359)     |\n\n|",

AGL Energy's investment in Ovo creates a vehicle to explore innovative products and propositions including emerging segments.

Changes to Segmental Reporting\n\nOn 30 June 2021 AGL Energy confirmed its intent to execute a demerger of its retail business and form two listed energy businesses, Accel Energy and AGL Australia. Subsequent to year end, the internal reporting structure of AGL Energy has been updated, effective 1 July 2021, to align to the two new businesses. The new reporting structure will lead to new segments to be disclosed in the financial reports of AGL Energy for the half year ended 31 December 2021 and later reports. Refer to Note 39 in the Financial Report for further detail on the composition of the new segments and the basis of realignment of reported results. A reconciliation of Underlying EBIT between the previous and revised segmental reporting structure and commentary on AGL Energy's FY21 financial performance reported under the new segmental reporting structure is provided below.\n\n## Reconciliation of Underlying EBIT\n\n|                                    | FY21 $m   | Restated FY20 $m   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Revised Structure:                 |           |                    |\n| Trading and Origination            | 1,787     | 2,018              |\n| Operations                         | (969)     | (989)              |\n| Accel Energy                       | 818       | 1,029              |\n| Customer                           | 202       | 171                |\n| Supply and Trading                 | 302       | 503                |\n| Investments                        | 9         | 18                 |\n| AGL Australia                      | 513       | 692                |\n| Other (Centrally Managed Expenses) | (372)     | (415)              |\n| Underlying EBIT                    | 959       | 1,306              |\n| Previous Structure:                |           |                    |\n| Customer Markets                   | 203       | 174                |\n| Integrated Energy                  | 1,119     | 1,529              |\n| Investments                        | 9         | 18                 |\n| Centrally Managed Expenses         | (372)     | (415)              |\n| Underlying EBIT                    | 959       | 1,306              |\n\n## Accel Energy\n\nAccel Energy Underlying EBIT was $818 million, down 20.5% largely due to lower gross margin from Trading and Origination and higher operating costs in Operations. This was partly offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortisation.\n\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination Underlying EBIT was $1,787 million, down 11.4% due to lower electricity prices and lower LGC prices, lower generation at AGL Macquarie due to lower availability because of unplanned outages, including during periods of high prices in New South Wales and Queensland. This was partly offset by increased generation at AGL Loy Yang with Unit 2 returned to service, $103 million of proceeds related to insurance claims for the AGL Loy Yang Unit 2 outage and lower unit fuel costs for AGL Macquarie driven by lower coal prices and a higher proportion of deliveries from lower cost legacy contracts.\n- \u00b7 Operations Underlying EBIT was $(969) million, up 2.0% due to a reduction in depreciation and amortisation, largely as a result of the impact of impairments recognised at 31 December 2020 (as per Section 4.1.2) across the thermal generation fleet and gas operations, and AGL Loy Yang Unit 2 insurance proceeds received for material damages of $22 million. Partly offsetting this was an increase in operating costs due to expenditure on fully impaired assets that would have otherwise been treated as capital, higher labour costs driven by Enterprise Agreement wage escalations, increased costs to maintain plant availability at AGL Macquarie, and a transfer of insurance premiums from Centrally Managed Expenses.\n\n|",

Lower digital uplift outlays in the year combined with the investment in digital transformation in prior years, together with a continued focus on efficiencies, helped absorb the increased operating costs associated with the full year impact of Southern Phone Company, growth and launch of AGL Telecommunications and the successful acquisitions of Click Energy, Solgen and Epho, and increased net bad debt expense due to COVID-19. The increase in gross margin was driven by an increase in Consumer Gas gross margin due to higher revenue rates, and the margin associated with the acquisition of Click Energy, which was fully integrated into Customer Markets on 1 April 2021. This was partially offset by a decrease in Consumer Electricity gross margin due to customers switching to lower-priced products.\n- \u00b7 Supply and Trading Underlying EBIT was $302 million, down 40.0% largely due to Supply and Trading Gas portfolio, which was down $180 million or 42.8% due to compressed gas margins driven by the impact of legacy supply contracts maturing and increases in haulage and storage costs, lower Wholesale and Large Business customer contracted rates and lower Consumer customer volumes. The Supply and Trading electricity portfolio was also down, driven by lower LGC and electricity prices, partly offset by the increase in generation from Barker Inlet Power Station, Silverton and Coopers Gap wind farms.\n- \u00b7 Investments Underlying EBIT was $9 million, down 50.0%. Refer to Section 5.4 for detailed commentary.\n\n## Other (Centrally Managed Expenses)\n\nThese costs are managed and reported under Centrally Managed Expenses.

Portfolio Review Summary\n\nThe portfolio review for the Electricity (Section 8.2) and Gas (Section 8.3) businesses outlines the margin achieved for each of AGL Energy's portfolios across operating segments, and demonstrates how value is generated within each business. The portfolio reviews in Section 8.2 and 8.3 start with volume information before summarising external customer revenue, customer network and other costs, fuel and gas costs net of hedging, and costs of managing and maintaining owned and contracted generation assets, to arrive at a portfolio's margin. A per unit rate ($/MWh for electricity and $/GJ for gas) is derived from each category of revenue and cost using the relevant associated volumes.\n\nThe tables in Sections 8.2 and 8.3 should be read in conjunction with Section 8.4 to reconcile the segmental revenue and costs allocated to each portfolio with Group Underlying EBIT.\n\n## 8.1 Portfolio Review Summary to Underlying Profit after Tax\n\nRestated\n\n|                                                                     | FY21 $m   | FY20 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Electricity Portfolio                                               |           |           |\n| Total revenue                                                       | 6,934     | 7,172     |\n| Customer network, green compliance, and other cost of sales         | (3,461)   | (3,312)   |\n| Fuel costs                                                          | (857)     | (1,013)   |\n| Generation running costs                                            | (635)     | (716)     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                       | (465)     | (499)     |\n| Net portfolio management                                            | 58        | 164       |\n| Electricity Portfolio Margin (a)                                    | 1,574     | 1,796     |\n| Gas Portfolio                                                       |           |           |\n| Total revenue                                                       | 2,389     | 2,496     |\n| Customer network and other cost of sales                            | (555)     | (584)     |\n| Gas purchases                                                       | (967)     | (950)     |\n| Haulage, storage and other                                          | (347)     | (308)     |\n| Gas Portfolio Margin                                                | 520       | 654       |\n| Natural Gas                                                         | (36)      | (29)      |\n| Gas Portfolio Margin (including Natural Gas) (b)                    | 484       | 625       |\n| Other AGL Energy                                                    |           |           |\n| Other margin 1                                                      | 33        | 44        |\n| Customer Markets operating costs                                    | (517)     | (527)     |\n| Integrated Energy other operating costs                             | (90)      | (82)      |\n| Investments operating costs                                         | (2)       | -         |\n| Centrally Managed Expenses operating costs                          | (310)     | (359)     |\n| Other depreciation and amortisation                                 | (213)     | (191)     |\n| Net finance costs                                                   | (224)     | (179)     |\n| Income tax expense                                                  | (199)     | (319)     |\n| Total Other AGL Energy (c)                                          | (1,522)   | (1,613)   |\n| Underlying Profit after Tax (a + b + c)                             | 536       | 808       |\n| Non-controlling interests 2                                         | 1         | -         |\n| Underlying Profit after tax attributable to AGL Energy shareholders | 537       | 808       |\n\n## 8.2 Electricity portfolio\n\nThe Electricity portfolio review combines Integrated Energy's Trading and Origination (Electricity), Operations (Coal, Gas Generation and Renewables), with Customer Markets (Consumer and Large Business) businesses to outline the portfolio's performance across operating segments.\n\nAll electricity volume generated by AGL Energy is sold into either the National Electricity Market (NEM) or Western Australian Wholesale Electricity Market (collectively 'the pool') for which  AGL Energy receives pool generation revenue.

This was partly offset by a full year of depreciation of the Barker Inlet Power Station and ownership of the Kwinana Swift Power Station, and higher depreciation associated with an increase in environmental rehabilitation assets in December 2020.\n\n| Net Portfolio Management     |         |         |        |        |        |        |\n|------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Pool generation revenue 1    | 2,386   | 3,294   | 58.0   | 75.2   | 41,137 | 43,828 |\n| Pool purchase costs 1        | (2,582) | (3,156) | (62.2) | (75.7) | 41,507 | 41,687 |\n| Net derivative revenue       | 254     | 26      | 6.2    | 0.6    | 41,137 | 43,828 |\n| Net Portfolio Management (d) | 58      | 164     | 1.4    | 4.1    | 40,567 | 40,349 |\n\n|",

Governance Summary\n\nAGL Energy is committed to ensuring that its corporate governance framework, policies and practices are of a high standard. Delivering on this commitment requires AGL Energy to have a sound understanding of current governance requirements and practices, as well as being attuned to emerging governance trends and shifting stakeholder expectations. Set out below is a summary of selected aspects of AGL Energy's corporate governance framework and a highlight of the key governance issues affecting AGL Energy during FY21.\n\nThroughout FY21, AGL Energy's corporate governance arrangements were consistent with the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th edition) published by the ASX Corporate Governance Council (ASX Principles). AGL's 2021 Corporate Governance Statement is available\n\n## at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance .\n\nAGL Energy's 2021 Corporate Governance Statement outlines AGL Energy's arrangements in relation to its Board, Board Committees, Executive Team, risk management framework and financial reporting, diversity and inclusion, key corporate governance policies and shareholder engagement.\n\nAGL Energy's governance framework is summarised in the diagram below.\n\n## 9.1 Board skills\n\nDuring FY21, AGL Energy's Board Skills Matrix (Table 1) was updated to reflect the changes in the composition of the Board, further analysis of the skills and experience of each Director and an assessment of the current and future strategic direction, opportunities and challenges facing AGL Energy.\n\nThe skills analysis demonstrated that AGL Energy's Board members are highly experienced and all skills that would be considered important or critical to the effective performance of the Board are present on the Board. In particular, the Board has strength in the skills and experience required for the delivery of AGL's new strategic priority of creating two leading ASX listed energy companies through a demerger of AGL Energy:\n\n- \u00b7 AGL Australia Limited - Australia's largest energy-led multiproduct retailer of essential energy services to households and businesses. AGL Australia will also own and operate Australia's largest private hydro fleet as well as fast-start gas-fired power stations and a growing battery development portfolio, with capabilities across wholesale and decentralised electricity and gas trading, storage and supply.\n- \u00b7 Accel Energy Limited - Australia's largest baseload electricity supplier via the Loy Yang A, Macquarie Generation and Torrens Island sites, which will prioritise the responsible operation of these sites and facilitate their accelerated transition to low-carbon industrial energy hubs. Accel Energy will also be Australia's largest operator and offtaker of wind energy via the Macarthur, Hallett, Wattle Point and Oaklands Hill wind farms, with the potential to develop 1,600 MW of new wind projects.\n\nGiven the transition of Graeme Hunt from Chairman to Interim Managing Director and CEO in April 2021 and the retirement of John Stanhope at AGL's AGM in September, the Board is currently undertaking a process to consider additional appointments to the Board of AGL in FY22, including the appointment of a Director with expertise in climate change risk, ESG governance and industry transition. The proposed demerger of AGL Energy will require the consideration of the composition of the Boards of each company to ensure that each Board (and each Board committee) has the skills and experience to fulfil their responsibilities on implementation of the demerger. The Board is utilising the Board Skills Matrix to identify Directors with skills and experience in climate change risk and ESG, energy markets, environmental issues, digital retail, technology, customer markets and other relevant skills and experience that will be required for the demerged entities.\n\nFurther details about AGL Energy's Board Skills Matrix are set out in AGL Energy's 2021 Corporate Governance Statement available at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance .\n\n## 9.2 Key areas of focus during FY21\n\nThe key areas of focus for the Board during FY21, in addition to standing agenda items, are set out in Table 2.\n\nThe key areas of focus for the Board Committees, in addition to standing agenda items, are set out in Table 3.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 10. Remuneration Report\n\nThis Remuneration Report forms part of the Directors' Report.\n\n## Message from the Chair of the People & Performance Committee\n\nDear shareholders,\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for AGL Energy Limited (AGL Energy) and its consolidated entities for the year ended 30 June 2021 (FY21).\n\n## A challenging year for AGL Energy\n\nFY21 was a challenging year for AGL Energy. The results reflect a sharp decline in wholesale prices for electricity, lower gross margins in wholesale gas, higher costs to support our operational customer response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased depreciation expense following recent investment, and the impact of impairments made during the year. To balance this, we have met our objective to keep FY21 operating expenditure flat, excluding COVID-19 impacts and acquisitions. A net profit after tax of $537m is down 34% from FY20 and highlights the difficult market conditions facing AGL Energy.\n\nAcross our key customer metrics we have continued the progress made during FY20 on our Net Promoter Score (NPS) with AGL Energy ending FY21 ranked #1 against tier 1 competitors and a 20.7% improvement in the FY21 Event NPS. Similar improvements have been achieved in our key safety metrics of total injury frequency rate (TIFR) and the high potential near miss ratio, although the incident at our Liddell site, causing a serious injury to one of our employees, means that there is an ongoing need to sharpen the focus on safety. After two years of improvement, employee engagement decreased from 73% in FY20 to 62% which reflects the level of change and uncertainty being experienced by AGL Energy employees as they navigate the current operating environment, the proposed demerger and the ongoing pandemic conditions.\n\nThe executive team have delivered some notable achievements this year against their individual objectives, particularly to progress our strategic objectives. The acquisitions of Click Energy, Epho and Solgen have built on strong customer growth and enhanced our solar capabilities, our investment in renewable energy has continued via our 20 percent interest in PowAR, which has recently completed the acquisition of Tilt Renewables, whilst the announcement of 850 MW of grid-scale battery projects forms part of a cleaner energy future.\n\n## Linking performance to FY21 remuneration outcomes\n\nWhile AGL Energy's financial performance did not meet the threshold required to warrant payment on that component under the shortterm incentive (STI), performance against non-financial metrics, including safety, customer and individual objectives would have delivered an STI award to executives in FY21, albeit at low levels.\n\nHowever, in undertaking a holistic review of the balanced scorecard and the company's performance, the Board has exercised its discretion to adjust STI outcomes to zero for executives. This is not a decision taken lightly, considering the challenging operating environment and the need to retain critical executives through a period of uncertainty but reflects AGL Energy's underlying principle of aligning reward with overall performance and shareholder outcomes.\n\nThe outcomes of both the relative total shareholder return (TSR) and return on equity (ROE) metrics under the FY19 long-term incentive (LTI) offer reflect the financial performance of AGL Energy over the three-year performance period, with 0% of performance rights vesting for participants. This result reflects the challenging environment and highlights the difficulty of setting appropriate longterm targets.\n\nTo summarise, in light of AGL Energy's performance:\n\n- \u00b7 No executive key management personnel (KMP) received a fixed increase during the year;\n- \u00b7 Zero STI outcomes have been determined for FY21, at the discretion of the Board, for all executive KMP including the former MD & CEO;\n- \u00b7 There was 0% vesting under the FY19 LTI offer which was tested on 30 June 2021, with both the relative TSR, and ROE outcomes being below threshold. Impairments and share buy-backs were excluded from this calculation;\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Director fees were not increased during the year; and\n- \u00b7 The 0.5% increase in superannuation guarantee contributions effective 1 July 2021 was absorbed by those AGL Energy employees paid on a fixed remuneration basis.\n\n## Responding to feedback from shareholders\n\nIn light of the vote against the FY20 remuneration report at last year's AGM, we have spent time engaging with and listening to our shareholders' concerns on the remuneration framework and disclosures. The Board has taken this feedback very seriously and our response is set out in detail in Section 10.1.1 of this report. In summary, the following changes have been implemented for FY21. These changes have been designed to better align our remuneration structure with company performance, drive long term shareholder value and provided enhanced transparency:\n\n- \u00b7 STI disclosures now include specific targets and target ranges to allow for a more accurate assessment of performance over the financial year to be undertaken;\n- \u00b7 There is clearer alignment between STI outcomes and FY21 performance outcomes. Applying the scorecard approach would have delivered STI awards significantly below target, reflecting the overall company performance. However, the Board has exercised discretion this year to adjust the STI outcome to zero for executives, a reflection of the FY21 financial performance and shareholder experience;\n- \u00b7 In the context of lower wholesale electricity prices and lower gross margins in gas, establishing an appropriate target range for a ROE performance metric continues to be challenging. The ROE metric has been removed from the FY22 LTI plan, with 75% of the outcome to be determined against relative TSR performance and 25% against carbon transition performance metrics; and\n- \u00b7 Carbon transition metrics will remain in the LTI plan for FY22 to ensure that the leadership team continues to focus on the responsible transition away from carbon-generated energy, in line with both the Transformation and Social Licence strategic objectives.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nFor 'good leaver' executives who participated in the FY20 bridging grant, the Board will keep its commitment to lapse an LTI award in full to ensure that two pro-rated grants are retained, not three (as is the case for Brett Redman).\n\nWe continue to engage with shareholders and look forward to receiving further feedback on our FY21 remuneration report as we work to improve our remuneration framework and disclosures.\n\n## A new chapter in AGL Energy's history\n\nAn accelerated desire for action on climate change, shifts in government policy and rapidly falling technology costs have changed our market and led AGL Energy to announce a proposed demerger. The proposed demerger positions AGL Energy to continue to lead Australia's energy transition as two strong businesses with compelling growth and investment opportunities for each. A summary of the remuneration approaches for the two entities will be provided in the scheme booklet, scheduled for release in 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the former MD & CEO, Brett Redman, resigned from the role and advised the Board that he believed he could not make a long-term commitment beyond the proposed post-demerger. As a result, the Board agreed it was appropriate to put in place alternative leadership arrangements to lead the business into its next chapter.\n\nMr Redman's resignation as Director became effective immediately and the Board determined that he will be treated as a 'good leaver' as he remains available to AGL Energy to assist with a smooth transition until the expiry of his notice period on 21 October 2021. Mr Redman will receive benefits in accordance with the terms of his service agreement and AGL Energy's incentive plans. As such, a pro-rata portion of LTI performance rights remain on foot to be tested against the relevant metrics at the end of their respective performance periods. However, as noted above, Mr Redman did not receive an STI in FY21.\n\nGraeme Hunt, previously the AGL Energy Chair, stepped into the MD & CEO role on an interim basis in April 2021. This provided important continuity of leadership for the business and certainty for our people and shareholders as we work through considerations of the demerger and establish a platform for future success. At the time, Mr Hunt's fixed remuneration was established at the same level as Mr Redman's and the Board determined that he would not participate in either short-term or long-term incentive plans, given the interim nature of the role. To provide immediate shareholder alignment, and in lieu of any incentives, restricted shares valued at $600,000 were allocated to Mr Hunt upon commencement, with restrictions lifting in July 2022.\n\nAs Mr Hunt has been appointed to the MD & CEO role on a permanent basis taking effect from 1 July 2021, the intial offer of restricted shares to the value of $600,000 made will be reduced on a pro-rated basis for the interim period to $165,354. From 1 July 2021 Mr Hunt's fixed remuneration is $1,550,000 and he will participate in AGL's incentive plans for FY22.\n\nWe welcome your feedback on the remuneration practices and disclosures for AGL Energy and look forward to your support at our 2021 AGM.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiane Smith-Gander AO Chair, People & Performance Committee",

Arrangements are in place to ensure any advice is independent of management.\n- \u00b7 During FY21, the Committee engaged EY to act as independent remuneration advisers. EY did not provide any remuneration recommendations as defined in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to the People & Performance Committee during FY21.\n\n## Further details\n\n- \u00b7 The complete People & Performance Charter is reviewed at least every two years and is available on AGL Energy's website: agl.com.au/BoardAndCommitteeCharters .\n\n## 10.2.2 Management of Risk & Remuneration\n\nThe AGL Energy remuneration framework is designed to ensure that executives focus on delivering against the strategic priorities, ensuring that company and shareholder outcomes are primary considerations in the decision-making processes. The framework is structured to mitigate against any excessive risk-taking or short-term decisions by executives through the establishment of scorecard metrics that align with strategic priorities, the use of deferred equity in both the short and long-term incentive plans, and the clawback provisions within those equity plans.\n\n## 10.2.3 Board Discretion\n\nThe Board, in conjunction with the People & Performance Committee, exercises discretion to ensure the quantum of executive remuneration is appropriate in light of individual and company performance, for example by adjusting STI and LTI vesting outcomes. This discretion ensures that the quantum of executive remuneration is appropriate. Discretion guidelines have been implemented to formalise current practice. The guidelines provide a framework to assist the Board with identifying one-off/extraordinary circumstances (e.g. impairments) and whether those circumstances require an adjustment to incentive outcomes. The guidelines support consistency in application over time and does not limit the Board's overarching discretion under AGL Energy's incentive plans.\n\n## 10.2.4 KMP share ownership\n\nTo provide for shareholder alignment, AGL Energy operates a minimum shareholding policy for KMP and other executives reporting to the Managing Director & CEO, subject to compliance with AGL Energy's Securities Dealing Policy. Shareholdings are reported in Table 10.7.2.\n\nThe minimum shareholding policies stipulate the following requirements:\n\n|",

Further details are provided in the LTI section (10.4.4) of this report.\n\n## New remuneration arrangements for the MD & CEO\n\nGraeme Hunt, previously the AGL Energy Chair, stepped into the MD & CEO role on an interim basis in April 2021 to provide continuity of leadership. Mr Hunt's fixed remuneration was established at the same level as that of the former MD & CEO, and the Board determined that he would not participate in either short-term or long-term incentive plans, given the interim nature of the role.\n\nTo provide immediate shareholder alignment, and in lieu of any incentives, restricted shares valued at $600,000 were allocated to Mr Hunt upon commencement, with the intention that Mr Hunt would remain in the role until the implementation of the proposed demerger, with share restrictions lifting in July 2022. However, upon his appointment to the MD & CEO role permanently, the Board has determined that it is appropriate for Mr Hunt to participate in the incentive plans for FY22 to ensure his reward outcomes are determined by, and align with company performance.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that Mr Hunt is not receiving both the restricted shares and be eligible for an incentive in the same period, a pro-rating factor has been applied to the value of restricted shares to cover the interim period from 22 April to 30 June 2021. The $600,000 of restricted shares has subsequently been adjusted to $165,354, with the restrictions on the shares remaining until 1 July 2022.\n\nThe new remuneration arrangements for Mr Hunt in the MD & CEO role have been established with regard to appropriate benchmarks based on the projected market capitalisation of Accel Energy.\n\nMr Hunt's remuneration, from 1 July 2021, will be as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed remuneration of $1,550,000;\n- \u00b7 STI eligibility, with a maximum opportunity of 67% of fixed remuneration for FY22; and\n- \u00b7 LTI eligibility, with a maximum opportunity of 167% of fixed remuneration for FY22.\n\n|",

The FY21 remuneration mix at maximum for executives is summarised below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe variable/at-risk component of total remuneration is 70% and 64% at maximum for the former Managing Director & CEO and other executives respectively. The Interim Managing Director & CEO did not participate in any incentive plans in FY21, in accordance with the terms of employment.\n\n## 10.4 FY21 performance and executive remuneration outcomes\n\n10.4.1 Fixed remuneration approach and FY21 outcomes\n\n## What is the purpose of fixed remuneration?\n\n- \u00b7 The purpose of establishing fixed remuneration is to attract and retain the right person for the job to lead AGL Energy in tackling the challenges confronting the energy industry.\n- \u00b7 Fixed remuneration at AGL Energy therefore needs to be competitive to ensure the company is able to attract and retain those executives with experience in companies or industries undergoing similar transformation.\n\n## How is fixed remuneration established at AGL Energy?\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed remuneration is determined by considering market benchmarks in peer companies.\n- \u00b7 AGL Energy's approach is to set an executive's fixed remuneration initially at a level reflecting their skill and experience that allows progressive increases to apply as the executive performs and becomes more experienced in their role.\n- \u00b7 Fixed remuneration is reviewed annually in the context of market positioning and performance. This may or may not result in an increase for executives.\n\n## What were the changes to fixed remuneration in FY21?\n\n- \u00b7 No changes were made to continuing executives' fixed remuneration levels during FY21.\n- \u00b7 The Board concurred with management's recommendation that the economic impact on AGL Energy's customers and the community arising from the COVID-19 pandemic made any remuneration increases inappropriate.\n\n## Are there any other considerations in setting fixed remuneration?\n\n- \u00b7 AGL Energy is committed to gender pay equity across employees, including executives. There are no gender pay gaps in fixed remuneration for current executives in roles of equivalent size.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 10.4.2 STI approach and FY21 outcomes\n\n## What is the purpose of the STI?\n\n- \u00b7 The objective of the STI is to reward executives for delivering financial returns and progressing AGL Energy's strategy.\n\n## What are the performance measures?\n\nExecutives have STI scorecards which sets performance expectations for key performance measures:\n\n- \u00b7 financial (50-60%);\n- \u00b7 strategic (30%); and\n- \u00b7 individual (10-20%) measures.\n\nThe scorecard for FY21 is provided in Section 10.4.2.1. For FY21:\n\n- \u00b7 Net profit after tax is the key financial measure to drive shareholder returns and operate as efficiently as possible in the market within which AGL Energy operates;\n- \u00b7 The strategic measures are focused on safety, customer and employee engagement and are aligned with the Business Value Drivers; and\n- \u00b7 Individual strategic objectives focus on Growth, Transformation and Social Licence to drive the overall AGL Energy strategy. This is aligned with the delivery of value creation for shareholders.\n\n## How are performance targets established?\n\n- \u00b7 Annual performance targets are determined with reference to a number of inputs: the previous year's performance outcomes, external market conditions, and longer-term business forecasts. Performance targets are set at levels which are considered to be a \"stretch\" in the context of these inputs, stretched beyond the 'business as usual' performance standards.\n- \u00b7 The STI target range for net profit after tax is established early in the financial year based on AGL Energy's budget and the perceived degree of difficulty in that budget based on internal forecasts and prevailing market conditions at that time.\n- \u00b7 AGL Energy's budget may not reflect the market guidance range. Guidance is initially released at the time of AGL Energy's results in August and may change during the year. Guidance normally has a broader range than incentive targets.\n\n## What is the award opportunity?\n\n## Interim MD & CEO\n\n## Former MD & CEO :\n\n## Other executives:\n\nDid not participate in the STI plan in FY21\n\nTarget = 60%\n\nMaximum = 100%\n\nTarget = 70% Maximum = 84%\n\n## How does the Board assess performance?\n\n- \u00b7 In assessing outcomes under the STI, the Board assess the quality of the results and the manner in which they were achieved as well as ensuring that those outcomes are aligned with the experience of AGL Energy's shareholders.\n- \u00b7 The starting point for considering STI outcomes is Statutory Profit. The Board may adjust Statutory Profit in consideration of any non-cash fair value movements in financial instruments and non-recurring significant items that materially affect AGL Energy's financial results to derive Underlying Profit after tax. This is to ensure that management are not unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by items outside their control.\n- \u00b7 The Board expects an executive delivering against all performance objectives to achieve STI opportunities at their target levels given that performance targets are set at \"stretch\" levels.\n- \u00b7 The Board applies discretion in the treatment of any significant items and their impact on outcomes against performance targets and subsequent STI awards.\n\n## How are STI awards delivered?\n\n- \u00b7 Awards are delivered as a mix of cash and Restricted Shares (no performance conditions apply, restrictions lifted after two years):\n\n## Former MD & CEO:\n\n## Other executives:\n\n50% cash\n\n50% Restricted Shares\n\n- \u00b7 Restricted Shares are entitled to receive dividends and carry voting rights.\n\n## What happens upon cessation of employment?\n\n- \u00b7 When an executive leaves the organisation prior to the payment date for awards by way of resignation or dismissal for cause, the executive would not be eligible to receive any STI award for the relevant year.\n- \u00b7 Where the Board determines that an executive is a \"good leaver\" they may be entitled to a pro-rated award for the year. The grant and treatment of Restricted Shares is subject to Board discretion.\n\n|\n\n75% cash\n\n25% Restricted Shares",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## Are clawback conditions applicable?\n\n- \u00b7 The Board has discretion to prescribe clawback events for any unvested equity awards which may be clawed back from executives.\n\n## What happens upon a change of control?\n\n- \u00b7 The Board will determine at the time a change of control event occurs how to treat unvested equity in accordance with the plan rules, and ultimately has absolute discretion in determining this treatment, taking into consideration market practice.\n\n## Is there a Hedging Policy?\n\n- \u00b7 AGL Energy has a policy in place that prevents executives from entering into any derivative or other financial product in relation to their equity plan(s) participation.\n\nThe group STI scorecard outcomes are detailed in Table 10.4.2.1, and the individual strategic objective outcomes are shown in the subsequent tables.\n\n## Group performance objectives and FY21 outcomes\n\n- \u00b7 Safety: Total injury frequency rate was 2.3, down from 3.3 for FY20, a strong indicator that the ongoing focus on safety is helping to keep employees and contractors safe. The high potential near miss ratio was 1.1:1, an improvement from 0.9:1 for FY20. However, the transformer incident at Liddell in December 2020, which resulted in a serious injury to an employee, shows there is still more to be done. In consideration of this incident, the above target outcome for safety was adjusted to below target.\n- \u00b7 Customer: the AGL Energy Net Promoter Score (NPS) has continued the progress made in FY20 with AGL Energy again ranked #1 against tier 1 competitors, with a +4.9 outcome, up from +2.3 in FY20. Event NPS has also improved, at 19.2 compared with 15.9 in FY20, an increase of 20.7%.\n- \u00b7 Employee Engagement: an engagement score of 62%, down from 73% in FY20, is reflective of the uncertainty employees have experienced through the announcement of the structural separation and the subsequent demerger proposal.\n- \u00b7 Financial: Underlying Profit after tax was $537 million, down 34% from FY20, below the target range and in the lower levels of the revised guidance range of $500 - 580m. This reflects a decline in wholesale prices for electricity, lower gross margins in wholesale gas, the impact of unplanned outages on availability at AGL Macquarie, higher depreciation expense and the continuing impact of COVID-19 on demand and customer margin.\n\nThe FY21 STI scorecard results in STI outcomes of between 20.25 - 31.46% of maximum for executives, including the former MD & CEO. However, in consideration of overall performance, particularly the financial performance, and the shareholder experience, the Board has exercised discretion to adjust STI outcomes to zero for executives.",

Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) = 33.4% weighting. A comparative, external market performance benchmark against companies in the S&P/ASX100 Index. Provides a direct link between executive reward and shareholder return.\n- 2. Return on Equity (ROE) = 33.3% weighting. Provides a measure of the effectiveness with which AGL Energy is deploying shareholders' funds by dividing profit after tax for a given period by the monthly average of shareholders' equity for the same period.\n- 3. Carbon Transition metrics = 33.3% weighting. Provides the focus for executives to deliver against carbon transition objectives. Comprises three sub-metrics to ensure a balanced assessment.\n\nThe vesting schedules are provided under FY21offers - terms.\n\n## What is the performance period?\n\n- \u00b7 The performance metrics are measured either over a four-year period or at the end of the four-year period (1 July 2020 30 June 2024).\n- \u00b7 All performance measures are to be tested once at the end of the performance period to determine the vesting percentage.\n\n## What is the award opportunity?\n\n- \u00b7 The opportunities for LTI awards, as a % of fixed remuneration, are as follows:\n\n## Interim MD and CEO :\n\n## Former MD & CEO:\n\n## Other executives:\n\nDid not participate in the LTI plan in FY21\n\nThreshold = 65%\n\nMaximum = 130%\n\nThreshold = 40-50%\n\nMaximum = 80-100%\n\n- \u00b7 The number of Rights granted is based on a 30-day volume weighted average share price (VWAP) up to the commencement of the performance period.\n\n## How does the Board assess performance?\n\n- 1. Relative TSR: Independent assessment of TSR by external advisors is undertaken, based on 30-day average VWAPs, and provides the outcome for the Board to consider the final evaluation of performance;\n- 2. ROE: internal calculations are undertaken based upon the audited statutory profit after tax for the relevant financial year. The Board determines the final outcome.\n- 3. Carbon transition: internal calculations are undertaken and are subject to limited assurance by external auditors on an annual basis. Revenue from green electricity and carbon neutral products and services is derived from the reported revenue. The Board determines the final outcome.\n\n## How are the LTI awards delivered?\n\n- \u00b7 Awards are delivered in Performance Rights. Participants are not entitled to receive dividends.\n\n## What happens upon cessation of employment?\n\n- \u00b7 Unvested rights lapse if a participant ceases employment with AGL Energy before the end of the performance period.\n- \u00b7 Where the Board determines that an executive is a \"good leaver\" they may be entitled to retain a pro-rated number of Performance Rights which remain subject to the plan rules until performance testing at the end of the performance period.\n\n## Are clawback conditions applicable?\n\n- \u00b7 The Board has discretion to prescribe clawback events for any unvested equity awards which may be clawed back from executives.\n\n|",

The former MD & CEO, Brett Redman will retain only two pro-rated grants instead of three upon cessation of employment. Similarly, three other senior leaders ceased employment with \"good leaver\" status during FY21 and the Board determined that an LTI grant lapsed in full upon cessation of employment. Therefore, there is no opportunity for participants to benefit from a perceived 'double vesting' event as only two pro-rated grants will be retained upon cessation, not three.",

The ROE metric has therefore been removed.\n- \u00b7 The weighting of the relative TSR performance metric is being increased from 33.4% in FY21 to 75% for the FY22 LTI offer. The weighting of the carbon transition metrics is being decreased from 33.3% to 25%. This provides enhanced alignment between executive rewards and shareholder outcomes over the performance period.\n- \u00b7 Other than the performance metrics and weightings no further changes have been implemented. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.\n\n## What are the performance measures?\n\nTwo performance measures apply to the FY22 LTI offer:\n\n- 1. Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) = 75% weighting. A comparative, external market performance benchmark against companies in the S&P/ASX100 Index. Provides a direct link between executive reward and shareholder return.\n- 2. Carbon Transition metrics = 25% weighting. Provides the focus for executives to deliver against carbon transition objectives. Comprises three sub-metrics to ensure a balanced assessment.\n\nThe vesting schedules are provided in tables below.\n\n## What is the performance period?\n\n- \u00b7 The performance metrics are measured either over a four-year period or at the end of the four-year period (1 July 2021 - 30 June 2025).\n- \u00b7 All performance measures are to be tested once at the end of the performance period to determine the vesting percentage.\n\n## Relative TSR vesting schedule\n\n| AGL Energy's relative TSR ranking against comparator group   | Vesting of award subject to relative TSR measure (% of maximum)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 50th percentile                                    | 0%                                                                |\n| 50th percentile to 75th percentile                           | Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100%                        |\n| At or above 75th percentile                                  | 100%                                                              |\n\n## Carbon transition vesting schedules\n\n| Controlled intensity in FY25   | Vesting of award                           | % Controlled renewable & storage capacity at 30 June 2025   | Vesting of award                           | Green & carbon neutral products & services in FY25   | Vesting of award                           |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| More than 0.885                | 0%                                         | Less than 29.4%                                             | 0%                                         | Less than 16.5%                                      | 0%                                         |\n| 0.885 to 0.823                 | Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100% | 29.4% to 36.9%                                              | Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100% | 16.5% to 22.1%                                       | Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100% |\n| Less than 0.823                | 100%                                       | More than 36.9%                                             | 100%                                       | More than 22.1%                                      | 100%                                       |\n\n|",

Under Australian Accounting Standards, the fair value is determined as at the offer date and is apportioned on a straight-line basis across the expected vesting period after adjusting at each reporting date for an estimation of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.\n- 8. Includes a proportion of the fair value of all Restricted Shares held at the start of the year, or which were granted during the year, generally for retention or sign-on purposes.\n- 9.

The fee pool is regularly reviewed by the Board and, if appropriate, adjusted (subject to shareholder approval), having regard to the anticipated time commitment, workload and responsibilities attached and the fees paid by comparable organisations. The current fee pool was approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.\n\n## 10.6.2 Fee policy\n\nNon-Executive Directors receive a base fee. Members of a Committee receive a Committee fee to recognise the associated higher workload and extra responsibilities, and chairing a Committee attracts a higher fee. The Chairman of the Board receives a higher base fee in recognition of the added responsibility and time commitment; but does not receive any extra fees for participating in or chairing any Committees. Fees are inclusive of superannuation. There are no additional fees in relation to the Nominations Committee.\n\nIn setting Non-Executive Directors' fees, the Board considers the following:\n\n- \u00b7 time commitment\n- \u00b7 workload\n- \u00b7 risk and responsibility, and\n- \u00b7 market benchmark data, sourced from companies with a similar market capitalisation.\n\nTo ensure independence, Non-Executive Directors do not receive performance-related remuneration. This allows the Board to focus on governance and both short and long-term strategy.\n\n## 10.6.3 FY21 fees\n\nFees for Non-Executive Directors remained unchanged during the financial year.\n\n## Table 10.6.3.1: Non-Executive Director fees\n\nTable 10.6.3.2: Non-Executive Director remuneration for FY21\n\n| Board/Committee                                             | Chair fee $   | Member fee $   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Board base fee                                              | 603,000       | 201,000        |\n| Audit & Risk Management Committee                           | 55,200        | 27,600         |\n| People & Performance Committee                              | 44,900        | 21,200         |\n| Safety, Sustainability & Corporate Responsibility Committee | 44,900        | 21,200         |\n\n| Non-Executive Director   | Year                        | Cash fees $   | Superannuation $   | Total $   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|\n| Current                  |                             |               |                    |           |\n| M Bloom                  | FY21 (from 1 July 2020)     | 223,775       | 20,603             | 244,378   |\n| P Botten                 | FY21                        | 291,607       | 21,261             | 312,868   |\n|                          | FY20                        | 220,148       | 20,852             | 241,000   |\n| J Hey                    | FY21                        | 251,806       | 21,694             | 273,500   |\n|                          | FY20                        | 249,797       | 21,003             | 270,800   |\n| P McKenzie               | FY21                        | 228,128       | 21,672             | 249,800   |\n|                          | FY20                        | 226,347       | 21,003             | 247,350   |\n| D Smith-Gander           | FY21                        | 261,676       | 5,424              | 267,100   |\n|                          | FY20                        | 253,949       | 10,501             | 264,450   |\n| J Stanhope               | FY21                        | 255,706       | 21,694             | 277,400   |\n|                          | FY20                        | 253,647       | 21,003             | 274,650   |\n| Former                   |                             |               |                    |           |\n| G Hunt                   | FY21 (until 21 April 2021)  | 469,180       | 17,476             | 486,656   |\n|                          | FY20                        | 575,997       | 21,003             | 597,000   |\n| L Hosking                | FY21 (until 7 October 2020) | 61,353        | 5,829              | 67,182    |\n|                          | FY20                        | 226,347       | 21,003             | 247,350   |\n| TOTAL                    | FY21                        | 2,043,231     | 135,653            | 2,178,884 |\n|                          | FY20                        | 2,006,232     | 136,368            | 2,142,600 |",

        "page_content": "## Other Required Disclosures\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nThese Other Required Disclosures (pages 87 to 88) are attached to and form part of the Directors' Report.\n\n## 11. Other Required Disclosures\n\n## 11.1 Changes in state of affairs\n\nIn the opinion of the Directors there were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the AGL Energy consolidated entity that occurred during the financial year other than those included in this Directors' Report.\n\n## 11.2 Proceedings on behalf of the company\n\nNo person has applied under Section 237 of the Corporations Act for leave of the Court to bring proceedings on behalf of AGL Energy or intervene in any proceedings to which AGL Energy is a party for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of AGL Energy for all or any part of those proceedings. AGL Energy was not a party to any such proceedings during the year.\n\n## 11.3 Commercial in confidence information\n\nFurther information about likely developments in the operations of AGL Energy and its consolidated entity and the expected results of those operations in the future has been included in this Directors' Report except to the extent disclosure of the information would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the consolidated entity.\n\nThe type of information not disclosed includes commercial in confidence information such as detailed operational plans and strategies that would provide third parties with a commercial advantage.\n\n## 11.4 Non-audit services\n\nNon-audit services have been provided during the year by the external auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Australia ( Deloitte ). Disclosure of the details of these services can be found in Note 26 of the Financial Report 2021.\n\nThe Board has a formal policy on the provision of auditing and related services. Specifically, the external auditor is precluded from providing any services that might threaten its independence or conflict with its assurance and compliance role. Semi-annual reports on the provision of auditing and related services are provided to the Board through the Audit & Risk Management Committee. The Directors are satisfied that the provision of other accounting advice and services by the external auditor is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors.\n\nThe policy and procedures in place, and the review by the Audit & Risk Management Committee, enable the Directors to conclude that non-audit services provided did not compromise the external auditor's independence requirements of the Corporations Act.\n\nThere is also in place an agreed rotation policy for the senior auditor of Deloitte. Mr Jason Thorne (Partner, Deloitte) has acted as AGL Energy 's lead audit partner since 2017. Under the Corporations Act, Mr Thorne can only play a \"significant role in the audit\" of AGL Energy for 5 successive financial years, unless the Board resolves to extend Mr Thorne's role as lead audit partner for a period of one (or two) years in accordance with the Corporations Act. The Audit & Risk Management Committee recommended to the Board that it resolve to extend Mr Thorne's role as lead audit partner for one year. The basis for the recommendation being that as the demerger of\n\nAGL Energy into two leading energy businesses would increase the complexity of the accounting and financial control environment over the year ending 30 June 2022, to maintain the quality of the audit over this period, Mr Thorne's term as lead audit partner should be extended. The Board resolved to extend Mr Thorne's role as lead audit partner for one year.\n\nThe external auditor annually provides a letter to the Company Secretary on its independence within the meaning of relevant legislation and professional standards. No officers of AGL Energy were partners or directors of Deloitte during this or prior periods.\n\n## 11.5 Rounding\n\nAGL Energy is an entity to which ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191 applies and, in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the Financial Report and this Directors' Report have been rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 11.6 Auditor's Independence Declaration\n\nA copy of the external auditor's declaration under Section 307C of the Corporations Act in relation to the audit for the financial year is attached to the AGL Energy Financial Report 2021.\n\n## 11.7 Indemnification and insurance of officers\n\nAGL Energy 's constitution indemnifies, to the extent permitted by law, officers of the consolidated entity when acting in their capacity in respect of:\n\n- \u00b7 liability to third parties (other than related entities) when acting in good faith; and\n- \u00b7 costs and expenses of successfully defending legal proceedings and ancillary matters.\n\nThe Directors named earlier in this Report and the Company Secretaries, have the benefit of the indemnity, together with any other person concerned in or who takes part in the management of the consolidated entity.\n\nDuring the year, AGL Energy paid premiums in respect of contracts insuring all Directors of AGL Energy as listed earlier, all Directors of related bodies corporate of AGL Energy, secretaries and other Officers of the consolidated entity against liabilities incurred in their capacity as Director or Officer, as the case may be, of the consolidated entity.\n\nThe contract prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liabilities covered and the amount of premium.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Other Required Disclosures\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 11.8 Subsequent events\n\nOn 30 June 2021 AGL confirmed its intent to execute a demerger of its retail business and form two listed energy businesses, Accel Energy and AGL Australia. Subsequent to year end, effective 1 July 2021, and as described in Note 39 of the Financial Report, the internal reporting structure of AGL has been updated, to align to the two new businesses.\n\nOn 3 August 2021 AGL completed a $357.6 million capital contribution into Powering Australian Renewables (PowAR) to fund its 20% interest in PowAR's acquisition of Tilt Renewables Limited's Australian business.\n\nApart from the matters identified in the financial statements or notes thereto, there has not been any matter or circumstance that has arisen since 30 June 2021 that has significantly affected or may significantly affect the operations of AGL Energy, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of AGL Energy in the future.\n\n## 11.9 Non-IFRS Financial Information\n\nThe Operating & Financial Review attached to and forming part of this Directors' Report includes a number of non-International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial measures. AGL Energy management uses these non-IFRS financial measures to assess the performance of the business and make decisions on the allocation of resources.\n\nPrincipal among these non-IFRS financial measures is Underlying Profit. This measure is Statutory Profit/(Loss) adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 significant items (which are material items of revenue or expense that are unrelated to the underlying performance of the business); and\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of profit or loss (to remove the volatility caused by mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the underlying asset differently).\n\nAGL Energy believes that Underlying Profit provides a better understanding of its financial performance than Statutory Profit/ (Loss) and allows for a more relevant comparison of financial performance between financial periods.\n\nUnderlying Profit is presented with reference to ASIC Regulatory Guide 230 'Disclosing non-IFRS financial information', issued in December 2011. AGL Energy's policy for reporting Underlying Profit is consistent with this guidance. The Directors have had the consistency of the application of the policy reviewed by the external auditor of AGL Energy.\n\n## 11.10 Corporate governance\n\nA copy of AGL Energy's Corporate Governance Statement can be found on the AGL website at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance .\n\n## 11.11 Environmental regulation\n\nAGL Energy's businesses are subject to a range of environmental laws and regulations as well as project and site-specific environmental permits and approvals issued at both the federal and state government levels.\n\nAn event occurred on 16 July 2020 at Liddell Power Station where an internal spillway wall in the Liddell Ash Dam was breached, resulting in ash laden water being discharged via a licensed discharge point, which flows into Lake Liddell. AGL Macquarie Pty Limited ( AGLM ) notified the NSW Environment Protection Authority ( NSW EPA ) of the event and carried out repairs to the internal spillway wall. On 19 August 2020, the NSW EPA issued an official caution to AGLM for an alleged pollution of waters offence.\n\nOn 4 September 2019, an event occurred at Bayswater Power Station, where a hole was formed in a fly ash transfer pipeline, resulting in the release of fly ash slurry into a depression within a dry bed of Bayswater Creek. AGLM notified the NSW EPA of the event and carried out clean up and rehabilitation actions in consultation with the NSW EPA. On 2 September 2020, AGLM entered into an enforceable undertaking with the NSW EPA in relation to this event. The enforceable undertaking includes commitments by AGLM to undertake testing and rectification works associated with the pipeline, contribute funds to local environment projects as approved by the NSW EPA up to a total amount of $500,000, conduct industry training on the testing program and pay the NSW EPA's costs. Three of the six undertakings have been completed as at the date of this report. The remaining undertakings are due to be completed by 31 January 2022. AGLM is on track to meet its commitments within the required timeframe.\n\nOn 30 October 2020, AGLM notified the NSW EPA that emission testing undertaken at Liddell Power Station recorded exceedance of the prescribed solid particles concentration limit provided under AGLM's environment protection licence. On 26 March 2021, the NSW EPA issued a penalty infringement notice and an official caution to AGLM for two alleged failures to comply with a licence condition which requires AGLM to not exceed solid particles concentration limits.\n\nOn 5 April 2021, an event occurred at Bayswater Power Station, where a leak occurred in a fly ash transfer pipeline, resulting in the release of a small amount of fly ash slurry into Bayswater Creek. AGLM notified the NSW EPA of the event. AGLM carried out clean up actions and repaired the relevant section of the pipeline. On 24 June 2021, the NSW EPA issued a penalty infringement notice for an alleged pollution of waters offence.\n\n## Approval of Directors' Report\n\nThis Directors' Report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors and is signed for and on behalf of the Board this 12th day of August 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Botten\n\nChairman",

Segment information\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nAGL reports segment information on the same basis as the internal management reporting structure. The operating segments reflect the manner in which products are sold, whether retail or wholesale, and the nature of the services provided.\n\nAGL views the business as three interrelated segments collectively servicing our customers' needs.\n\n- \u00b7 Customer Markets comprises the Consumer and Large Business customer portfolios responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas, broadband/mobile/voice, solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers. Customer Markets sources its energy from Integrated Energy at a transfer price based on methodologies that reflect the prevailing wholesale market conditions and other energy costs in each state. Customer Markets also includes sales, marketing, brand, and AGL's customer contact and call centre operations.\n- \u00b7 Integrated Energy comprises of Trading and Origination - Electricity and Trading and Origination - Gas and is responsible for managing the price risk associated with procuring electricity and gas for AGL's customers and for managing AGL's obligations in relation to renewable energy schemes. Trading and Origination controls the dispatch of AGL's owned and contracted generation assets, third party gas agreements and associated portfolio of energy hedging products. The other components of Integrated Energy comprise AGL's power generation portfolio and other key sites and operating facilities across the Coal, Gas, Renewables, Natural Gas, and Other business units.\n- \u00b7 Investments comprises AGL's interests in the ActewAGL Retail Partnership, Powering Australian Renewables (PowAR), Energy Impact Partners' Fund, Energy Impact Partners' Fund (Europe), Activate Capital Partners, Solar Analytics Pty Limited, Sunverge Energy Inc, Raygen Resources Pty Limited, Honey Insurance Pty Limited and Ecobee Inc.\n\nIn the segment financial results, the 'Other' category consists of various Corporate activities. These are not considered to be reportable segments.\n\n## Segment financial results\n\nThe measurement of segment results is in line with the basis of information presented to the Board of Directors for internal management reporting purposes. The performance of each segment is measured based on their Underlying earnings before interest and tax (Underlying EBIT) contribution to AGL. Certain items of income and expense are excluded from the segment results to show a measure of underlying performance. These items include changes in fair value of financial instruments and significant items.\n\nAGL operates as an integrated business and uses a portfolio approach to manage the operations and assets to drive value and efficiency. AASB 8 Operating Segments requires AGL to report segment information on the same basis as the internal management structure. As a result, the Customer Markets segment reports the revenue and margin associated with satisfying the gas and electricity requirements of AGL's consumer and business customer portfolio, whilst the Integrated Energy segment reports the revenue, expenses and margin related to AGL's operating sites and AGL's wholesale energy portfolio.\n\nFor the purposes of reviewing the carrying values of AGL assets, the segments impute a revenue transfer between Customer Markets, and Integrated Energy. Revenues are derived to approximate prices similar to transactions with third parties.\n\n|",

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which AGL expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nThe majority of contractual energy supply arrangements with customers have no fixed duration, generally require no minimum consumption by the customer and are able to be terminated by either party at any time without incurring significant penalty. Given this, the enforceable contracts are considered short term (less than 12 months) in nature. There are some longer term contracts particularly those with business and wholesale customers.\n\nAGL has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nAGL's primary performance obligations are the supply of energy (electricity or gas) over the contractual term. There are either individual contracts representing separate purchasing decisions of customers, or the units of supply of energy represent a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and hence is considered one performance obligation satisfied over time. For the shorter term contracts, the performance obligations are considered to be satisfied, and revenue is recognised, as and when the units of energy are delivered. Additionally, in relation to AGL's longer term contracts, AGL determines that the right-toinvoice approach to measure the progress towards completion\n\nof the performance obligation is most appropriate as it depicts AGL's performance. AGL uses the units of energy delivered to the customer as estimated as part of the unbilled process (and later verified by meter readings) or as indicated by the customer's energy meter (where these are known more frequently).\n\nIn most instances, the transaction price is determined by the unbilled process. For some wholesale contracts, AGL also considers the effects of variable consideration and for some business sales, there is non-cash consideration and consideration payable to the customer relating to renewable energy certificates (RECs).\n\n## Electricity and Gas revenue Residential electricity and gas sales\n\nResidential energy sales relate to the sale of energy (electricity and gas) to retail customers. Residential sales are classified as individual, short term, day-by-day contracts and are recognised as revenue on a day-by-day basis upon delivery of energy to customers.\n\nWhere the customers are eligible to receive additional discounts (e.g. pay on time discounts to encourage timely payment of energy invoices), AGL considers this to be variable consideration, which is estimated as part of the unbilled process.\n\n## Portfolio approach for residential electricity and gas sales\n\nAGL recognises revenue from contracts with its residential customers at the electricity and gas portfolio levels. Furthermore, AGL has elected to apply the portfolio approach in accounting for the fair valuing of RECs, accounting for connection fees and sales commissions. Recognition at the portfolio level would not differ materially from applying the standard on a contract-bycontract basis.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 2. Revenue (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Business electricity and gas sales\n\nBusiness sales represent the sale of energy to business customers. Revenue recognition is largely consistent with residential sales. These contracts are longer term in nature and represent a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and are treated as one performance obligation satisfied over time based on the output delivered to the customer. For a large majority of business sales customers, revenue is recognised when AGL has the 'right to invoice' the customer for consideration that has been determined to correspond directly with the value of units of energy delivered to that customer.\n\nSome business sales arrangements also include the transfer of RECs to the customer, which can, in some instances, represent a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Material right applicable to residential and business sales\n\nWhere a fixed fee (e.g. connection fee, distribution fee, capacity reservation charge, etc.) received from a customer does not represent a transfer of a good or service to a customer, but the customer is charged an upfront amount, the customer contract contains a material right in that the customer is effectively able to buy additional units of energy at a lower cost per unit.\n\nThe material right is valued based on its relative standalone selling price. If standalone selling prices are not directly observable, the price is estimated by taking into consideration the discount the customer would receive in a standalone transaction and the likelihood that the customer would exercise the option.\n\nRevenue from a material right is recognised as and when the right is exercised by the customer or the right expires, whichever is earlier.\n\n## Wholesale energy sales\n\nWholesale energy sales represent the sale of electricity and gas to wholesale customers. These involve a high volume of energy usually over an extended period of time. Supply of energy represents a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and is the major performance obligation. It is treated as one performance obligation which is satisfied over time. In some instances, there is an additional performance obligation in these contracts by way of a material right.\n\nRevenue is recognised for these arrangements when AGL has the 'right to invoice' the customer for consideration that has been determined to correspond directly with the value of units of energy delivered to that customer.\n\nSome wholesale electricity arrangements may involve the transfer of RECs to the customer, which may represent a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Renewable energy certificates (RECs) applicable to business and wholesale sales\n\nThere are two main instances where RECs pass between AGL and its customers. These include those transferred under a selfsurrender arrangement as part of the consideration for energy and those that are sold to customers.\n\n## Received from customer (self-surrender)\n\nAs a retailer, AGL incurs costs in relation to its renewable energy obligations for which RECs must be surrendered to the government. For most customers, the costs associated with meeting these renewable energy obligations is factored into the cost of energy (i.e. there is a REC cost component built into the price paid). For some customers, instead of paying for the cost of the energy in cash, they have the option to elect to pay for their energy usage in the form of cash and by self-surrendering RECs.\n\nThe obligation to remit RECs to the regulator remains with AGL, but the customer is choosing to meet part of its payment by way of surrendering its own RECs rather than paying for the cost of the RECs as part of the overall cost of the energy.\n\nThe transfer of RECs as consideration in exchange for energy is a form of non-cash consideration. AGL measures non-cash consideration at its fair value at the date of surrender (i.e. the date of transfer by the customer).\n\n## Transferred to the customer\n\nFor some customer contracts, AGL sells both energy and RECs to the customer. A customer may purchase RECs to meet its own REC obligations and/or where it wants actual title to the RECs.\n\nThe RECs sold to a customer represent a separate performance obligation, i.e. a good, as the customer can benefit from the RECs on their own and the promise to transfer RECs to the customer is separately identifiable from the other promises in the contract (e.g. promise to deliver energy).\n\nAGL determines the portion of the transaction price that it allocates to the RECs using the relative standalone selling price method.\n\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the proportion of the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation to the sum of the stand-alone selling prices of all of the performance obligations in the contract.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 2. Revenue (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nRevenue is recognised as and when the control of the RECs are transferred to the customer, which occurs at a point in time. Where the customer is entitled to all the RECs generated at a specified power plant (e.g. in cases where power plants are located at the customer's site), transfer of control to the customer occurs as and when the RECs are generated. In other cases where the RECs are transferred to the customer from inventory, control of the RECs transfers upon receipt by the customer.\n\n## Pool Revenue\n\n## Pool generation sales\n\nPool generation sales and pool purchase costs relate to sales by AGL's generation assets to the grid and purchases of energy by AGL wholesale on behalf of AGL's retail business. AGL has assessed it is acting as the principal in relation to such sales and purchases of energy to the pool and therefore the transactions are recognised on a 'gross' basis. Revenue from these arrangements is recognised at the spot price achieved when control of the energy passes to the grid.\n\n## Variable consideration\n\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, AGL estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\n\n## Significant financing component\n\nAGL applies the practical expedient in that it does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n\n## Costs to obtain a contract\n\nCosts that are incurred regardless of whether a contract is obtained are expensed as incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer. Discretionary bonuses\n\npaid to sales staff based on meeting annual sales targets, overall profitability and individual performance evaluations are expensed as incurred as they are not directly attributable to identifiable contracts and do not meet the criteria for capitalisation. The direct costs of establishing customer contracts are recognised as an asset when they relate to a specific customer acquisition campaign. The direct costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. Direct costs include customer acquisition fees paid to channel partners and upfront account purchase payments.\n\n## Costs to fulfil\n\nThe costs incurred by AGL to fulfil a contract with a customer, which may qualify for capitalisation include connection fees paid/incurred by AGL (including those charged by distribution businesses to provide such network services, or those incurred directly by AGL in connecting a customer). These costs do not fall within the scope of any other standard (i.e. the cost is not part of inventory, an intangible asset or property, plant and equipment). Therefore, these costs are capitalised as a contract cost (cost to fulfil) asset and amortised over the life of the customer contract or customer relationship, where material.\n\n## Cost sharing arrangements\n\nAGL enters into cost sharing arrangements whereby the costs to operate and maintain assets that are shared with parties outside the AGL Group are recharged to the parties in accordance with their beneficial interest. These recharged amounts are recognised as revenue when the associated costs to which they relate impact the statement of profit or loss. Revenue is measured with reference to the fair value of the consideration received.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that AGL will comply with the conditions of the grant and the grant will be received.\n\nGovernment grants that require AGL to construct an asset are recognised as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the related assets.",

Revenue (cont.)\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Variable consideration and constraints\n\nAGL includes variable consideration in the transaction price as estimated at the inception of a contract. However, if it is considered 'highly probable' that a significant reversal of revenue recognised will occur in the future, the variable consideration is constrained and not included in the transaction price.\n\nAGL's contractual arrangements contain a number of variable pricing elements including pay-on-time discounts, payment plans, and escalations. Some of these variable elements are resolved during the reporting period. Where they are not, management estimates the likelihood of the variable pricing\n\nelement eventuating and recognises the variable pricing element to the extent it is not highly probable that it will reverse.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nAGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity services once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the customer. Management estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the financial period.

AGL's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which AGL expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if AGL has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either:\n\n- \u00b7 the same taxable entity; or\n- \u00b7 different taxable entities that intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.",

Income tax (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Current and deferred tax for the period\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity) or a business combination.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nAGL Energy Limited (the Parent Entity) and its wholly-owned Australian resident subsidiaries formed a tax-consolidated group pursuant to Australian taxation law with effect from 25 October 2006 and are therefore taxed as a single entity from that date. AGL Energy Limited is the head entity in the tax-consolidated group.\n\nOn 23 July 2012, AGL Generation Holdco Pty Ltd, a subsidiary 99.99% owned by AGL, and AGL Generation Pty Ltd elected to form a tax-consolidated group with Loy Yang Marketing Holdings Pty Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiary, in addition to the existing group. On 27 July 2012, Great Energy Alliance Corporation Pty Limited (GEAC) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Deferred tax assets relating to tax losses\n\nAGL recognises a deferred tax asset relating to tax losses incurred by a subsidiary. The recoverability of this deferred tax asset is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income, by the subsidiary, to utilise those tax losses. Management judgements and estimates are required in the assessment of this recoverability, including forecasting sufficient future taxable income.\n\n## 8.

Current tax liabilities and assets and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and tax credits of the tax-consolidated group are recognised by the head entity in each tax consolidated group.\n\nThe members of the tax-consolidated group have entered into a tax sharing and tax funding agreement. The tax funding agreement requires payments to/from the head entity equal to the current tax liability/asset assumed by the head entity and any tax loss deferred tax asset assumed by the head entity. The payments are recorded as intercompany receivables/payables.",

Trade and other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less an allowance for expected credit loss. AGL's policy requires customers to pay in accordance within agreed payment terms. Depending on the customer segment, trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days.\n\nAGL assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets and lease receivables, AGL applies the simplified approach, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\n## Unbilled revenue\n\nUnbilled revenue represents estimated gas and electricity services supplied to customers but unbilled at the end of the reporting period. Unbilled gas and electricity revenue is not collectible until such time as customers' meters are read and bills rendered.\n\n|",

Trade and other receivables (cont.)\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Expected credit loss on trade receivables and unbilled revenue\n\nAGL uses an allowance matrix to measure expected credit losses of trade receivables and unbilled revenue from its customers. Trade receivable amounts are disaggregated into customer segments.\n\nLoss rates are estimated in each age category and are based on the probability of a receivable progressing through to write-off. Factors to estimate the loss rate are based on risk assessment performed for each customer segment and economic factors such as wholesale electricity forward curves, commodity fuel forward curves and prevailing macro-economic information.\n\nThe methodology for calculating the allowance for expected credit loss has not changed as a result of COVID-19, however certain assumptions have been updated and further segmentation of the customer base has been introduced to reflect observed payment behaviours. The key assumptions impacted are external macro-economic trends such as unemployment and small business impacts.\n\n## Unbilled revenue\n\nAGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity sales once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the customer. Management estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the financial period. Various assumptions and financial models are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption.\n\nSome of the assumptions and estimates include:\n\n- \u00b7 Volume and timing of energy consumed by the customers\n- \u00b7 Various pricing plans prevalent and allocation of the estimated volume to such pricing plans\n- \u00b7 Loss factors\n- \u00b7 Behavioural discounts.\n\n## 10.

Costs of inventories are determined on a first-in-first-out or weighted average basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less the estimated costs necessary to sell the inventory.",

In the period ended 30 June 2021, AGL began to actively market NGSF for sale with a disposal expected to be complete within the year ending 30 June 2022. NGSF has been classified as held for sale as at 30 June 2021 and will no longer be depreciated, and all costs incurred will be treated as operating expenditure. An impairment loss has been recognised on the carrying value of the NGSF and is presented as an impairment loss on property, plant and equipment.

Associates are those entities in which AGL has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies of the entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which AGL has joint control and AGL has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nUnder the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise AGL's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates and joint ventures.\n\nAn impairment loss is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss and is reversed if there has been a favourable change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between AGL and an associate or a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of AGL's interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of an impairment.\n\n|",

Property, plant and equipment (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the asset. Finance costs related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised. Cost may also include transfers from other comprehensive income of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nSubsequent costs are capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to AGL and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Other costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nThe gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the relevant lease or estimated useful life, whichever is the shorter. Land is not depreciated.\n\nThe estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each annual reporting period.\n\nThe following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:\n\n- \u00b7 Leasehold improvements - lesser of lease period or up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Plant and equipment - Up to 50 years\n\n## Right-of-use assets (ROU assets)\n\nA ROU asset is recognised in relation to each lease and is initially measured at cost comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made before the commencement date (reduced by lease incentives received), plus initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.\n\nA ROU asset is subsequently measured using the cost model less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. AGL does not apply the revaluation model but instead carries all\n\nROU assets at cost. The ROU asset is depreciated over its useful life. The useful life of a ROU asset for depreciation purposes is the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. Where the ROU asset is adjusted due to changes in the lease liability, the depreciation for the ROU asset is adjusted on a prospective basis.\n\nThe following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation on ROU assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Plant and equipment - ROU assets: lesser of lease period or up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Other - ROU assets: lesser of lease period or up to 50 years\n\n## Short-term and low value leases as lessee\n\nAGL has elected to apply the practical expedients available for short-term leases (i.e. where the lease period is 12 months or less) and low-value asset leases. As a result of application of these practical expedients, the measurement requirements of accounting standards do not apply and the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, AGL reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, AGL estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n|",

The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is its fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed at least annually for impairment. Finite lived intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful life and tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.\n\nThe estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period.\n\nThe following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of amortisation for intangible assets with finite lives:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer relationships and contracts - 3 to 20 years\n- \u00b7 Software - 3 to 7 years\n- \u00b7 Licences - the lesser of licence term and asset useful life\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of the acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of AGL's CGUs or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, and tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nA CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU(s) and then to the other assets of the CGU(s) pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU(s). Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Software\n\nSoftware is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or development of the software. During the year ended 30 June 2021, AGL adopted a change in accounting policy in relation to the treatment of configuration and customisation costs of cloud computing arrangements. Details of the change and related restatement are presented in Note 38.\n\n## Licences\n\nLicences are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\n\n|",

Intangible assets (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Customer relationships and contracts\n\nCustomer relationships and contracts acquired in a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which economic benefits are expected to be received.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Impairment recognised for period ended 31 December 2020\n\nOn 4 February 2021, AGL announced an impairment of property, plant and equipment of $1,006 million and goodwill of $626 million. The impairments followed an accelerated deterioration to long-term wholesale energy market forecasts during the year, reflecting policy measures to underwrite new build of electricity generation and lower technology costs, leading to expectations of increased supply. As a result, the long-term outlook for wholesale electricity and renewable energy certificates indicated a sustained and material reduction in prices.\n\nCombined with sharp reductions in near-term wholesale energy prices as a result of challenging macro-economic conditions, and the outcomes of AGL's three-yearly review of environmental rehabilitation provisions, this reduced the recoverable amount of certain cash generating units.\n\n## AGL Generation Fleet\n\nAs a result of the material reduction in the outlook for wholesale prices in the long term, the carrying value of the AGL Generation Fleet CGU was estimated to exceed its recoverable amount at 31 December 2020. The cash flows of the CGU include certain legacy power purchase agreements that contain purchase prices above the forward price for electricity and/or renewable energy certificates. These contracts have no assets associated with them. The cash flows associated with these contracts were therefore separately assessed and recognised as an onerous contract. Refer to Note 19.\n\nThe carrying value of the AGL Generation Fleet CGU was estimated to exceed the recoverable amount at 31 December 2020 by $1,413 million. This amount has been recognised as an impairment expense in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Natural Gas Assets\n\nThe carrying value of the natural gas assets was estimated to exceed the recoverable amount at 31 December 2020 by $231 million. This amount has been recognised as an impairment expense in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe direct costs of establishing customer contracts are recognised as an asset when they relate to a specific customer acquisition campaign. The direct costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. Direct costs include customer acquisition fees paid to channel partners and upfront account purchase payments. All other customer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe impairment charges above are recognised within the Integrated Energy segment.\n\n## Impairment testing for year ended 30 June 2021\n\nThe recoverable amounts for the Customer Markets, Wholesale Gas and AGL Generation Fleet CGUs have been determined using value-in-use models including an appropriate terminal value. The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use include:\n\n- \u00b7 Long run electricity prices;\n- \u00b7 Corporate tax rates;\n- \u00b7 Discount rate;\n- \u00b7 Terminal growth rate;\n- \u00b7 Customer numbers and churn;\n- \u00b7 Energy procurement costs and volumes and generation volumes; and\n- \u00b7 Gross margin including assumptions around regulatory outcomes, pricing in unregulated markets and customer discounts.\n\nCorporate tax rates reflect the Australian company tax rate. The estimate of regulatory outcomes is based on actual regulatory decisions for the current price reset period, which are publicly available, together with AGL's expectations of regulatory decisions beyond the current reset period and market prices in unregulated markets. The assumed future gross margin in unregulated markets is determined with reference to historic achieved rates along with AGL's expectations of future price changes and their correlation with the long run marginal cost of electricity in the NEM (LRMC), together with the impact of expected customer discounts. Customer numbers and consumption volumes are estimated based on historical experience in various segments, together with marketing strategies for the retention and winning of customers. Energy procurement costs are estimated based on the actual hedge portfolio, together with an estimate of future hedging prices and volumes beyond the period of the actual hedge portfolio.\n\nCash flow forecasts are based on Board approved budgets and the most recent four-year plan. The terminal value is based on final year free cash flow, except for known site closures, with",

The WACC was reduced following AGL's annual cost of capital review process as a result of sustained low interest rates.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount with any impairment recognised immediately in the statement of financial performance.\n\n## Impact of possible changes in key assumptions AGL Generation Fleet\n\nFollowing a detailed impairment review of future cash flow projections, the asset values are considered recoverable at 30 June 2021.\n\nReasonably possible changes in circumstances will affect assumptions and the estimated recoverable amount of the AGL Generation Fleet CGU. These reasonably possible changes include:\n\n- \u00b7 an increase of discount rate of 50 basis points in isolation will reduce the recoverable amount by $821 million; and\n- \u00b7 a decrease in terminal growth rate of 50 basis points in isolation will reduce the recoverable amount by $736 million.\n\nThe recoverable amount is also sensitive to reasonably possible changes in long run electricity prices. When viewed in connection with the current low market prices, it is reasonably possible that a change in long run electricity price assumptions could lead to a further reduction in recoverable amount. The interrelationship of changes in this and other assumptions is very complex. Changes in the external operating environment, such as closure of aluminium smelters that consume significant volumes of electricity from the market; changes to the scheduled closure date of other power stations; or changes to government policies could result in the decrease in long run electricity prices which could give rise to a further impairment.\n\nNo other reasonably possible changes in key assumptions have been identified which may cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n## Wholesale Gas CGU\n\nFollowing a detailed impairment review of future cash flow projections, the assets are considered recoverable at 30 June 2021.\n\nThe Wholesale Gas CGU is sensitive to changes in the consumer gas margin assumptions. The recoverable amount of the CGU would equal its carrying amount if the consumer gas margin assumptions reduced by $0.19/GJ. No other reasonable possible changes in key assumptions have been identified which may cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n## Customer Markets CGU and Natural Gas Assets\n\nManagement do not believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment.\n\n## Crib Point LNG Import Terminal\n\nAn impairment charge of $47 million was recognised against Property Plant and Equipment in association with the cessation of the Crib Point LNG import terminal project.\n\n## Impact of climate change related risk\n\nThe recoverable amount estimates used in the impairment of assets analysis considers climate change risk through the adjustment of cash inflows associated with the planned closure of AGL's Liddell Power Station.\n\nManagement recognises that there is an increased pace of change in the energy industry and associated political landscape and will continue to work towards incorporating quantification of the financial impact of climate change and related policies within our annual financial filings in accordance with Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), and Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) recommendations.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, any change to the planned closure dates of AGL's coal-fired / thermal generation plants as a result of climate change may have a material impact on the National Electricity Market and may result in a material change to AGL's estimated cash inflows. Similarly, any change to policy in relation to climate change may have a material impact on the National Electricity Market and may result in a material change to AGL's estimated cash inflows.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives\n\nAGL determines whether goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are impaired at least on a semi-annual basis. This requires an assessment of impairment indications, and an estimation of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units, using a value in use discounted methodology, to which the goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are allocated.\n\n|",

Management estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining distribution costs for the financial period. Various assumptions and financial models are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption.\n\n## 18.

To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from the future principal and interest payments required on the US$395 million, the notes were converted back to approximately A$522 million through cross currency interest rate swaps. On 8 December 2016, AGL further issued A$50 million of fixed rate unsecured senior notes in the US private placement market with a 10 year maturity.\n\nOn 8 September 2010, AGL issued US$300 million of fixed rate unsecured senior notes in the US private placement market, comprising two tranches of 12 year and 15 year maturities for US$165 million and US$135 million, respectively. To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from the future principal and interest payments required on the US$300 million, the notes were converted back to approximately A$338 million through cross currency interest rate swaps.\n\n## Medium term notes\n\nOn 5 November 2014, AGL issued $600 million of senior unsecured, seven year fixed rate medium term notes. The notes were issued at a spread of swap plus 170 basis points, equating to a 5% coupon. The $600 million of medium term notes were redeemed in May 2021, 6 months before maturity (November 2021). This early redemption was funded by additional bank debt added in April 2021 through new bilateral facilities totalling $520 million.\n\n|",

Borrowings (cont.)\n\n## Bank loans\n\nIn June 2018, AGL extended its existing $410 million 6.5-year club term loan facility for another four years to mature in June 2025. As at 30 June 2021, this facility was fully utilised.\n\nIn September 2019 AGL executed a A$600 million 5-year syndicated Sustainability Linked Loan. At the end of FY21, this facility was fully utilised.\n\nDuring the FY17 financial year, AGL executed $375 million of new bank bilateral debt facilities for tenors between 1.5 to 5 years. Out of the $375 million, $100 million matured in FY19 and $200 million was further extended to mature in FY21. In December 2019, AGL extended its existing $150 million bilateral facility for 3 years with a reduced limit of $100 million, and transferred the bilateral facility on to the same sustainability-linked terms.\n\nDuring FY21, AGL prepaid its $122 million amortising Export Credit Agency facility. Further refinancing in June 2021 added an additional $430 million bank debt from new and upsized bilateral facilities to support AGL's overall liquidity requirements and the finalisation of the Tilt acquisition in FY22. As at 30 June 2021, AGL's total debt facilities were $3,857 million, of which drawn debt was $3,262 million.\n\n## CPI bonds\n\nCPI bonds rank pari passu with other unsecured debt and will mature in May 2027.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Borrowings\n\n## Interest bearing liabilities\n\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being the amount received less attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract, AGL assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains a lease, if the contract conveys to the customer a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 18. Borrowings (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nAGL assesses whether:\n\n- \u00b7 The contract involves the use of an identified asset - the asset may be explicitly or implicitly specified in the contract. Capacity portions of larger assets would be considered an identified asset if the portion is physically distinct or if the portion represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset. An asset is not considered an identified asset if the supplier has the substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use.\n- \u00b7 The customer in the contract has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use.\n- \u00b7 The customer in the contract has the right to direct the use of the asset throughout the period of use - the customer is considered to have the right to direct the use of the asset only if either:\n- -The customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use; or\n- -The relevant decisions about how and for what purposes the asset is used are predetermined and the customer has the right to operate the asset, or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use.\n\nAGL has applied the above approach in identifying leases in contracts entered into, or modified, on or after 1 July 2018. For contracts entered into before 1 July 2018, AGL has elected to apply the grandfathering practical expedient on transition. Consequently, the transition and measurement requirements only apply to arrangements that were identified as leases pursuant to the previous leases standards as at and subsequent to 1 July 2018.\n\n## AGL as lessee\n\nIn contracts where AGL is a lessee, AGL recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease for all leases other than short-term or low-value asset leases.\n\n## Lease Liabilities\n\nA lease liability is recognised in relation to each lease and is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments at the commencement date. To calculate the present value, the future lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease (IRIL), if the rate is readily determinable. If the IRIL cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate at\n\nthe commencement date is used. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date (e.g. payments that vary due to changes in CPI, or commodity prices); and\n- \u00b7 Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, purchase options and termination penalties (where relevant).\n\nVariable payments other than those included in the measurement of the lease liability above (i.e. those not based on an index or rate) are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occur.\n\nFor contracts containing lease and non-lease components, AGL accounts for each lease component separately from the non-lease components of the contract, where material. The consideration in the contract is allocated to the components based on their relative stand-alone prices.\n\nSubsequently, the lease liability is measured in a manner similar to other financial liabilities, i.e., at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. This means the liability is:\n\n- \u00b7 Increased to reflect interest on the lease liability;\n- \u00b7 Decreased to reflect lease payments made; and\n- \u00b7 Remeasured to reflect any reassessment of lease payments or lease modifications, or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.\n\nAfter commencement date, the following amounts are recognised in profit or loss with respect to the payments pursuant to the lease:\n\n- \u00b7 interest expense: recognised as finance cost; and\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments not based on an index or a rate: recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\n## Short-term and low value leases\n\nAGL has elected to apply the practical expedients available for short-term leases (i.e. where the lease term is less than 12 months) and low-value asset leases. As a result of application of these practical expedients, the measurement requirements above do not apply and the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight-line basis.\n\n|",

Borrowings (cont.)\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Leases\n\n## Lease term\n\nWhere lease arrangements contain options to extend the term or terminate the contract, AGL assesses whether it is 'reasonably certain' that the option to extend or terminate the contract will be made. Consideration is given to the prevalence of other contractual arrangements and or the economic circumstances relevant to the lease contract, that may indicate the likelihood of the option being exercised. Lease liabilities and ROU assets are measured using the reasonably certain contract term.\n\n## Lease discount rates\n\nThe discount rate applicable to a lease arrangement is determined at the inception of the contract or when certain modifications are made to the contract. The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the arrangement, or if unknown, AGL's incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is determined with reference to AGL's borrowing portfolio at the inception of the arrangement or the time of the modification and the amount and nature of the lease arrangement. If the arrangement relates to a specialised asset, incremental project financing assumptions are considered.\n\n## 19.

Provisions (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when AGL has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that AGL will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in profit or loss as part of finance costs.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nA provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.\n\n## Environmental rehabilitation\n\nThe provision for future rehabilitation costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the rehabilitation obligation at the end of the reporting period, based on current legal requirements and current technology. Future rehabilitation costs are reviewed periodically and any changes are reflected in the provision at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe initial estimate of the environmental rehabilitation provision relating to exploration, development and production facilities is\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Provision for environmental rehabilitation\n\nAGL estimates the future removal and rehabilitation costs of electricity generation assets, oil and gas production facilities, wells, pipelines and related assets at the time of installation of the assets. In most instances, removal of these assets will occur many years into the future. The calculation of this provision requires management to make assumptions regarding the removal date, application of environmental legislation, the extent of rehabilitation activities required and available technologies.\n\nThe provisions for environmental rehabilitation represents the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. In line with AGL's accounting policy, the Provisions for Environmental Rehabilitation are reviewed on a regular basis. The increase in environmental rehabilitation provisions of $1,112 million comprises $799 million from a reduction in the discount rate used to derive the present value of future estimated rehabilitation cash flows from 10 percent to 3 percent, and $313 million from an increase in estimated future expenditure following the completion of the three-yearly review of long-term rehabilitation requirements.\n\n## Provision for onerous contracts\n\nAs discussed in Note 16, recent changes to market forecasts for wholesale electricity and renewable energy certificates, now reflect a sustained and material reduction in the outlook for wholesale prices in the long term. The cash flows of the AGL Generation Fleet CGU include certain legacy power purchase agreements that contain purchase prices above the forward price for electricity and renewable energy certificates. These contracts have no assets associated with them. The cash flows associated with these contracts were therefore separately assessed and recognised as an onerous contract.\n\n|\n\ncapitalised into the cost of the related asset and depreciated/ amortised on the same basis as the related asset. Changes in the estimate of the provision for environmental rehabilitation are treated in the same manner, except that the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision is recognised as a finance cost rather than being capitalised into the cost of the related asset.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nA restructuring provision is recognised when AGL has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. Future operating losses are not provided for.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nA liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being measured reliably.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of long-term employee benefits are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by AGL in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period.",

The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.\n\nUnder these legacy power purchase agreements, AGL makes periodic payments for the electricity and green certificates generated by these assets. The agreements were primarily entered between 2006 and 2012 to support the development of the renewables sector at that time. These offtake agreements were entered at prices significantly higher than current and forecast prices for electricity and renewable energy certificates today. As a result, a provision of $1,930 million was recognised for these agreements during the year.",

Defined benefit superannuation plans\n\nAGL contributes to superannuation plans that provide defined benefit members a lump sum on retirement, death, disablement and withdrawal. Some defined benefit members are eligible for pension benefits in some cases. Lump sum benefits are calculated based on years of service and final average salary. The defined benefit plans are closed to new members.\n\nThe plans are the Equipsuper Fund (EF), Electricity Industry Superannuation Scheme (EISS), State Superannuation Scheme (SSS), State Authorities Superannuation Scheme (SASS) and the State Authorities Non-contributory Superannuation Scheme (SANCS).\n\nThe Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) legislation governs the superannuation industry and provides the framework within which superannuation plans operate. The SIS Regulations require an actuarial valuation to be performed for each defined benefit plan every three years, or every year if the plan pays defined benefit pensions.\n\nThe plans' trustees are responsible for the governance of the plans. The trustees have a legal obligation to act solely in the best interests of plan beneficiaries. The trustees have the following roles: administration of the plans and payment to the beneficiaries from plan assets when required in accordance with the plan rules; management and investment of the plan assets; and compliance with other applicable regulations.\n\nThere are a number of risks to which the plans expose AGL. The most significant risks are investment risk, salary growth risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk, legislative risk and changes in the life expectancy for members.\n\nAGL also contributes to defined contribution superannuation plans for employees, which are also provided by these plans. Contributions made to these defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Amounts recognised in profit or loss\n\n|                                                                            |   2021 $m |   2020 $m |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current service cost                                                       |        17 |        19 |\n| Net interest expense                                                       |         4 |         5 |\n| Expense recognised in profit or loss as part of employee benefits expenses |        21 |        24 |\n\n## Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n|                                                                                        | Remeasurements   | Remeasurements   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense)             | (65)             | 4                |\n| Actuarial gain/(loss) arising from changes in demographic assumptions                  | 5                | (1)              |\n| Actuarial (gain) arising from changes in financial assumptions                         | (34)             | (4)              |\n| Actuarial (gain) arising from experience                                               | (3)              | (11)             |\n| Remeasurement (gain) on defined benefit plans recognised in other comprehensive income | (97)             | (12)             |\n\n|",

Defined benefit superannuation plans (cont.)\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.\n\nDefined benefit obligation\n\n|                                                                | Increase 2021 $m   | Decrease 2021 $m   | Increase 2020 $m   | Decrease 2020 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Discount rate (0.5 percentage point movement)                  | (43)               | 47                 | (46)               | 50                 |\n| Expected salary increase rate (0.5 percentage point movement)  | 15                 | (15)               | 17                 | (16)               |\n| Expected pension increase rate (0.5 percentage point movement) | 14                 | (13)               | 11                 | (10)               |\n\nThe sensitivity analyses presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\nThere was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses from prior years.\n\n## Funding arrangements and employer contributions\n\nEmployer contributions are determined based on actuarial advice and are set to target the assets of the plans exceeding the total of members' vested benefits. Funding levels are reviewed regularly. Where assets are less than vested benefits, a management plan must be established to restore the coverage to at least 100%.\n\nAGL expects to contribute $14 million to the defined benefit plans during the year ending 30 June 2022.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2021 was EF 11 years; EISS 11 years; and SSS, SASS and SANCS 13 years.\n\n## Defined contribution superannuation plans\n\nAGL makes contributions to a number of defined contribution superannuation plans. The amount recognised as an expense for the year ended 30 June 2021 was $44 million (2020: $43 million).\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation plans\n\nFor defined benefit superannuation plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in the period in which they occur.\n\nChanges in the net defined benefit liability, including all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating AGL's obligation in respect of the plan are recognised in other comprehensive income when they occur. All other expenses relating to the defined benefit plans are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss. Any defined benefit superannuation plan asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\n## Defined contribution superannuation plans\n\nContributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation plans\n\nVarious actuarial assumptions are utilised in the determination of AGL's defined benefit obligations. AGL uses external actuarial experts to determine these assumptions.",

Share-based payment plans\n\nAGL operates the following share-based payment plans:\n\n- \u00b7 The Share Reward Plan; and\n- \u00b7 The Long-Term Incentive plan.\n\nAGL has the following other equity arrangements:\n\n- \u00b7 The share purchase plan; and\n- \u00b7 The restricted equity plan.\n\n## Share Reward Plan (SRP)\n\nThe SRP is AGL's complying broad-based employee share plan that enables eligible employees to be granted up to $1,000 of ordinary shares in AGL for no consideration each financial year. The SRP is governed by the AGL General Employee Share Plan Rules. The grant of shares is subject to the achievement of performance metrics and can therefore be scaled down in years where all objectives are not met. Shares granted pursuant to the SRP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of three years or the participant's cessation of employment.\n\nEligible participants include all AGL employees with at least 12 months service at the eligibility date (generally 1 September following the financial year end). Participants in the long-term incentive plan are excluded from any SRP grant.\n\nDetails of share movements in the SRP during the year are set out below:\n\n| Grant date                     | Balance at 1 July Number   | Granted during the year Number   | Fair Value per share $   | Released during the year Number   | Balance at 30 June Number   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2021                           |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| 28 September 2020              | -                          | 233,496                          | $14.39                   | (6,486)                           | 227,010                     |\n| 28 September 2019              | 137,475                    | -                                | -                        | (11,799)                          | 125,676                     |\n| 28 September 2018              | 128,076                    | -                                | -                        | (22,784)                          | 105,292                     |\n| 29 September 2017              | 76,836                     | -                                | -                        | (26,129)                          | 50,707                      |\n| Total Share Reward Plan shares | 342,387                    | 233,496                          |                          | (67,198)                          | 508,685                     |\n| 2020                           |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| 28 September 2019              | -                          | 145,277                          | $19.08                   | (7,802)                           | 137,475                     |\n| 28 September 2018              | 138,424                    | -                                | -                        | (10,348)                          | 128,076                     |\n| 29 September 2017              | 81,586                     | -                                | -                        | (4,750)                           | 76,836                      |\n| 30 September 2016              | 95,452                     | -                                | -                        | (95,452)                          | -                           |\n| Total Share Reward Plan shares | 315,462                    | 145,277                          |                          | (118,352)                         | 342,387                     |\n\nThe expense recognised in profit or loss, as part of employee benefits expense during the year in relation to the SRP, was $3 million (2020: $3 million).\n\n## Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan\n\nThe LTI plan provides for a grant of performance rights to eligible participants subject to AGL's performance against pre-determined metrics over a four-year performance period (prior to FY20, a three-year performance period applied). The LTI is governed by the AGL Employee Share Plan Rules. Participation is determined annually at the discretion of the Board.\n\nGenerally, performance rights are forfeited on cessation of employment. The Board has discretion with reference to the relevant facts and circumstances of the cessation to vest all or part of the balance, or to authorise a portion of the award to be retained and assessed postemployment.\n\nIn FY20, the LTI performance period was extended from three years to four years to better reflect the business planning cycle. To ensure executives a smooth transition to the extension of the performance period, a Bridging Grant was made at the same quantum as the FY20 LTI to supplement the new four-year grant by providing an opportunity for LTI vesting every year. The Bridging Grant will be tested after three years. The Bridging Grant is a one-off grant; in FY21, no further bridging arrangements were made. The Bridging Grant is not applicable for new/incoming executives.\n\n|",

Share-based payment plans (cont.)\n\n## Current LTI Plans\n\nFor the FY20 and FY19 plans, the performance rights are subject to two performance hurdles, weighted equally, based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Relative Total Shareholder Return (Relative TSR); and\n- \u00b7 Return on Equity (ROE)\n\nFor the FY21 plan, the performance rights are subject to three performance hurdles, weighted equally, based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Relative Total Shareholder Return (Relative TSR);\n- \u00b7 Return on Equity (ROE); and\n- \u00b7 Carbon Transition metrics\n\nRelative TSR is calculated by ranking AGL's TSR on a relative basis against the peer group, being S&P/ASX100 companies.\n\nROE measures the amount of Underlying Profit returned as a percentage of average monthly shareholders equity.\n\nCarbon Transition is calculated through three transition metrics. These metrics are based off emissions intensity, controlled renewable capacity and green and carbon neutral revenue.\n\nThe performance period for the outstanding LTI plans as at 30 June 2021 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 FY21: Four years from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2024\n- \u00b7 FY20: Four years from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2023\n- \u00b7 FY20: Bridging Grant: Three years from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2022\n- \u00b7 FY19: Three years from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2021\n\nThe number of shares vested are determined by the vesting schedules detailed in the tables below.\n\n## Relative TSR vesting schedule\n\n| AGL's TSR ranking against comparator group   | Percentage of performance rights which vest   | Percentage of performance rights which vest   | Percentage of performance rights which vest   | Percentage of performance rights which vest   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| LTI Plan                                     | FY21                                          | FY20                                          | FY20 Bridging Grant                           | FY19                                          |\n| Below 50th percentile                        | Nil                                           | Nil                                           | Nil                                           | Nil                                           |\n| 50th - 75th percentile                       | 50 - 100%                                     | 50 - 100%                                     | 50 - 100%                                     | 50 - 100%                                     |\n| At or above 75th percentile                  | 100%                                          | 100%                                          | 100%                                          | 100%                                          |\n\n## ROE vesting schedule\n\n| Percentage of performance rights which vest   | AGL's average ROE per LTI plan   | AGL's average ROE per LTI plan   | AGL's average ROE per LTI plan   | AGL's average ROE per LTI plan   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| LTI plan                                      | FY21                             | FY20                             | FY20 Bridging Grant              | FY19                             |\n| Nil                                           | Below 5.0%                       | Below 8.5%                       | Below 8.5%                       | Below 10%                        |\n| 50 - 90%                                      | 5.0% - 6.5%                      | 8.5% - 10.5%                     | 8.5% - 10.5%                     | 10% - 12%                        |\n| 90 - 100%                                     | 6.5% - 8.0%                      | 10.5% - 12.5%                    | 10.5% - 12.5%                    | 12% - 14%                        |\n| 100%                                          | At or above 8.0%                 | At or above 12.5%                | At or above 12.5%                | At or above 14%                  |\n\n## Carbon Transition vesting schedule\n\n| Percentage of performance rights which vest FY21   | Controlled intensity in FY24   | % Controlled renewable & storage capacity at 30 June 2024   | Green & carbon neutral products & services in FY24   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0%                                                 | above 0.895                    | below 28%                                                   | below 15.5%                                          |\n| 50 - 100%                                          | 0.895 - 0.845                  | 28% - 34%                                                   | 15.5% - 20%                                          |\n| 100%                                               | below 0.845                    | above 34%                                                   | above 20%                                            |",

Expected volatility is based on the historical share price volatility over the past three years.\n\n|                                                     | 2021        | 2020        | 2020                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|\n|                                                     | FY21 LTI    | FY20 LTI    | FY20 Bridging Grant |\n| Grant date                                          | 28 Oct 2020 | 18 Oct 2019 | 18 Oct 2019         |\n| Weighted average fair value at grant date           | $8.38       | $12.72      | $12.39              |\n| Share price at grant date                           | $12.93      | $19.13      | $19.13              |\n| Expected volatility                                 | 23.0%       | 21.0%       | 21.0%               |\n| Expected dividend yield                             | 5.3%        | 4.8%        | 4.8%                |\n| Risk free interest rate (based on government bonds) | 0.2%        | 0.8%        | 0.8%                |\n\nThe expense recognised in profit or loss as part of employee benefits expense during the year in relation to performance rights granted to executives under the LTI Plan was nil (2020: $6 million).\n\n## Shares purchased on-market\n\nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2021, 308,720 (2020: 345,413) AGL shares were purchased on-market at an average of $14.66 (2020: $19.06) per share, for a total consideration of $4,525,545 (2020: $6,584,566), to satisfy employee entitlements pursuant to the SRP and the LTI Plan.\n\n## Other equity arrangements\n\n## Share Purchase Plan (SPP)\n\nThe SPP is AGL's salary sacrifice plan that enables eligible employees to contribute up to $5,000 per financial year from their ongoing fixed remuneration and/or short-term incentive (STI) award into acquiring ordinary shares in AGL. The SPP is governed under the AGL General Employee Share Plan Rules. Shares granted pursuant to the SPP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of four years (from the start of the financial year in which they are acquired) or the participant's cessation of employment. The holding lock is in place to provide for a deferral of income tax for participants.\n\nEligible participants include all permanent AGL employees. Non-Executive Directors, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, and members of the executive team are excluded from SPP participation.\n\nDetails of share movements in the SPP during the year are set out below:\n\n| Share movements                  | Balance at 1 July Number   | Granted during the year Number   | Fair Value per share $   | Released during the year Number   | Balance at 30 June Number   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2021                             |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| Employees                        | 331,984                    | 293,063                          | $11.06                   | (71,438)                          | 553,609                     |\n| Total share purchase plan shares | 331,984                    | 293,063                          |                          | (71,438)                          | 553,609                     |\n| 2020                             |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| Employees                        | 220,272                    | 141,479                          | $19.14                   | (29,767)                          | 331,984                     |\n| Total share purchase plan shares | 220,272                    | 141,479                          |                          | (29,767)                          | 331,984                     |\n\n|",

The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the performance rights. The fair value at grant date is determined by an independent valuer.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, AGL revises its estimate of the number of performance rights expected to vest. The amount previously recognised as an expense is only adjusted when the performance rights do not vest due to non-market related conditions.\n\nPursuant to the AGL Share Reward Plan, shares are issued to eligible employees for no consideration and vest immediately on grant date. On this date, the market value of the shares issued is recognised as an employee benefits expense, with a corresponding increase in the employee equity benefits reserve.",

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\n## Estimation of fair values\n\nThe following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than six months, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other receivables/payables are discounted to determine the fair value if the effect of discounting is material.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that reflect the credit risk of various counterparties. Interest rate and cross currency swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that reflect the credit risk of various counterparties.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of borrowings is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of energy derivatives is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of lease liabilities is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted where the effect of discounting is material.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of deferred consideration is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of fair value movements in Level 3 financial instruments.\n\n|                                                    | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Opening balance                                    | 456       | 255       |\n| Total gains or losses recognised in profit or loss |           |           |\n| Settlements during the year                        | 33        | (132)     |\n| Changes in fair value                              | 229       | 277       |\n| Acquisition                                        | (7)       | -         |\n| Transfer from Level 3 to Level 2 1                 | -         | 50        |\n| Premiums                                           | 5         | (23)      |\n| Purchases                                          | 25        | 29        |\n| Closing balance                                    | 741       | 456       |\n\nThe total gains or losses for the year included a gain of $189 million relating to energy derivative Level 3 contracts held at the end of the reporting period (2020: a gain of $172 million). Fair value gains or losses on energy derivatives are included in other expenses in the line item '(Gain)/loss on fair value of financial instruments' in Note 4.\n\nThe sensitivity of Level 3 contracts with significant unobservable inputs, where the inputs are higher by 10 percent is $(166) million and lower by 10 percent is $166 million (profit after tax increase/(decrease)). Input changes were applied to forward prices with references to electricity market and emissions schemes, cost-based indexes, contract volumes and management's assumptions on long-term commodity curves.\n\n## (c) Capital risk management\n\nAGL's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity.\n\nIn order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, AGL may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. AGL's overall capital management strategy remains unchanged from 2020.\n\nThe capital structure of AGL consists of net debt (borrowings offset by cash and cash equivalents) and total equity (comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings).\n\nAGL monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio and funds from operations (FFO) to interest expense cover.\n\n|",

AGL's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of markets and seeks to manage the impact of these risks on its financial performance. AGL uses a range of derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management policy and framework. The Board has established the Audit & Risk Management Committee (the Committee), which is responsible for approving AGL's risk management policy and framework for identifying, assessing and managing risk. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing and updating the risk profile, monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management framework and reviewing at least annually the implementation of the risk management policy and framework. The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.\n\nAGL has written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, energy price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a continuous basis.\n\n## (e)  Interest rate risk management\n\nAGL is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts or other hedging instruments.\n\nAGL regularly analyses its interest rate exposure, by taking into consideration forecast debt positions, refinancing, renewals of existing positions, alternative financing, hedging positions and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, AGL had the following financial assets and liabilities exposed to floating interest rate risk:\n\n| Floating rate instruments                               | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Financial assets                                        |           |           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                               | 88        | 141       |\n| Total financial assets                                  | 88        | 141       |\n| Financial liabilities                                   |           |           |\n| USD senior notes (after effect of cross currency swaps) | 860       | 860       |\n| Bank loans                                              | 1,950     | 985       |\n| Other loans                                             | -         | 122       |\n| Interest rate swap contracts                            | (1,600)   | (1,555)   |\n| Total financial liabilities                             | 1,210     | 412       |",

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, AGL's profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows:\n\n|                                        | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease) 2020   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease) 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | 2021 $m                                       | 2020 $m                                       | 2021 $m                                               | $m                                                    |\n| Interest rates +0.5% (50 basis points) | (4)                                           | -                                             | 4                                                     | (5)                                                   |\n| Interest rates -0.5% (50 basis points) | 4                                             | -                                             | (4)                                                   | 5                                                     |\n\n## (f) Foreign currency risk management\n\nAGL undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Foreign currency risk arises primarily from overseas term borrowings and firm commitments for the purchase of plant and equipment which are denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts.\n\n## Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges\n\nAGL's Corporate Treasury policy requires the hedging of foreign currency risk using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Corporate Treasury's policy is to hedge currency exposures of anticipated cash flows in excess of $2 million and to not enter into forward foreign exchange contracts until a firm commitment is in place.\n\nAGL enters into contracts to purchase plant and equipment denominated in foreign currencies. AGL enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising from these anticipated future purchases, which are designated as cash flow hedges. During the year, no hedges were de-designated and all underlying forecast transactions remain highly probable to occur as per original forecast.\n\nThere were $139 million of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period (2020: $27 million). The fair value of those contracts is not material.\n\n|                       | Average exchange rate   | Average exchange rate   | Contract value (foreign currency)   | Contract value (foreign currency)   | Contract value (local currency)   | Contract value (local currency)   | Carrying value of outstanding hedging instruments   | Carrying value of outstanding hedging instruments   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash Flow Hedge -     |                         | 2020                    | 2021                                | 2020                                | 2021                              | 2020                              | 2021                                                | 2020                                                |\n| Outstanding contracts | 2021                    |                         | $m                                  | $m                                  | $m                                | $m                                | $m                                                  | $m                                                  |\n| Buy JPY               |                         |                         |                                     |                                     |                                   |                                   |                                                     |                                                     |\n| 0 to 6 months         | 72.41                   | -                       | 1,002                               | -                                   | 14                                | -                                 | (2)                                                 | -                                                   |\n| 6 - 12 months         | 72.08                   | 72.82                   | 300                                 | 1,903                               | 4                                 | 26                                | (1)                                                 | -                                                   |\n| 1 - 2 years           | 71.24                   | 71.53                   | 100                                 | 100                                 | 1                                 | 1                                 | -                                                   | -                                                   |\n| Buy US dollars        |                         |                         |                                     |                                     |                                   |                                   |                                                     |                                                     |\n| 0 to 6 months         | 0.76                    | -                       | 90                                  | -                                   | 117                               | -                                 | 2                                                   | -                                                   |\n| Buy Euro              |                         |                         |                                     |                                     |                                   |                                   |                                                     |                                                     |\n| 0 to 6 months         | 0.63                    | -                       | 2                                   | -                                   | 3                                 | -                                 | -                                                   | -                                                   |\n| Sell US dollars       |                         |                         |                                     |                                     |                                   |                                   |                                                     |                                                     |\n| 0 to 6 months         | -                       | 0.686                   | -                                   | 1                                   | -                                 | 2                                 | -                                                   | -                                                   |",

Such contracts enable AGL to eliminate the risk of movements in foreign exchange rates related to foreign currency denominated borrowings.\n\nThe fair value of cross currency swaps at 30 June 2021 was an asset of $96 million (2020: asset of $248 million), of which $54 million (2020: $141 million) is in a cash flow hedge relationship, $43 million (2020: $106 million) is in a fair value hedge relationship and $(1) million (2020: $1 million) relates to the currency basis of the cross currency swaps.\n\nThe following tables detail the cross currency swap contracts in hedges outstanding at the end of the reporting period:\n\n|                       | Average interest rate   | Average interest rate   | Average exchange rate   | Average exchange rate   | Contract value (foreign currency)   | Contract value (foreign currency)   | Contract value (local currency)   | Contract value (local currency)   | Fair value/ carrying amount   | Fair value/ carrying amount   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Outstanding contracts | 2021 %                  | 2020 %                  | 2021                    | 2020                    | 2021 $m                             | 2020 $m                             | 2021 $m                           | 2020 $m                           | 2021 $m                       | 2020 $m                       |\n| Buy US dollars        |                         |                         |                         |                         |                                     |                                     |                                   |                                   |                               |                               |\n| 1 to 5 years          | 2.72                    | 3.33                    | 0.888                   | 0.888                   | 300                                 | 165                                 | 338                               | 186                               | 86                            | 68                            |\n| 5 years or more       | 2.73                    | 3.31                    | 0.757                   | 0.787                   | 395                                 | 530                                 | 522                               | 674                               | 10                            | 180                           |\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to foreign currency exchange rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, if the Australian dollar had weakened or strengthened by 10% against the respective foreign currencies where all other variables remain constant, AGL's profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows:\n\n|                           | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                           | 2021 $m                                       | 2020 $m                                       | 2021 $m                                          | 2020 $m                                          |\n| AUD exchange rates +10.0% | -                                             | -                                             | (16)                                             | (11)                                             |\n| AUD exchange rates -10.0% | -                                             | -                                             | 20                                               | 14                                               |\n\n## (g) Energy price risk management\n\nAGL is exposed to energy price risk associated with the purchase and/or sale of electricity, gas, oil and environmental products. AGL manages energy risk through an established risk management framework consisting of policies to place appropriate risk limits on overall energy market exposures and transaction limits for approved energy commodities, requirements for delegations of authority on trading, regular reporting of exposures and segregation of duties.\n\nIt is AGL's policy to actively manage the energy price exposure arising from both forecast energy supply and customer energy load. AGL's risk management policy for energy price risk is to hedge forecast future positions for up to five years into the future.\n\nExposures to fluctuations in the wholesale market energy prices are managed through the use of various types of hedge contracts including derivative financial instruments.\n\n|",

The aggregate notional volumes of the outstanding energy derivatives at 30 June 2021 were nil MWh (2020: 1 million MWh). Energy derivatives are either designated in cash flow hedge relationships or remain non-designated. AGL will only apply hedge accounting to existing energy hedge relationships and will not apply hedge accounting to any new energy derivative arrangements.\n\n|                       | Average purchase price   | Average purchase price   |       |       | Carrying value of outstanding hedging instruments   | Carrying value of outstanding hedging instruments   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Hedging instruments - | 2021                     | 2020                     | 2021  | 2020  | 2021                                                | 2020                                                |\n| outstanding contracts | $                        | $                        | m MWh | m MWh | $m                                                  | $m                                                  |\n| Buy electricity       | -                        | 76.18                    | -     | 1     | -                                                   | (59)                                                |\n\n## Energy derivatives - economic hedges\n\nAGL has entered into certain derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes under the Board-approved risk management policies, which do not satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under AASB 9 Financial Instruments . These derivatives are therefore required to be categorised as held for trading and are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as economic hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss as part of (loss)/gain on fair value of financial instruments.",

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\n## Energy price sensitivity\n\nThe following table details the sensitivity to a 10 percent increase or decrease in the energy contract market forward prices. A sensitivity of 10 percent has been used as this is considered reasonably possible, based on historical data relating to the level of volatility in market prices.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, if the forward prices had been 10 percent higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, AGL's profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows:\n\nOther comprehensive income\n\n|                           | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | increase/(decrease)   | increase/(decrease)   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                           | 2021 $m                                       | 2020 $m                                       | 2021 $m               | 2020 $m               |\n| Energy forward price +10% | (127)                                         | (126)                                         | -                     | 2                     |\n| Energy forward price -10% | 130                                           | 124                                           | -                     | (2)                   |\n\nThe movement in profit after tax is mainly attributable to an increase/decrease in the fair value of certain energy derivative instruments which are not hedge accounted by AGL. The movement in other comprehensive income is due to the reclassification and/or amortisation of historical hedge accounted derivatives.\n\n## (h) Hedge effectiveness\n\nThe following table details the effectiveness of the hedging relationships and the amounts reclassified from hedging reserve to profit or loss:\n\nCash flow hedges\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\n| 2021                                                                    | USD CCIRS $m   | IRS $m   | FX $m   | Energy $m   | USD CCIRS $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------|---------|-------------|----------------|\n| Carrying amount of the hedging instrument                               |                |          |         |             |                |\n| - Assets                                                                | 54             | 13       | 2       | -           | 43             |\n| - Liabilities                                                           | -              | (37)     | (3)     | -           | -              |\n| Total carrying amount of the hedging instrument                         | 54             | (24)     | (1)     | -           | 43             |\n| Change in value of hedging instrument                                   | (87)           | 47       | (1)     | 31          | (63)           |\n| Change in value of hedged item                                          | 87             | (47)     | 1       | (31)        | 66             |\n| Change in value of the hedging instrument recognised in reserve         | (16)           | 18       | -       | -           | n/a            |\n| Amount recognised in profit or loss on discontinued hedge relationships | -              | 2        | -       | -           | -              |\n| Hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss 1                    | -              | -        | -       | -           | (3)            |\n| Amount reclassified from hedge reserve to profit or loss 2              | (71)           | 29       | -       | 31          | n/a            |\n| Balance in cash flow hedge reserve for continuing hedges                | (15)           | (20)     | -       | -           | n/a            |\n\n|",

AGL's exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved counterparties.\n\nTrade and other receivables consist of approximately 3.95 million residential, small business and large commercial and industrial services to customers, in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of customers and, where appropriate, an allowance for expected credit loss is raised. AGL does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer or any group of customers.\n\nAGL limits its exposure to credit risk by investing surplus funds and entering into derivative financial instruments only with approved financial institutions that have a credit rating of at least A from Standard & Poor's and within credit limits assigned to each financial institution. Derivative counterparties are limited to high creditworthy financial institutions and other organisations in the energy industry. AGL also utilises International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements with derivative counterparties in order to limit exposure to credit risk through the netting of amounts receivable from and amounts payable to individual counterparties.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, there was a significant concentration of credit risk with certain counterparties in relation to energy derivatives undertaken in accordance with the AGL's hedging and risk management activities. The carrying amount of the financial assets recognised in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\nAGL does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover this credit risk.\n\n## (j) Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that AGL will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who have established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of AGL's short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.\n\nAGL manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe following table details AGL's remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The amounts are based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities on the earliest date on which AGL can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are at floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period.",

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Financial assets\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets\n\nClassification\n\nAGL classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe classification depends on AGL's business model for managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or other comprehensive income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether AGL has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity instrument at fair value through other comprehensive income. AGL reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\n## Measurement\n\nAt initial recognition, AGL measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on AGL's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which AGL classifies its debt instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt instrument that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.\n- \u00b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Assets that are held for collecting contractual cash flows and through sale on specified dates. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVOCI is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n- \u00b7 Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the statement of profit or loss within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nOn initial recognition, AGL elects to classify each equity instrument as FVTPL or FVOCI. AGL subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where AGL has elected to present fair value gains or losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains or losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when AGL's right to receive payments is established. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Changes in the fair value of equity instrument financial assets classified as FVTPL are recognised in expenses in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Where derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of changes in fair value depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging relationship is revoked, the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nAGL documents at the inception of the hedging transaction the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether the instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. AGL documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of each hedge relationship.\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in profit or loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.\n\n|",

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item on a present value basis from the inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, within other expenses.\n\nWhen option contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, AGL may elect to designate only the intrinsic value of the option contract as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the option contracts are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. Gains or losses related to the time value element of the option are recognised in a cost of hedging reserve.\n\nWhen cross-currency contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, AGL may elect to designate only the change in fair value of the cross-currency contract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the cross-currency contracts are recognised in the cash flow\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nManagement uses their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices and rates.\n\nhedge reserve in equity. The change in the currency basis spread element of the contract that relates to the hedged item is recognised within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within equity. In some cases, AGL may designate the full change in fair value of the cross-currency contract (including currency basis spread) as the hedging instrument. In such cases, the gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in fair value of the entire cross-currency contract are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of hedge contracts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss within expenses.\n- \u00b7 The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within 'finance costs'.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in profit or loss within other expenses.",

Summary of other significant accounting policies\n\nAGL Energy Limited (the Parent Entity) is a company limited by shares incorporated in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The address of its registered office is Level 24, 200 George Street, Sydney NSW 2000 Australia.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the Parent Entity and its controlled entities (together referred to as AGL). For the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent Entity is a for-profit entity.\n\nThe principal activities of AGL are described in Note 1.\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations as issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nThe consolidated financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 12 August 2021.\n\n## (b) Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for derivative financial instruments and equity instrument financial assets, which are measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for assets. All amounts are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional and presentation currency of AGL, unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe Parent Entity is a company of the kind referred to in ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191, dated 24 March 2016, and in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the financial statements are rounded off to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe significant accounting policies that have been adopted in the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below.\n\n## (c) Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and Interpretations\n\nAGL has applied the required amendments to Standards and Interpretations that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current reporting period for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 July 2020. These did not have any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in AGL's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (d) Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Entity and entities (including special purpose entities) controlled by the Parent Entity (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the Parent Entity is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n## (e) Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.\n\nNon-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nForeign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## (f) Standards and Interpretations on issue not yet adopted\n\nThe following accounting standards, accounting standard amendments and interpretations are due for adoption for the year ending 30 June 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 AASB 2014-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards: Sale or Contribution of Assets Between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (AASB 10 and AASB 128)\n- \u00b7 AASB 2020-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Annual Improvements 2018-2020 and Other Amendments (AASB 1, AASB 3, AASB 9, AASB 116, AASB 137and AASB 141)\n\nThe standards and interpretations listed above are not expected to have a material impact on AGL's financial results or financial position on adoption.",

Under the revised accounting policy, costs that would have been previously capitalised are treated as operating expenditure where the entity cannot demonstrate the ability to control the relevant software. In accordance with Australian Accounting Standards the change in accounting policy has been adopted retrospectively and prior comparative periods have been restated. The tables below show the impact of the change in accounting policy on previously reported financial results:\n\n## Impact on Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\n\n|

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 39. Subsequent events\n\n## Powering Australian Renewables Contribution\n\nOn 3 August 2021 AGL completed a $358 million capital contribution into Powering Australian Renewables (PowAR) to fund its 20% interest in PowAR's acquisition of Tilt Renewables Limited's Australian business.\n\n## Updated Segment Reporting\n\nOn 30 June 2021 AGL confirmed its intent to execute a demerger of its retail business and form two listed energy businesses, Accel Energy and AGL Australia. Subsequent to year end, the internal reporting structure of AGL has been updated, effective 1 July 2021, to align to the two new businesses. The new reporting structure will lead to new segments to be disclosed in the financial reports of AGL for the half year ended 31 December 2021 and later reports.\n\n## New Segments\n\nThe new segments are:\n\n- \u00b7 Accel - Operations: comprises the power generation portfolio and other assets of Accel Energy. The segment will include the costs associated with the operation and maintenance of Accel's generation fleet and other assets.\n- \u00b7 Accel - Trading and Origination: comprises the wholesale electricity and C&I customer portfolio of Accel. This segment includes the revenues for the sale of energy to the AGL Australia Customer segment and wholesale and C&I customers, along with costs of generation, and the outcomes of the trading and hedging strategies employed.\n- \u00b7 AGL Australia - Customer: comprises the consumer and large business customer portfolios responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas, solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers and the retailing of telecommunications. This segment includes revenue from the sale of energy, telecommunications and other products to customers, the cost of supply and operating costs to support AGL Australia's 4.2 million customer services.\n- \u00b7 AGL Australia - Supply and Trading: comprises the wholesale electricity, gas and eco markets trading and operating activities of AGL Australia. This segment sources the electricity and gas required to serve AGL Australia's customers. It also operates and maintains the flexible generation assets owned by AGL Australia. This segment earns inter-segment revenues through sales to the AGL Australia Customer segment.\n- \u00b7 AGL Australia - Investments: comprises AGL Australia's interests in the ActewAGL Retail Partnership, Powering Australian Renewables, Energy Impact Partners, Activate Capital Partners, and other investments.\n\n## Segment Methodology\n\nRevenue and costs previously reported as Integrated Energy have been allocated between the segments Accel Energy Operations; Accel Energy Trading & Origination; and AGL Australia Trading & Supply. The allocation methodology mirrors the asset distribution that is expected in the demerger. Where a direct allocation of revenue or costs could not be achieved, AGL has applied the following methodology:\n\n- \u00b7 an allocation was determined using AGL's existing transfer pricing, adjusted for market-based estimates of the transfer of value relating to the new allocation of generation and gas assets, as if these segments had been in place previously and is consistent with the methodology used for reporting to the existing CODM effective 1 July 2021; or\n- \u00b7 an allocation was determined using management's best estimate of the underlying cost structure for each segment under the new segment structure.\n\nFor those Large Business customers remaining with Accel Energy, the revenue and costs which are based on the existing transfer price associated with these customers historically recorded within Customer Markets have been included within Accel Energy Trading & Origination.\n\nWhilst the allocation of revenue or costs does not result in any change in the underlying performance of the AGL Group, the identification of new segments has resulted in an increase in inter-segment revenue. This relates to some intra-segment transactions primarily within the existing Integrated Energy segment which were previously eliminated and are now recognised as inter-segment transactions between the newly created segments.\n\nThe tables below include the financial results for the years ended 30 June 2021, 2020 and 2019 presented on a basis consistent with the new segment structure. Other segment disclosures not included below are consistent with those in Note 1.",

Our  responsibilities  under  those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of this report.  We  are  independent  of  the  Group  in  accordance  with  the  auditor  independence  requirements  of  the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the 'Code') that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\nWe confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001 , which has been given to the directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor's report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nLiability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation.

The other information comprises the information included in the Company's annual report for the year ended 30 June 2021, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in  accordance with Australian Accounting Standards  and the Corporations Act 2001 and  for  such  internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objectives are to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  report  as  a  whole  is  free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.",

However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and  whether  the  financial  report  represents  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  financial  report.  We  are  responsible  for  the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matt er or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on the Remuneration Report\n\nOpinion on the Remuneration Report\n\nWe have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 65 to 89 of the D irectors' Report for the year ended 30 June 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the Remuneration Report of AGL Energy Limited, for the year ended 30 June 2021 complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.\n\n|",

A limited assurance engagement is  substantially  less  in  scope  than  a  reasonable  assurance  engagement  in  relation  to  both  the  risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.  Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the subject matter information has been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance the Reporting Criteria.",

Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given both its nature and the methods used for determining, calculating, and sampling or estimating such data.\n\n## Restricted Use\n\nThis report has been prepared for use by the management of AGL for the purpose of assisting directors and management in their reporting of the Selected Annual KPI scorecard disclosures. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report or on the Subject Matter to which it relates, to any person other than the management of AGL or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.\n\n## Matters relating to electronic presentation of information\n\nIt is our understanding that AGL may publish a copy of our report on their website. We do not accept responsibility for the electronic presentation of our report on the AGL website. The security and controls over  information  on  the  web  site  is  not  evaluated  or  addressed  by  the  independent  auditor.  The examination of the controls over the electronic presentation of this Report on the AGL web site is beyond the scope of this engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDELOITTE TOUCHE TOHMATSU\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nP Dobson Partner\n\nSydney, 12 August 2021\n\n|",

The dividend will operate on a fully underwritten basis.

Payments are electronically credited on the dividend payment date and confirmed by a mailed or electronic payment advice. Payment instructions can either be lodged online or an appropriate form can be downloaded from Computershare's website.\n\n## Dividend Reinvestment Plan\n\nAGL offers shareholders the opportunity to participate in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Shares are allocated under the Plan, free of transaction costs. The rate of discount, if any, applied to shares allocated under the Plan will be determined by the Directors at the\n\ntime each dividend is declared. A zero discount was applied to the 2021 interim dividend and a 1.5% discount will apply to the 2021 final dividend.\n\n## On-market share buy-back and shares purchased onmarket\n\nAGL Energy is not currently undertaking an on-market share buyback.\n\nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2021, 706,825 AGL shares were purchased on-market at an average price of $13.45 per share to satisfy employee entitlements under the AGL Share Reward Plan, AGL Share Purchase Plan, AGL Restricted Equity Plan and the AGL Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n\n## Reporting to shareholders\n\nThe Corporations Act requires AGL to provide shareholders with access to this Annual Report on AGL's website, unless a shareholder has specifically requested to be sent a printed copy.

All such changes must be advised online or in writing and cannot be accepted by telephone. For a change of name, supporting documentation must accompany your written advice. Appropriate forms can also be downloaded from the Share Registry's website.\n\nShareholders who are CHESS Sponsored should instruct their sponsoring broker in writing to notify the Share Registry of any change.\n\n## Tax File Number (TFN)/Australian Business Number (ABN)\n\nIt is not compulsory to provide a TFN or ABN. However AGL will be required to deduct tax at the top marginal rate from the unfranked portion of any dividend paid to shareholders who have not provided either a TFN/ABN or details of a relevant TFN exemption. TFN/ABN notification forms can be obtained by contacting the Share Registry, by lodging your details online or by downloading the appropriate form from the Share Registry's website.\n\n## Consolidation of shareholdings\n\nShareholders who wish to consolidate multiple shareholdings into a single shareholding should advise the Share Registry or their sponsoring broker, whichever is applicable, in writing.\n\n## Company Secretaries\n\nJohn Fitzgerald BA MA LLB Melinda Hunter BCom LLB",

AGL Energy's NPS is measured quarterly via an external survey that asks customers across all energy retailers 'On a scale of 0-10, how likely is it that you would recommend Retailer X to a friend or colleague?' The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of zeros to sixes from the percentage of nines and tens. The performance measure relates to the NPS measured in Q4 of the reporting year. In April 21, AGL Energy moved to a new survey supplier to collect NPS. The survey methodology used by the new supplier is consistent with the previous survey approach.                                                                          |\n| Ombudsman complaints                                     | Reported figures represent complaints to the various state energy Ombudsman offices that are provided to AGL Energy for resolution.
