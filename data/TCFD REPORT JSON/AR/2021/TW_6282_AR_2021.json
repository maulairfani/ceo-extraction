This affected services, manufacturing and transportation services and resulted in the poor performance of the global economy. The most recent forecast by the IMF (International Monetary Fund) for the global economic growth is 4.4%, down slightly from the previous forecast of 4.9%. That said, the availability of vaccines and the coverage of vaccinations have effectively eased of the pandemic. The IMF forecasts the growth in developed economies to exceed the pre-COVID level in 2024. We have deployed anti-COVID measures by referring to the past experience in order to deal with the uncertainties and the impact of the pandemic and the supply chain instability. We also continued to communicate stakeholders and effectively mitigated the effect on operations. With all these efforts, our revenue this year grew from last year. We report to our shareholders here with sincerity our 2021 operational achievements and 2022 business outlook.\n\n## 2021 Operating Results\n\nThe annual revenue reached NT$21.906 billion, up by 4.4% from the previous year. The annual net income was NT$602 million and the earnings per share was NT$1.17. An internal antiCOVID mechanism has been put in place, due to the pandemic and the supply chain instability through the year. The measures adopted include personnel protection, staff management and staggered shifts. The external communication with customers regarding demand and supply, surveys on the supply chain and transportation coordination effectively mitigated the pandemic impacts. COVID-19 has changed the human mobility and work patterns. Home working drives the shipment of notebook computers, data center servers, storage and networking equipment. By the end of last year, we have been awarded tenders for about 700,000 smart meters and we have delivered nearly 600,000 units to date. We continue to develop smart grid technology and capabilities, in alignment with the policy. We have also made good progress in new energy. The accumulated solar generation installations reached 145MWp in capacity and have generated 91MWh. We continue to work with leading players for the development of motor drivers of electric vehicles and we expect to pass the verification and ship in small quantities this year. We are also collaborating with renowned electric motorbike makers in the power management system for battery swapping stations. In sum, we strive to become a total-solution integrated platform for power services.\n\nAcBel has been recognized for our efforts in corporate governance and corporate social responsibility. We received as a Top 50 Corporate Sustainability Award in the 14 th Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Award (TCSA); TCSA Corporate Sustainability Report Award for",

Our TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) report was verified by third parties and rated as a pioneer, the highest level. All these awards and prizes are a testimony of AcBel's dedication to returning to the society and commitment in corporate social responsibility.\n\n## Business Environment and Development Strategies\n\nAcBel upholds the commitment of \"We Power the World with Sustainable/Renewable Energy and High Efficiency Power Supply\", will take its own research and development efficiency as the core in the future, join the concept of providing positive energy of the earth, and strive to create the maximum value for customers, employees and shareholders. In combination of strong R&D momentum, we step into the application of the areas of clean energy, solar power plant, medical equipment and electric vehicle related power products, with a view to become the innovative leading company of smart green energy in the power industry.\n\n## 2022 Operating Prospect\n\nWe are developing our business in three domains: power supply for consumers and industries, new energy, and e-mobility. In the power supply market for consumers and industries, we anticipate continued growth in the  consumer segment driven by applications such as smart homes, notebook computers, e-sports, IoTs (Internet-of-Things) and surveillance systems. The industrial power supply segment will see rapid expansion in the market size and orders from customers due to growth in data centers, artificial intelligence, Big Data analytics driven by gradual maturing of 5G use cases and higher penetration of electric motorcycles and vehicles. The Company's sales of power supply products are expected to be 91,339 thousand units this year. The fuel cell market is seeing increasing awareness in sustainability for the environment and  the  economy.  All  the  countries  in  the  world  are  developing  clean  energy.  Our  key international customers are enjoying higher market shares and gradually completing capacity plans in Taiwan. This underpins our year-over-year growth in power supply products. In addition to power supply products, we are also engaged in the integration and assembly services of power supply systems, to boost gross profits and revenues.\n\nThe construction of the new Tamsui plant began in January 2020. The pandemic disrupted the original plan for completion at the end of 2021. Currently, ramp-up is scheduled for the third quarter of 2022 with smart production lines and relevant facilities across the board. This is expected to boost revenues and profits. Once the new plant starts production, an application will be submitted to reconstruct the old plant. Hopefully the revamped capacities will join production up over the next two to three years.\n\nGoing forward, we will focus on the technological deepening of 5G communication, on -board",

The purpose of establishing the internal control system is to reasonably assure the following objectives: (a) The effectiveness and efficiency of business operation (including earnings,  operation  performance  and  the  safeguard  of  company  assets);  (b)  the  reliability, timeliness, transparency of report; and (c) Achieve compliance objectives according to the relevant laws and regulations in order to provide reasonable assurances.\n- III. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control system design and implementation is made in accordance with the Guidelines for the Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies (the Guidelines). The Guidelines are made to examine the following five factors during the management and control process: (1) control environment, (2) risk assessment and response, (3) control activities, (4) information and communication, and (5) supervision. Each factor also includes several items. Please refer to the Guidelines for the preceding items.\n- II. Due to the innate limitation in designing a faultless internal control system, this system can only assure the reasonableness of the above three objectives has been fairly achieved. In addition, the effectiveness of the internal control system could alter over time due to the change of business environment or situation. Since the Company's internal control system is provided with a selfmonitoring mechanism, the Company will take corrective actions in response to any identified deficiencies.\n- IV.

If any of the disclosed contents above contains false information or omits any material content, the Company will involve legal liability under Article 20, Article 32, Article 171 and Article 174 set forth in the Security and Exchange Act.\n- V. V.

Dividend policy adopted in the Company's Articles of Incorporation\n\nThe Company may authorize the Board of Directors to distribute dividends and bonuses, capital reserves or statutory surplus reserves payable in cash in whole or in part by a resolution of a majority vote at a meeting of the Board of Directors attended by two-thirds or more of the total number of Directors, and report to the shareholders' meeting.\n\n- In accordance with Article 26-1 of the Articles of Incorporation, if there are any earnings after the Company's annual closing of the books, the Company shall first pay all taxes and dues and cover accumulated losses, then appropriate 10% of the earnings as the statutory surplus reserve; provided that this restriction shall not apply if the statutory surplus reserve has reached the paid-in capital of the Company. The Company shall make provision or reversal for special surplus reserve from the remaining earnings as required by law or by the provisions of competent authorities. If there is still a balance, the Board of Directors shall draw up an earnings distribution plan for the balance and the undistributed retained earnings at the beginning of the period, and submit it to the board of shareholders for a resolution on distribution.\n\nThe Company is at a stage of steady growth. In consideration of the Company's future capital needs and to meet the needs of shareholders for cash inflows, the annual cash dividend paid shall not be less than 50% of the total cash and stock dividends paid in the current year if there are earnings available for distribution after the Company's annual closing of the books.\n\n- In accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, the Company may authorize the Board of Directors to distribute dividends and bonuses payable in cash in whole or in part by a resolution of a majority vote at a meeting of the Board of Directors attended by two-thirds or more of the total number of Directors, and report to the shareholders' meeting.\n- 2. Dividend distributions proposed at the Shareholders' Meeting\n- The Company's cash dividends distributed from earnings in 2021 have been passed by the Board of Directors on March 11, 2022. The shareholder dividends distributed from earnings is NT$516,621,295, which was paid in cash in NT$1.00 per share.\n- Although the Articles of Association does not specify the distribution of shareholders dividends, the Company's Board of Directors shall, taking into account the financial structure of the Company and the need to expand the scale of operations in the future, allocate at least 30% of the net profit after tax of the current period for the annual books closing years as cash dividends in the earnings distribution plan for the next three years.\n- The Board of Directors shall authorize the chairman to handle the current cash dividend distributed from earnings discretionarily if the number of outstanding shares is subsequently affected by the Company's repurchase or recovery of its own shares, cancellation of the share capital or other factors, resulting in changes in the shareholders' allocation ratio which need to be corrected.\n- 3.

        "page_content": "## (II) Industrial Overview\n\n## 1. The Current Status and Development of the Industry\n\n## (1) Power Supply Industry\n\nThe Power Supply is designed to provide stable power supply with appropriate voltage or current for electronic products, and is one of the indispensable functional components. According to the different functions and basic structure of products, it can be divided into two categories: Linear Power Supply (LPS) and Switching Power Supply (SPS).\n\nThe advantages to use SPS include providing products with low loss, small volume, lightweight, which is in line with the development trend of light, thin and short terminal products and energysaving and environmental protection, and providing a wider range of external imputable voltages than an LPS, and providing the performance of higher power density/conversion efficiency, all of which contribute to wider application scope. The scope of products includes chargers, rectifiers, converters, inverters and an Uninterrupted Power System (UPS).\n\nAt  present,  domestic  SPS  manufacturers  are  facing  low  price  competition  from  Chinese manufacturers in the PC and consumer electronic device charger market. Together with the saturated PC market, manufacturers are facing an environment with severe challenges. In terms of data center application, as affected by the epidemic, the construction layout was restricted this year. However, the market for servers and Networking and Telecom products is still booming due to the development of 5G and the demand for work from home and web-based conferencing due to the epidemic. The transfer of most customer orders to Taiwan under the condition of risks hedging as a result of the trade war between China and the United States, the United States sanctions to ban Huawei and SMIC from the American market and the digitization of energy vehicles have further caused the market panic  and  material  market  shortage.  The  change  of  the  external  environment  stimulates  the traditional electronics industry to be a hot industry. As the Company is located in the technology island Taiwan, an adequate supply chain is available for us to provide complete solutions to various emerging industries. With mature AI, further integration of IoT into a new generation of AIoT applications and the introduction of 5G, in addition to traditional computing center applications, Open Source IT servers and Networking and Telecom equipment will be further applied to 5G infrastructure to meet the needs of Edge Computing. Global data center hardware demand is expected to continue to grow. Under the steady growth of the global server and communication equipment market,  domestic  SPS  manufacturers  have  shifted  their  product  strategies  to  develop  servers, workstations, and power suppliers for Networking and Telecom equipment in recent years. The application of such power supplies has led to a trend towards commodity standardization, resulting in lower barriers to enter the market and fiercer competition than ever before. In the low-end SME market, some Chinese manufacturers also began to develop related products and conduct a low-price competition. However, affected by the intensified trade war between China and the United States, telecoms vendors change to adopt open hardware due to information security factors in the 5G infrastructure equipment market and data center equipment market in Europe and the United States. It is expected that in the future, domestic SPS manufacturers will compete in the open hardware market for telecommunications and surveillance, as well as in the high-end and mid-end market, in addition to the mid-end and low-end standardized product market in the professional application fields such as servers, storage and Networking and Telecom equipment. Furthermore, manufacturers are also investing in product development of the green energy conversion market, which was formerly dominated by European, American and Japanese manufacturers, expecting to find new outlets through the extension of power electronics technology.\n\nThe infrastructure of a data center includes servers, switches, storage, routers, and communications power. In particular, the demand for power supply of routers and switches is growing continuously. In terms of high-end and mid-end power supply, while the power supply and power density are increasing, the Power Factor (PF), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and conversion efficiency of power supply has become the basic technical indexes of power supply. Meanwhile, new applications such as IT equipment power supply, edge computing server power supply, cabinet-level power supply, integrated HVDC input, 48V DC input/output, PoE and integrated backup batteries applied to 5G infrastructure are the direction of technology development.\n\nWith society gradually entering an aging society, the demand for personal home care and various medical equipment used in hospitals has also increased. In addition, the wide application of the cloud",

        "page_content": "has deepened the integration of medical products with the cloud application. In recent years, domestic medical manufacturers have combined medical products with cloud monitoring, making home care more accessible. Therefore, the application of medical products has gradually expanded from medical institutions to home use, as a result, the medical product market is growing year by year.  If  the  standard  product  can  be  horizontally  constructed,  there  will  be  more  application opportunities in the future.\n\nIn addition to medical care, training for fitness has become increasingly popular during recent years. Whilst many gyms closed down during the pandemic and consumers purchased equipment to exercise at home, people will return to outdoors for sports once COVID-19 is behind us. Smart fitness equipment serves as an important bridge between the real world and the metaverse. The industry is expecting a return-to-normal growth curve. Smart fitness equipment empowered with consumer electronics technology provides more functions. The integration with online communities enhances the consumers' willingness to use and stickiness. Going digital and smart also brings business opportunities for power supplies. Microcomputers, tablets and large screens that provide interactive functions and motors that simulate real motion all require extra power to drive.\n\nThe variety of agricultural and horticulture machinery, traditionally running on internal combustion engines, is moving towards electrification amid the trend for zero carbon emissions and driverless. The charging infrastructure and the demand for chargers will emerge as a new market.\n\nIn terms of personal electronic devices, the emergence of new USB Type-C and USB PD, QC, PPS and  other  universal  external  power  supply/charger  supporting  variable  voltage,  USB  Type-C interface terminals have become a standard in consumer electronic products. With the demand for fast charging and the maturity of new components, the power density of high-end products has exceeded 1W/CC, and the power has also moved up from 10W-20W to 65W or even higher, and the output terminals have also increased from one group to multiple groups. Moreover, with the hot news that the European Union has been working on a regulation that would require smartphones to be shipped without chargers in their boxes, and some mobile phone companies have taken the lead in cancel charger to be packed in the box in 2020, we will continue to observe whether other brands will follow up in the future. If such states become a trend, the production and marketing mode of chargers must be substantially changed.\n\nIn the smart grid market, the demand for smart meters is increasing due to energy shortages and rising  environmental  awareness.  Teclast  is  also  accelerating  the  deployment  of  smart  meters, including meters, communication solutions and data processing platforms. And the Company has also started to deploy the market of smart meters in Southeast Asia, where the market is growing.\n\nThe Company integrates multiple smart solutions, such as energy gateways, renewable energy and energy storage equipment, and digitizes and visualizes all devices to generate various services creating a new business model. As a result, a number of energy management system (EMS) solutions have emerged on the market, offering an operating model in addition to device sales. In an era when everything is connected to the Internet, the digitization and intelligence of energy products are unstoppable.\n\nWith the development of AI artificial intelligence, 5G communication system, edge computing and cloud computing technology, and based on the overall strategy for innovation and development of the new generation of the data center, the requirements of high power, high integration, modular and open computing architecture have a significant impact on the design of data center, which requires more common power modules and shell design to the data center. At present, most of the inverter systems in the mainstream market adopt a centralized design. However, the design concept of the modular and expandable shell will innovate the application of inverter systems in the data center, and such design thinking is also the future trend of related inverter products.\n\n## (2) Solar farm industry\n\nDue to the impact of COVID-19, the global supply chain, end market target capacity and final shipments in the solar industry are highly uncertain. In 2021, all countries in the world proposed netzero carbon emission transformation policies to promote industrial transformation, and 134 countries have pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It is estimated that the sustainable industry market will drive US$90 trillion in business opportunities within 35 years. The United States intends to increase solar power generation to 40%, and is expected to invest two trillion dollars to \"rebuild a better future.\" Japan published the draft of Strategic Energy Plan, aiming to double the proportion of renewable energy power generation within 10 years, which will make Japan surpass",

        "page_content": "Taiwan and become the biggest player of offshore wind power generation in Asia, and it's renewable energy market will continue to grow. Meanwhile, the European Union proposed a climate neutrality plan, which will impose a carbon tariff (CBAM) on energy intensive products imported into the EU from 2023. The first stage will focus on high-polluting industries, such as cement, fertilizer, steel, aluminum and electricity, and the second stage may include the electronics industry. .\n\nEnergy transformation drives the development of the green energy industry. Energy generation, energy storage, energy conservation and smart system integration have become the four major pillars of Taiwan's future renewable energy development. President Tsai Ing-wen announced that Taiwan will move towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Executive Yuan revised the \"Climate Change Response Act\", which will implement a carbon pricing system and impose carbon fees in 2023. The National Development Council will propose a net-carbon emission road map for Taiwan, promoting revisions of regulations and policy support from seven major aspects, i.e., wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, ocean nergy, hydrogen energy, energy storage and carbon sink. In response to the EU's carbon tariffs and the needs of sustainable development, the private sector has also begun to take action. Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan Cement, China Steel Corporation and other energy intensive industries have fully configured renewable energy. Big electric furnace manufacturers, such as Fenghsin, Haikwang and Weichih, are actively installing solar photovoltaic equipment.\n\nWith the introduction of the High Energy User Clause, the transaction volume of green engergy reached about 600 million kWh in 2021, an increase of more than 11 times over the previous year, among which 80% were from land-based wind power generation. The installed capacity of private power plants that can be put into the market is about 1.4 GW, accounting for 13% of the total capacity, and there is still room for growth. The energy storage industry is also in rapid development. In order to stabilize the power supply, Taipower has increased the target capacity of the energy storage system to 1GW. Many companies, such as Tatung Company, Delta Electronics, Ancillary Power and Aerospace  Industrial  Development  Corporation,  have  invested  in  Taipower's  auxiliary  service market. After the launch of the Taiwan Electricity Trading Platform in October, the total trading volume exceeded 20,000MWh in the first three months, and the transaction amount was more than NT$18 million. The potential for future business opportunities worths tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe original target of Taiwan's energy policy is that renewable energy accounts for 20% in 2025. However, due to factors, such as economic growth, the return of Taiwanese enterprises and the expansion of semiconductor foundries, electricity consumption is expected to increase significantly, making renewable energy only account for 15.2% in 2025. To achieve the original target of 20% renewable energy, the domestic demand market needs to continue to grow. In line with the \"New Southbound  Policy\"  that  aims  to  link  with  local  industries  in  Southeast  Asian  countries,  the government has also esteblished the 'System Integration Promotion Alliance (SIPA) Project Office' to encourage private sectors to export Taiwan's solar energy system in order to promote downstrean integration of Taiwan's solar industry. However, due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global supply chain, more attention should be paid to the rising trend of installation costs caused by price fluctuation of raw materials and solar modules.\n\nIn the foreseeable future, the net-zero carbon emission path and domestic policy support will drive the renewable energy market. Taiwan should deepen its technological advantages, accelerate the transformation of the energy industry, strengthen the supply chain, and take a two-pronged approach to win international customers while driving the growth of the domestic market.\n\n## (3) Electric Vehicle Industry\n\nWith the rapid development of battery and automobile technology, it is possible to replace gasoline with electricity as the main source of power for vehicles. Electric vehicles are vehicles that use batteries as energy storage and power supply and are driven by motors. Electric vehicles can be divided into BEVs (battery electric vehicles), HEVs (hybrid electric vehicles), PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) and REEVs (extended range electric vehicles) according to different power supply methods and ratio. In addition, there are other vehicles, such as fuel cell vehicles or solar cell vehicles, that can generate energy on their own.\n\nFrom the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement, to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, led by European countries, countries around the world have begun to have constructive discussions and systematic measurement standards on environmental protection issues, especially on tracking and measuring greenhouse gas emissions, use of renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate",

The current global carbon emission target is 40% reduction from 2015 to 2025, among which the European vehicle target of 59 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer in 2030 is the most stringent. Governments have also gradually issued timetables for banning the sale of fuel vehicles. For example, Norway and the Netherlands are expected to completely ban the sale of new fuel vehicles in 2025; and Germany will only approve license for zero-carbon vehicles after 2030, and have internal combustion engine (ICE) banned on the road after 2050. Japan has raised its 2030 carbon reduction target from 26% to 46%, and will ban the sale of fuel vehicles in 2035. In response to these carbon reduction policies, large car manufacturers have increased the proportion of electric vehicles in their product lines in order to meet the deadline and limits of carbon emissions in various countries. In order to achieve carbon reduction goals, countries have also provided various subsidy programs to electric vehicle manufacturers and customers to stimulate the growth of electric vehicle sales. According to the global electric vehicle sales data released by the Industrial Technology Research Institute in September 2021, statistics showed a record high increase of 85% in 2021 compared with 2020. Mainland China (32.5%), Japan (17.9%), the United States (16.3%), Germany (7.9%) and the United Kingdom (5%) were the top five countries based on the sales volume. The growth of electric vehicle sales will continue in 2022, but with the combined factors of increase in the base period, impact of COVID-19 and supply chain insufficiency, the annual growth rate is estimated to be 45% only. According to the Global EV Outlook released by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the number of electric vehicles, electric buses, electric lorries and electric trucks is expected to reach 145 million in 2030. The IEA believes that the number of electric vehicles in the world will continue to increase and is expected to reach 230 million in the next 10 years with vigorous promotion of international energy and climate goals by the governments around the world.\n\n## 2. The Links between the Upstream, Midstream, and Downstream Segments of the Industry Supply Chain Links between upstream raw materials and the industry\n\nThe main raw materials of switching power supply can be broadly classified as active components, passive components, magnetic components, other electronic components, housing and printed circuit boards. Control ICs for active components and power semiconductors are mostly supplied from the USA and Japan, while passive components and magnetic materials, except for special cores for transformers, can be made at home, which is rather highly homemade in domestic electronics industry. On the other hand, as the power management function becomes more and more important in the future, Micro Controller or DSP chip will become an indispensable key component in the application of highend power supply.\n\n## Links between downstream application products and switching power supplies\n\nSwitching power supply produced in Taiwan is mainly applied in communication products, computers and peripheral equipment. With the rapid development of the computer and information industry, there is a number of domestic information products ranked first of output in the world, one of which is the switching power supply. Just because of this, the power supply is an indispensable component of downstream  communication  products  and  computer  peripherals,  network  equipment,  consumer electronics and industrial equipment, and thus bringing a lot of business opportunities for the power supply industry. As the demand for data centers expands and with the cloud computing effect, the demand for power supply applications in data centers is also growing rapidly. The emerging smart electricity and LED lighting industry also boost the market demand for smart meters and special power for smart lighting.",

The structure of the upstream, midstream and downstream of the industry is shown as follows:\n\nIndustry Structure of Switching Power Supply\n\n## Upstream Raw Materials\n\nSPS Manufacturing\n\nDownstream Application Industry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbout the EV industry, the upstream of the electric vehicle industry chain includes suppliers of battery materials, component materials and automotive chip suppliers; the midstream is composed of supplier of electric vehicle components (such as battery cells/modules, power motors/modules, automotive components/modules  and  power  supply  modules)  and  sub-system/system  suppliers;  and  the downstream is suppliers of electric vehicles and electric bicycles.\n\nThe downstream of electric vehicles can be divided into two categories. One is passenger vehicles, which are closer to the public. The market leaders are Tesla, Toyota, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Audi, BYD, NIO and Nissan. The other is commercial vehicles, such as Ford, Mercedes-Benz, GM, Volkswagen and startups, such as Rivian, Arrival and Bollinger.\n\nIn recent years, the global electric vehicle market has grown significantly, which has led to an increase in the demand for automotive chips. However, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, there has been a shortage in automotive chips as a result of three reasons: (1) disruption of the supply chain, including reduction in production, interruption of supply chain, shipping congestion and prolonged delivery times due to the pandemic, (2) temporary inability of fabs to supply sufficient goods owing to increase in the use  of  electric  equipment,  such  as  sensors,  display  panels,  microcontroller  in  electric  vehicles, microcontrollers and power management chips; and (3) increased order for smooth delivery for the sake of prolonged delivery time. According to the statistics provided by IC Insights, the shipment of automotive chips in 2021 was 52.4 billion, equivalent to an annual increase of 30%, and Infineon and NXP are still the top one and two leaders in terms of market share. Automakers expect that a nearly two-year shortage of automotive chips will ease in the second half of 2022.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Trends of Products\n\nBase on the demand for AIoT and 5G infrastructure equipment, Taiwan's SPS product development can be divided into two aspects: 1) the technology development is towards the field of high efficiency, multiple input voltage, wider operating temperature, intelligence. The equipment traditionally used in data centers, including servers, Networking and Telecom equipment for enterprises, and storage equipment, is also being applied to the communications room and base station environment. Modular design is adopted for products, parallel stacking mode (500W+500W+...) is applied, the application range of products is expanded (low-end, mid-end and high-end power), all of which has significantly shortened the product development cycle; 2) the product is developed as light, thin, short and small. The main market is the consumer end of cloud computing, such as smart mobile phones, notebook computers, tablet computers, etc., and small power suppliers applied in 3C products. Looking forward to the future, the market demand for small, light, energy-saving and low-cost products will continue to increase. With the adoption of smart and portable communication products in large numbers, the appearance of the products becomes smaller and thinner, with the advantages of being portable. Endusers  have  to  connect  with  the  cloud  through  the  network  and  service  providers  who  provide information with computing capacity, which directly stimulates the cloud service providers to build a large number of data centers. Under the convergence environment of 5G data and communication, both Telecom operators and network service providers must actively expand network equipment to meet the needs of users and AIoT equipment for information services, which will promote the growth of the market and form a virtuous cycle. Networking and Telecom equipment and consumer electronics products have become the most important market for SPS.\n\nThe global power supply for desktop personal computers has been well developed. In 2020, under the impact of the epidemic, the industry shows signs of accelerating decline and poor outlook of the market on the whole. The high level of standardization has forced desktop PC vendor manufacturers to expand their market share through price competition that drives down costs and mass production capacity. On the other hand, the market acceptance for beautiful and convenient All In One computer is increasing. Despite the recession, the market is still growing faster than traditional desktop PCs. In addition to basic applications, e-sports PC requires stable dynamic responses and high power output as a result of adopting high-efficiency GPU for lots of computing, and there will be room for growth in power supplies for such special applications.\n\nPortable PCs, such as notebook computers, account for a large portion of current PC shipments. Under the influence of the epidemic, the market for laptop computers has grown rapidly due to the demand for remote offices and education. This type of power supply is designed in the form of a portable Adapter. With the M-type development of the market, the main growth markets are e-sports laptops above 150W and ultra-thin laptops with a low power consumption of 65W and 45W. High-end products below 65W tend to be gradually replaced by USB Type-C PD chargers due to the thin and light needs of the products. In terms of tablet computers and smart mobile phones, converters with lower power were mainly used in the past, or Charger was designed to adjust the output voltage to achieve a fastcharging function. The output power is developed to 65W or above, which can be applied to various consumer  electronic  products.  A  large  number  of  automation  processes  must  be  adopted  in manufacturing to reduce costs. Once the EU Act on Standardization of Mobile Phone Chargers is implemented, the mobile phone charger market is bound to be affected. In addition, the new Act on Efficiency Improvement Requirements for External Power Supply raised by the EU and the U.S. Department of Energy come into force in 2016, and higher conversion efficiency will also be a basic indicator. Last but not the least, in addition to the traditional single-voltage output products, the multifunctional power converters conforming to USB Power Delivery specifications can provide different voltage outputs, which can be applied in a variety of consumer electronic products. In 2020, mobile devices equipped with USB Type-C have become the mainstream products in the market. However, as the majority of users still own traditional USB Type-A or Micro USB devices, the market for small external power supplies/chargers with multiple USB charging ports continues to grow.\n\nThe technology of power supplies for personal computers extends upward to servers, large Networking, Telecom equipment and storage devices. With the rapid development of cloud computing, mid-end and low-end servers tend to be matured after years of rapid growth in recent years. Although the technology, complexity and stability of the power supply applied in servers are higher than those applied in PC power supply, as servers move towards a standardized single architecture, the power supply also moves towards standardization due to the high commercialization of the mid-end and low-end systems. As a",

        "page_content": "result, it is difficult for manufacturers to increase unit prices through differentiation. Therefore, in order to reduce the overall development cost, it tends to adopt the standardized design for power supply and reduce the number of parts and automatic production to improve the reliability.\n\nIn response to the large number of servers deployed in a single location by the data center, the product tends to gradually shift from continuous efficiency improvement of a single power supply to systematic optimization of smart power management and cabinet power architecture, enhance the power factor of power supply and reduce total harmonic distortion through the introduction of digital control. In recent years, with production and R&D bases of servers, large Networking and Telecom equipment and storage  equipment  moving  to  China  and  Taiwan,  Taiwan  power  supply  manufacturer  actively developing  their  design  capabilities  with  relatively  lower  price  pressure  compared  to  European, American  and  Japanese  manufacturers,  power  supplies  for  mid-end  and  low-end  servers,  large Networking  and  Telecom  equipments  and  storage  equipments  have  been  mainly  designed  and manufactured by Taiwan manufacturers. The server power supply market is becoming mature due to the advances in virtualization and cloud computing technology and the rise of distributed power architecture. The market for dedicated storage devices has also been hit by Intel-Based storage servers and cloud storage solutions. Under the decline of terminal application, the growth momentum of the market has shifted to Networking and Telecom  equipment as the focus. Base on the AIOT's edge computing requirements and as it is expected to adopt a large number of IT servers and Networking and Telecom equipment for 5G infrastructure, the IT system and power supply in line with the environmental  standards  of  telecommunications  equipment  and  computer  room  will  drive  the development of a new generation of products in the future.\n\nPower supply for communication mostly adopts Distributed Power Architecture, which usually consists of an AC-DC Rectifier supplying the busbar voltage and a DC/DC Converter at the later stage. Such kinds of products are of high technology and with great importance attaching to product reliability. On the whole structure, it can reduce costs and improve efficiency by reducing the times of power conversion. The rectifier sector also develops toward high efficiency, high density. In consideration of costs of DC-DC converter at the later stage, traditional high-end isolated converters tend to be replaced by non-isolated converters (POLs) with lower cost. For bus bar voltage, with the rise of new energy sources and the application of data centers, more efficient HVDC systems sprung up in the market. The emergence of different architectures and applications is expected to create new growth momentum in the highly standardized telecommunications power supply market.\n\nGiven the rising awareness about environmental protection, the opposition of nuclear and the call for phasing out nuclear, the pursuit of zero carbon, the reduction use of fossils fuels and the increase of green energy contribute to the growing importance of electricity grid stability and the efficient use of energy.      Smart meters may enable power companies to keep track of trends in electricity consumption in a timely manner and dispatch limited power resources more efficiently. Replacing the traditional meters in every household with smart meters with communication function is the most basic and important step, which is also a necessary step.\n\nEnergy management services can inject new energy into all energy products. In addition to smart meters, if all kinds of grid-connected power generation devices, energy storage systems, renewable energy power plants or related products can be introduced through energy management system (EMS) and demand control technology, the sales value of products in the power supply market can be doubled.\n\nWith the popularity of cloud computing and big data applications, data centers are becoming largescale, which also leads to a significant increase in the purchase of relevant power systems. OCP (Open Compute Project, initiated by Facebook, etc.), ODCC (Open Data Center Committee, initiated by BAT), Open19 (Open Data Center, initiated by LinkedIn) and other open computing organizations are playing a major role in driving innovation in the data center field, all of which have come up with a reference specification for modular cabinet design. In consideration of standardized cabinet design is a trend in the design of power converters applied for data centers, the design of modular converter module and expandable  cabinet  is  proposed,  which  will  enable  the  related  products  to  meet  the  functional requirements of major data center manufacturers.\n\nAbout the EV industry, the supply chain has undergone tremendous changes after Tesla launched platform-based and modular production. Take the electric vehicle electronic control field covered by the company as an example, it has gradually moved from individual components (such as on-board chargers, motor controllers, DC converters) to an integrated design (all-in-one electronic control products). The integrated design enables the design of the mechanism and the appearance to be shared to achieve a",

        "page_content": "miniaturized design and increase the power density. To improve the mileage and charging speed of electric vehicles, battery modules and electronic control systems continue to evolve towards 800V high voltage. The 800V high voltage platform launched by Porsche is marking the start of high voltage era. For the batteries in electric vehicles, mainstream electric vehicles manufacturers around the world use high energy density lithium batteries as an important driving force for expanding the territory of electric vehicles. However, even though the prospects of lithium batteries are promising, the market still hopes to develop new batteries that have higher energy density and higher safety that lithium batteries because numerous charge and discharge can easily affect the lifespan of lithium batteries and there are concerns for inflammation. Among them, the development of solid-state batteries and fuel cells has received the most attention. The development of electronic vehicle motors is also moving towards integration. Motor, transmissions and motor controllers are integrated and combined with artificial intelligence and big data for control.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the main customers of in-vehicle products of electric vehicles are from America and Japan, and their models are primarily sold in American and Asia. The principal competitor in Taiwan is Delta Electronics. Facing the huge business opportunities in the electric vehicle market, we are in a very favorable position. With the launch of all-in-one integrated products, the application of next-generation compound semiconductors and the continuous accumulation of R&D technologies, the automotive products are expected to have a long-term growth. However, attention should be paid to the shortage of components and long delivery time of semiconductors.\n\n## 4. Competition\n\nTaiwan is a major producer of information products in the world. Driven by downstream industries, Taiwan ranks first in global shipments of power supplies. In recent years, due to the impact of the PC industry being hit by the rise of low-cost computers, tablets and smartphones, the competition from Chinese manufacturers at low prices, and the global economic downturn for several years, the prices of power supply products have been declining year by year, and the manufacturers' gross margins are not good as they used to be. However, with the increasing demand for energy-saving and carbon reduction in various countries, the conversion efficiency of power supply and power management function has become  the  focus  of  customer  requirements.  In  recent  years,  the  concept  of  smart  electricity consumption has attracted more attention from all countries. Energy saving and effective use of energy has become one of the key requirements of competing products from all countries. Smart meters are the first step to implement smart power grids. How to effectively capture the data that users need from meters has become an important issue. In addition, the application of data captured by meters is also of great importance, and many enterprises have begun to invest resources in research and development in this market. Under the development of industry standards and the successive formulation of product specifications, various lighting major manufacturers have launched a complete series of products. The threshold of R&D design, manufacturing capability and cost control has also been raised.\n\nFurthermore, large cloud service companies and data center operators, and new types of applications such as edge computing systems for 5G infrastructure, define hardware through software and introduce the concept of open hardware standards, which will not only continue to change the traditional data center  equipment,  but  will  also  impact  the  supply  pattern  and  demand  of  telecommunications equipment. They, together with Telecom providers and data centers, purchased a huge amount of servers, Networking and Telecom equipment and storage, and went beyond the traditional brand vendors and directly to Asia to seek customized products from ODM manufacturers according to specific requirements, which caused a certain impact on the supply chain of traditional commercial information equipment. As a key component of the power supply industry, it is necessary to readjust the product strategy and design production mode in the new supply chain pattern, and seize the opportunity to seek a new position.\n\nBesides, due to China's manpower shortage and the risk of the US-China trade war, in order to maintain lower manufacturing costs and improve price competitiveness, and quickly launch energy-saving products that meet the market demand, and reduce the risk of single manufacturing site, domestic SPS manufacturers have also set up factories in Thailand, Malaysia, India, the Philippines and other places, shortened the development cycle through internal design standardization, and improved the automation productivity of mid-end and low-end products. In the past few years, the global power supply industry has been moving towards integration through consolidation and the elimination of a number of small factories in the face of fierce market competition. However, there is still no single player to dominate",

Changes in Interest Rates\n\nCOVID-19 continued to plague the world in 2021, caused millions of deaths and devastated the global economy. The heavily hit U.S. and Europe maintained low interest rates and quantitative easing. However, given the increasing inflation and high vaccination coverage, the market generally expects the central banks in the U.S. and Taiwan will raise interest rates in 2022 to tackle inflation. The Company and its subsidiaries currently have a large amount of available bank credits. Even if the interest rates are adjusted upward, the impact on the Company's capital utilization should be limited.\n\n## 3. Changes in Exchange Rate\n\nThe exchange rate of Taiwan dollar against the US dollar at the end of 2021 was 27.69 dollars, an appreciation of 0.818 dollars (+2.87%) compared with that at the end of 2020, which was unfavorable to most of the products quoted in US dollars by the Company and its subsidiaries. In order to effectively manage the exchange rate risk, the Company and its subsidiaries try their best to quote in US dollars for purchase and payment, so as to achieve the effect of natural hedging. The Company  also has formulated the Operational procedures for Acquisition and Disposal of Assets, with the financial department referring to the analysis of well-known banks and research institutions at home and abroad, to  engage  in  forwarding  exchange,  exchange  rate  swaps  and  other  hedging  derivative  financial commodity trading, so as to reduce the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n## 4. Inflation\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) and the wholesale price index (WPI) in Taiwan increased by 1.96% and 9.4%, respectively, in 2021 from 2020. The Company and its subsidiaries raised selling prices accordingly and hence the profits and losses were not materially affected.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Certified Public Accountants Code of Professional Ethics in Republic of China (' the Code'), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matters we judged shall be presented in the auditors' report were as follows:\n\n## 1. Operating Revenue- Revenue Recognition of Vender Management Inventory (VMI)\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(p) revenue for operating revenue recognition (including VMI). Information regarding sales revenue and revenue from contracts with customers is shown in note (6)(u) of the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nThe Group has established vender managed inventories in overseas warehouses which do not belong to the Group. The revenue recognition, according to the partial sales contract of the Group, should be based on the circumstance of VMI client delivery. Both parties reconcile periodically to ensure the consistency in the amount and timing of sales recognition. Therefore, revenue recognition, VMI is one of the key judgmental areas for our audit.\n\n## Audit Procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedures included: understanding and testing the related controls surrounding the aforementioned sales and collection cycle, reconciling the account records between Acbel Polytech Inc. and VMI  client  delivery,  selectively  conducting  external  confirmations  on  VMI,  as  well  as  assessing  the operating  revenue  recognition  (including  VMI)  of  the  Group  to  determine  whether  related  accounting policies are applied appropriately.\n\n## 2. Inventory valuation\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(h) inventories and note (5) of the consolidated financial statements for inventories and accounting estimate of inventory valuation, respectively. Information regarding the inventory and related expenses is shown in note (6)(g) of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nDue to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, the price variability for the inventory of the Group is expected. Therefore, the test of inventory valuation is one of the significant evaluation in audit procedures.\n\n## Audit procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedure included: understanding and testing related controls of production cycle and assessing the allowance for loss due to price decline, obsolete, and slow moving inventories to determine whether policies of the Group and accounting policies are applied. In addition, in order to verify the rationality of assessment on allowance to reduce the price of inventory to the market price, we inspected the inventory aging statement, analyzed the change in aging inventory, as well as verified the aging inventory statement and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value\n\n## Other Matter\n\nAcbel Polytech Inc. has prepared its parent company only financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, on which we have issued an unmodified opinion.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and with the IFRSs, IASs, IFRC, SIC, endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic  of  China,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is  necessary  to  enable  the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the Group' s ability to continue as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cause significant doubt on the Group' s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6. Obtain  sufficient  and  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.",

(the 'Company') was incorporated in July 29, 1981 as a company limited by shares and registered under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, (R.O.C.). The major business activities of the Company are the research and development, manufacture, and sale of power supplies. The Company's common shares were listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE).\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'Group' and individually as the 'Group entities'). Please refer to note (4)(c) for related information about the Group primarily business activities.\n\n## (2) Approval date and procedures of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on March 11, 2022.\n\n## (3) New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted:\n\n- (a) The impact of the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') endorsed by the Financial Supervisory Commission, R.O.C. ('FSC') which have already been adopted.\n\nThe Group has initially adopted the following new amendments, which do not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements, from January 1, 2021:\n\n- \u25cf Amendments to IFRS 4 'Extension of the Temporary Exemption from Applying IFRS 9'\n- \u25cf Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS39, IFRS7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 'Interest Rate Benchmark ReformPhase 2'\n- \u25cf Amendments to IFRS 16 'Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond June 30, 2021'\n- (b) The impact of IFRS issued by the FSC but not yet effective\n\nThe Group assesses that the adoption of the following new amendments, effective for annual period beginning on January 1, 2022, would not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements:\n\n- \u25cf Amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use'\n- \u25cf Amendments to IAS 37 'Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract'\n- \u25cf Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\n- \u25cf Amendments to IFRS 3 'Reference to the Conceptual Framework'",

The consolidated financial statements are presented in New Taiwan Dollar, which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented in New Taiwan Dollar has been rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\n## (c) Basis of consolidation\n\n- (i) Principle of preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and subsidiaries. Subsidiaries re entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its control over the entity.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  the  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Group attributes the profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nThe Group prepares consolidated financial statements using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.\n\nChanges in the Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Any differences between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received will be recognized directly in equity, and the Group will attribute it to the owners of the parent.",

Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost, with the resulting gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss. The Group recognizes as gain or loss in profit or loss the difference between (i) the fair value of the consideration received as well as any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost; and (ii) the assets (including any goodwill), liabilities of the subsidiary as well as any related non-controlling interests at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost, as gain or loss in profit or loss.

Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty,  result  in  its  settlement  by  the  issue  of  equity  instruments  do  not  affect  its classification.\n\n## (f) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Time deposits which meet the above definition and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes are reclassified as cash equivalents.\n\n## (g) Financial instruments\n\nAccount receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is an account receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. An account receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date basis.\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\n\n## 1) Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\n- A  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  if  it  meets  both  of  the  following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is the amount at which the  financial  asset  is  measured  at  initial  recognition,  plus/minus,  the  cumulative amortization using the effective interest method, adjusted for any loss allowance. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses, as well as impairment, are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.",

However,  they  are  included  in  the  account receivables line items.\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nDebt investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nEquity investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the exdividend date.\n\n## 3) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nAll financial assets not classified as amortized cost or FVOCI described as above are measured at FVTPL, including derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset, which meets the requirements to be measured  at  amortized  cost  or  at  FVOCI,  as  at  FVTPL  if  doing  so  eliminates  or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value.

Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at  FVOCI  are  credit-impaired.  A  financial asset is ' creditimpaired'  when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial assets is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;\n- \u00b7 the lender of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n\n\u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognized in other comprehensive income instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For corporate customers, the Group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery.  The  Group  expects  no  significant  recovery  from  the  amount  written  off. However,  financial  assets  that  are  written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\n## 5) Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of balance sheet, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets.

Equity instruments issued are recognized as the amount of consideration received, less the direct cost of issuing.\n\n## 3) Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it  is  designated  as  such  on  initial  recognition.  Financial  liabilities  at  FVTPL  are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as either fair value hedges.\n\nAt inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group also documents the economic relationship  between  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument,  including  whether  the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\nThe fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss except when the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument designated at FVOCI in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe carrying amount of a hedged item not already measured at fair value is adjusted for the fair value change attributable to the hedged risk with a corresponding entry in profit or loss. For debt instruments measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not adjusted as it is already at fair value,  but  the  hedging  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  instead  of  other comprehensive income. When the hedged item is an equity instrument designated at FVOCI, the hedging gain or loss remains in other comprehensive income to match that of the hedging instrument. Where hedging gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss, they are recognized in the same line as the hedged item.\n\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold,  expires  is  terminated  or  is  exercised,  then  hedge  accounting  is  discontinued prospectively. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## (h) Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The cost of inventories is based on weighted-average costing principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.",

Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Thereafter, generally, the assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to assets not within the scope of IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets. Such assets will continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Impairment losses on assets initially classified as held for sale and any subsequent  gains  or  losses  on  remeasurement  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss.  Gains  are  not recognized in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been recognized.\n\nWhen the Company is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, which shall classify all the assets and liabilities as held for sale when the criteria set out in the aforementioned are met, regardless of whether the Company will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nOnce classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are no longer amortized or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity accounted.\n\n## (j) Investment in associates\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized initially at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The carrying amount of the investment in associates includes goodwill arising from the acquisition, less, any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Group' s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of those associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group from the date on which significant influence commences until the date on which significant influence ceases. The Group recognizes any changes of its proportionate share in the investee within capital surplus, when an associate's equity changes due to reasons other than profit and loss or comprehensive income, which did not result in changes in actual proportionate share.\n\nGain and loss resulting from the transactions between the Group and an associate are recognized only to the extent of unrealized Group's interest in the associate.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interests in an associate, it discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. After the recognized interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.",

In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be reliably determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- 1) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- 2) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n- 3) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and\n- 4) payments for purchase or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nFor sale-and-leaseback transactions, the Group applies the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of the asset. If the transfer of an asset satisfies the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Group measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Accordingly, the Group recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. If the transfer of an asset does not satisfy the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Group will continue to recognize the transferred asset and shall recognize the financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds.\n\n## (ii) As a lessor\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance  lease  or  an  operating  lease.  To  classify  each  lease,  the  Group  makes  an  overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset.

The unwinding of the discount is recognized as finance cost.\n\nA provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, based on historical  warranty  data  and  a  weighting  of  all  possible  outcomes  against  their  associated probabilities.\n\nA provision for the site restoration is measured at a restoration cost which was estimated using different assumptions on the related changes in cost-elements from current market price.\n\nThe  Group follows the policy of Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, accruing the module recycle fee based on the size of the power station, and recognize as provision by the present value of decommissioning costs.\n\n## (p) Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. The Group recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or a service to a customer. The accounting policies for the Group's main types of revenue are explained below.\n\n## (i) Sale of goods\n\nThe  Group  manufactures  electronic  components  to  electronic  manufacturers.  The  Group recognizes revenue when control of the products has been transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe  Group  often  offers  volume  discounts  to  its  customers  based  on  aggregate  sales  of electronic components. Revenue from these sales is recognized based on the price specified in the  contract,  net  of  the  estimated  volume  discounts.  Accumulated  experience  is  used  to estimate the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales of electronic  components  are  made  with  a  credit  term, which is consistent with the market practice.\n\n## (ii) Electricity generating income\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity  is  recognized  after  the  electricity  transmission  is completed through the grid, and the revenue is calculated according to the fee agreed with Taiwan Power Company.\n\n## (iii) Rendering of service\n\nThe Group provides project management advisory and maintenance services. Revenue from providing services is recognized in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. For fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. The proportion of services provided is determined based on the services incurred to date as a proportion of the total services of the transaction. In case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered by the Group exceed the payment, a contract asset is recognized. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognized.\n\n## (iv) Financing components\n\nThe Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\n## (q) Government grants and government assistance\n\nThe Group recognizes an unconditional government grant as other income when the grant becomes receivable. Other government grants related to assets are initially recognized as deferred income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant; they are then recognized in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses or losses incurred are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses or losses are recognized.",

When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the total of the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present  value  of  the  economic  benefits,  consideration  is  given  to  any  minimum  funding requirements.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any, excluding  interest),  are  recognized  immediately  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and accumulated in retained earnings within equity. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\n## (iii) Other long-term employee benefits\n\nThe Group provides the loans with favorable terms to employees and presented in other noncurrent assets.\n\n## (iv) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.",

The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.\n\nFor share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the sharebased  payment  is  measured  to  reflect  such  conditions, and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.\n\n## (t) Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes comprise current taxes and deferred taxes. Except for expenses related to business combinations  or  recognized  directly  in  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income,  all  current  and deferred taxes shall be recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatment, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under IAS37.\n\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payables or receivables on the taxable profits (losses) for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payables or receivables are the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred taxes arise due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  their  respective  tax  bases.  Deferred  taxes  are recognized except for the following:\n\n- (i) temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits (losses) at the time of the transaction;\n- (ii) temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- (iii) taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred taxes are measured at tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reserve, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.",

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n\n## (u) Earnings per share\n\nThe Group discloses the basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company. The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding  after  adjustment  for  the  effects  of  all  dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares.  Dilutive potential  ordinary  shares  comprise  employee  stock  options,  remuneration  to  employees  not  yet approved by the directors, restricted employee shares, and convertible bonds.\n\n## (v) Operating segments\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may incur revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the Group). Operating results of the operating segment are regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. Each operating segment consists of standalone financial information.\n\n## (5) Significant accounting assumptions and judgments, and major sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses.

Due to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, which tends to devalue the inventories, the Group evaluates the costs of inventories using the net realizable value. Inventory valuation is based on the demand of the products during the specific period, therefore, the value of inventories may be variable due to the nature of fast-paced industry.

Of the remaining balance, 10% is to be appropriated as legal reserve. Only if the legal reserves have attained to the paid-in capital could be the exception, besides, special reserves are supposed to set  aside  or  reversed  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  regulations  or  as  required  by  the government. And then any remaining profit together with any undistributed retained earnings shall be distributed according to the distribution plan proposed by the Board of Directors and submitted to the stockholders' meeting for approval.\n\nThe Company explicitly stipulate in its articles of incorporation to authorize the distributable dividends and bonuses, in whole or in part, which may be paid in cash after a resolution has been adopted by a majority vote at a meeting of the Board of Directors attended by two-thirds of the total number of directors; and in addition thereto, a report of such distribution shall be submitted to the shareholders' meeting.\n\nThe  Company' s  industry  is  currently  in  a  gentle  growth  phase.    To  take  the  capital requirements of the Company and the shareholders into account, the Company's remaining balance is partially distributed as cash dividends to stockholders, and the amount of cash dividends should not be lower than 50% of the total dividends.\n\n## 1) Legal reserve\n\nIf the Company experienced profit for the year, the distribution of the statutory earnings reserve, either by new shares or by cash, shall be decided at the shareholders meeting, and the distribution amount is limited to the portion of legal reserve which exceeds 25 percent of the paid-in capital.\n\n## 2) Special reserve\n\nIn accordance with Ruling No. 1010012865 issued by the FSC on April 6, 2012, a portion  of  current-period  earnings  and  undistributed  prior-period  earnings  shall  be reclassified as a special earnings reserve during earnings distribution. The amount to be reclassified should equal to the current-period total net reduction of other shareholders' equity. Similarly, a portion of undistributed prior period earnings shall be reclassified as a special earnings reserve (and is not qualified for earnings distribution) to account for cumulative changes to other shareholders' equity pertaining to prior periods. Amounts of subsequent reversals pertaining to the net reduction of other shareholders' equity shall qualify for additional distributions. The Company did not set aside a special reserve for the ruling.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (v) Remuneration to employees and directors\n\nAccording to the Articles of Incorporation, the Company should contribute no less than 2% of the profit as employee remuneration and less than 2% as directors' remuneration when there is profit for the year. However, if the Company has accumulated deficits, the profit should be reserved to offset the deficit.\n\nThe aforementioned profit for the year is the earnings before tax, excluding directors' remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration to employees may be distributed in stocks or in cash and may be distributed to such targets including the employees of the Company' s subordinate companies who meet certain requirements.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  Company  estimated  its  employee remuneration  amounting  at  $37,682  and  $60,929,  respectively,  and  directors'  remuneration amounting  at  $7,246  and  $15,820,  respectively.  The  estimated  amounts  mentioned  above  are calculated based on the net profit before tax, excluding the remuneration to employees and directors of each period, multiplied by the percentage of remuneration of employees and directors as specified in the Company's Articles. These remunerations were expensed under operating costs or operating expenses. If remuneration to employees is resolved to be distributed in stock, the number of shares is calculated based on the closing price of the Company's shares, one day before the date of the Board of Directors meeting.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the remunerations to employees amounted to $60,929  and  $44,549,  and  to  directors  amounted  to  $15,820  and  $17,345,  respectively.  The aforementioned estimated amounts are identical to those of the actual distributions. The related information is available on the Market Observation Post System website.\n\n## (w) Interest income\n\nThe details of interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n|                                    | 2021     | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| Interest income from bank deposits | $ 30,184 | 61,340 |\n| Others                             | 23       | 31     |\n|                                    | $ 30,207 | 61,371 |\n\n## (x) Other income and losses\n\n|                                                                             | 2021      | 2020      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gains (losses) on disposal of land use right, property, plant and equipment | $ 181     | 1,646,525 |\n| Litigation settlement Income                                                | -         | 304,173   |\n| Insurance compensation (note (10))                                          | 344,804   | 62,853    |\n| Gains on disposal of investments (note (6)(j))                              | 105,145   | -         |\n| Impairment loss                                                             | -         | (65,291)  |\n| Others                                                                      | 5,445     | 18,008    |\n|                                                                             | $ 455,575 | 1,966,268 |\n\n(Continued)",

The gain on disposal was $1,649,616. The above amount deducted related costs, local corporate income tax, and estimated tax of repatriation of profits was $1,006,383. Please refer to note (6)(h).\n- (ii) The  Company  took  legal  actions  against  Fairchild  Semiconductor  International  Inc. (Fairchild),  requesting  for  compensation  due  to  some  defects  on  the  product  ' voltage regulator' , which was designed and manufactured by Fairchild. On August 6, 2020, the Company received the compensation amounting to USD12,000 thousand. After deducting the related expenses with this case, the net amount was recognized as other income.\n- (iii) The Company recognized $65,291 of impairment losses due to the carrying amount of other non-current assets exceeds its recoverable amount which was determined by the net fair value.\n\n## (y) Financial Instruments\n\n## (i) Credit risk\n\n- 1) Exposure to credit risk\n\nThe carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum amount exposed to credit risk.\n\n## 2) Concentration to credit risk\n\nThe customers of the Group are mainly high-tech companies and there is no significant concentrated trade between a specific client. Moreover, the sales territories are dispersed. Therefore, the credit risk of accounts receivables is not significantly concentrated. The Group regularly evaluates the financial condition of these clients to reduce the credit risk of  accounts  receivables.  However,  the  clients  generally  are  not  required  to  provide collaterals.\n\n## 3) Receivables and debt securities\n\nFor credit risk exposure of note and accounts receivables, please refer to note 6(f).\n\nOther financial assets at amortized cost include cash and cash equivalents, time deposit, and current and non-current other receivables, are considered to have low credit risk, and thus, the impairment provision recognized during the period was limited to 12 months expected credit losses.",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (ii) Structure of risk management\n\nThe Group's finance department provide business services for the overall internal department. It sets the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk arising from both the domestic and international financial market operations. The Group minimizes the risk exposure through derivative financial instruments. The Board of Directors  regulated  the  use  of  derivative  and  non-derivative  financial  instruments  in accordance with the Group' s policy about risks arising from financial instruments such as currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and the investments of excess liquidity. The audit committee and internal auditors of the Group continue with the review of the amount of the risk exposure in accordance with the Group' s policy and the risk management policies and procedures.  The Group has no transactions  in  financial  instruments  (including  derivative  financial  instruments)  for  the purpose of speculation.  The finance department reports to the Board of Directors and the audit committee periodically.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group' s receivables from customers and investment securities.\n\n## 1) Accounting receivable and other receivables\n\nThe Group's finance department has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's credit limits are  offered.  Credit  limits  are  established  for  each  customer,  which  represent  the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the finance department, and are reviewed periodically. Customers that fail to meet the Group's benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.\n\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk.  The Group's customers are mainly from the high-tech industry. In order to mitigate account receivable credit risk, the Group constantly assesses the financial status of the customers, and requests the customers to provide guarantee or security if necessary. The Group regularly accesses the collectability of accounts receivable and recognizes allowance for accounts receivable. The impairment losses are always within management's expectation.\n\nIn  monitoring  customer  credit  risk,  customers  are  grouped  according  to  their  credit characteristics,  including  customer  profile,  operating  and  financial  status,  payment records and the degree of cooperation. Customers that are graded as ' high risk'  are placed on a restricted customer list and monitored by the finance department more strictly, and the transactions are made on a more cautious way.",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Group set the allowance for bad debt account to reflect the estimated losses for trade and other receivables. The allowance for bad debt account consists of specific losses relating to individually significant exposure and the unrecognized losses arising from similar  assets  groups.  The  allowance  for  bad  debt  account  is  based  on  historical collection record of similar financial assets.\n\n## 2) Investments\n\nThe  credit  risk  exposure  in  the  bank  deposits,  fixed  income  investments  and  other financial instruments are measured and monitored by the Group's finance department. Since the Group's transaction counterparties and contractually obligated counterparties are banks, financial institutes and corporate organizations with good credits, there are no compliance issues, and therefore no significant credit risk.  The finance department evaluates the counterparty's credit condition when investing in bond investment without an active market, and do not expect to have any significant credit risk.\n\n## 3) Guarantees\n\nPlease refer to note (13)(a) for the financial guarantees as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## (iv) Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group manages sufficient cash and cash equivalents so as to cope with its operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Group' s management supervises the banking facilities and ensures in compliance with the terms of the loan agreements.\n\nThe loans and borrowings from the bank and issued corporate bonds form an important source of liquidity for the Group. Please refer to note (6)(m) and note (6)(o) for unused short-term and long-term credit lines as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## (v) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n\nThe Group buys and sells derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market  risks.  Generally  the  Group  seeks  to  apply  hedge  accounting  in  order  to  manage volatility in profit or loss.\n\n## 1) Currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group's entities, primarily the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) and US Dollars (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY).  The currencies used in these transactions are denominated in NTD, USD, and CNY.",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nAt any point in time, the Group hedges specific percentage of its estimated foreign currency exposure with respect to its forecast sales and purchases over the following six months. The Group also hedges trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.  The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.\n\nThe Group designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. Most of these contracts have a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. The forward elements of forward exchange contracts are excluded from designation as the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. The Group's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash  flows.  The  Group  assesses  whether  the  derivative  designated  in  each  hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\n## 2) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group borrows funds on fixed and variable interest rates, which has a risk exposure to changes in fair value and cash flow. Therefore, the Group manages the interest rates risk by maintaining an adequate combination of fixed and variable interest rates.\n\n## 3) Other price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to equity price risk arising from investments in foreign listed equity securities.\n\n## (aa) Capital management\n\nThe Group maintains the capital based on the current operating characteristics of the industry, future development,  and  changes  in  external  environment,  to  assure  there  is  financial  resource  and operating plan to support working capital, capital expenditures, research & development expense, debt redemption and dividend payment and so on. The management decides the optimized capital by using appropriate debt-to-equity ratio, interest-bearing liabilities-to-equity ratio or other financial ratios. To maintain a strong capital base, the Group enhances the return on equity by optimizing debt-to-equity ratio. The Group's debt-to-equity ratio at the end of the reporting date was as follows:\n\n|                                              | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Total liabilities                            | $ 20,177,062        | 16,332,304          |\n| Total equity                                 | 10,501,452          | 10,643,594          |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities                 | 8,820,685           | 6,701,323           |\n| Debt-to-equity ratio                         | % 192               | % 153               |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities to equity ratio | % 84                | % 63                |\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Group did not change the capital management.",

('the Company'), which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Certification of Financial Statements by Certified Public Accountants, and the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Certified Public Accountants Code of Professional Ethics in Republic of China ('the Code'), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matters we judged shall be presented in the auditors' report were as follows:\n\n## 1. Operating Revenue- Revenue Recognition of Vender Management Inventory (VMI)\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(o) revenue for operating revenue recognition (including VMI). Information regarding sales revenue and revenue from contracts with customers is shown in note (6)(s) of the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nThe Company has established vender managed inventories in overseas warehouses which do not belong to the Company. The revenue recognition, according to the partial sales contract of the Company, should be based  on  the  circumstance  of  VMI  client  delivery.  Both  parties  reconcile  periodically  to  ensure  the consistency in the amount and timing of sales recognition. Therefore, revenue recognition, VMI is one of the key judgmental areas for our audit.\n\n## Audit Procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedures included: understanding and testing the related controls surrounding the aforementioned sales and collection cycle, reconciling the account records between Acbel Polytech Inc. and VMI client delivery, selectively conducting external confirmations on VMI and assessing the operating revenue recognition (including VMI) of the Company to determine whether related accounting policies are applied appropriately.\n\n## 2. Inventory valuation\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(g) inventories and note (5) of the financial statements for inventories and accounting estimate of inventory valuation, respectively. Information regarding the inventory and related expenses is shown in note (6)(f) of the financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nDue to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, the price variability for the inventory of the Company is expected. Therefore, the test of inventory valuation is one of the significant evaluations in audit procedures.\n\n## Audit procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedure included: understanding and testing related controls of production cycle and assessing the allowance for loss due to price decline, obsolete, and slow-moving inventories to determine whether policies of the Company and accounting policies are applied. In addition, in order to verify the rationality of assessment on allowance to reduce the price of inventory to the market price, we inspected the inventory aging statement, analyzed the change in aging inventory, as well as verified the aging inventory statement and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the Company' s ability to continue as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either intends to liquidate the Company  or  to  cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6. Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the investment in other entities accounted for using the equity method to express an opinion on this financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.",

We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about  the  matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should  not  be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partners on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report are I-Wen Wang and HsingFu Yen.\n\n## KPMG\n\nTaipei, Taiwan (Republic of China) March 11, 2022\n\n## Notes to Readers\n\nThe accompanying  financial statements are intended only to present the  financial position, financial performance and cash flows in accordance with the accounting principles and practices generally accepted in the Republic of China and not those of any other jurisdictions. The standards, procedures and practices to audit such  financial statements are those generally accepted and applied in the Republic of China.\n\nThe independent auditors' audit report and the accompanying  financial statements are the English translation of the Chinese version prepared and used in the Republic of China.

At the end of each subsequent reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies using the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated into the functional currencies using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.

Time deposits which meet the above definition and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes should be recognized as cash equivalents.\n\n## (f) Financial instruments\n\nAccount receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is an account receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. An account receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date basis.\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL.

However, they are included in the trade receivables' line item.\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment' s fair value in other  comprehensive  income.  This  election  is  made  on  an  instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nDebt investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nEquity investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the date on which the Company's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the ex-dividend date.\n\n## 3) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nAll financial assets not classified as amortized cost or FVOCI described as above are measured at FVTPL, including derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset, which meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value.

This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Company' s historical experience and informed credit assessment as well as forwardlooking information.\n\nThe Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is  equivalent  to  the  globally  understood  definition  of  ' investment  grade  which  is considered to be BBB- or higher per  Standard & Poor's, Baa3 or higher per Moody's, twA or higher per Taiwan Ratings'.\n\nThe Company assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.\n\nThe Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the financial asset is more than 90 days past due or the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full.\n\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\n12 month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).\n\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk.",

Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the  Company in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\nAt  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  assesses  whether  financial  assets  carried  at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ' credit-impaired' when  one  or  more  events  that  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;\n- \u00b7 the  lender  of  the  borrower,  for  economic  or  contractual  reasons  relating  to  the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n- \u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognized in other comprehensive income instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For corporate customers, the Company individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However,  financial  assets  that  are  written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Company's procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\n## 5) Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe  Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash  flows  in  a  transaction  in  which  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of ownership  of  the  financial  asset  are  transferred  or  in  which  the  Company  neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nThe Company enters transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of balance sheet but retains either all or substantially all the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized.",

Equity instruments issued are recognized as the amount of consideration received, less the direct cost of issuing.\n\n## 3) Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative, or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 4) Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe  Company derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or have expired. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 5) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of balance sheet when, and only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.",

Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as fair value hedges.\n\nAt  inception  of  designated  hedging  relationships,  the  Company  documents  the  risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Company also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\nThe fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss except when the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument designated at FVOCI in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe carrying amount of a hedged item not already measured at fair value is adjusted for the fair value change attributable to the hedged risk with a corresponding entry in profit or loss. For debt instruments measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not adjusted as it is already at fair value,  but  the  hedging  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  instead  of  other comprehensive income. When the hedged item is an equity instrument designated at FVOCI, the hedging gain or loss remains in other comprehensive income to match that of the hedging instrument. Where hedging gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss, they are recognized in the same line as the hedged item.\n\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold,  expires,  is  terminated  or  is  exercised,  then  hedge  accounting  is  discontinued prospectively. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## (g) Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The cost of inventories is calculated using the weight-average method, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.",

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized initially at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The carrying amount of the investment in associates includes goodwill arising from the acquisition, less, any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe financial statements include the Company's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of those associates after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Company  from  the  date  on  which  significant  influence  commences  until  the  date  on  which significant influence ceases.\n\nThe  Company recognizes any changes of its proportionate share in the investee within capital surplus,  when  an  associate' s  equity  changes  due  to  reasons  other  than  profit  and  loss  or comprehensive income, which did not result in changes in actual significant influence.\n\nGains and losses resulting from transactions between the Company and an associate are recognized only to the extent of unrelated Company's interests in the associate.\n\nWhen the Company's share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interests in an associate, it discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. After the recognized interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\n## (i) Investment in subsidiaries\n\nWhen preparing the parent-company-only financial statements, investment in subsidiaries which are controlled by the Company is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the net income, other comprehensive income and equity attributable to shareholders of the Company in the  parent-company-only  financial  statement,  are  equal  to  those  in  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nChanges in the Company's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\n## (j) Property, plant and equipment\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nItems  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost,  which  includes  capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\n\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in profit or loss.",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## (i) As a lessee\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be reliably determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate.

It is remeasured when:\n\n- 1) there is a change in future lease payments arising from the change in an index or rate; or\n- 2) there is a change in the Company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or\n- 3) there is a change in the lease term resulting from a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, or\n- 4) there is a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option; or\n- 5) there are any lease modifications\n\nWhen  the  lease  liability  is  remeasured,  other  than  lease  modifications,  a  corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or in profit and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease for lease  modifications  that  decrease  the  scope  of  the  lease,  the  Company  accounts  for  the remeasurement of the lease liability by decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease, and recognize in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of the lease.\n\nThe Company presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment and lease liabilities as a separate line item respectively in the statement of financial position.\n\nThe Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for shortterm leases of office space and IT equipment that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value asset. The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC.\n\n## Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\nFor sale-and-leaseback transactions, the Company applies the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of the asset. If the transfer of an asset satisfies the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Company measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Accordingly, the Company recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. If the transfer of an asset does not satisfy the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Company will continue to recognize the transferred asset and shall recognize the financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds.\n\n## (ii) As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Company makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then the lease is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Company considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\n## (l) Intangible assets\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Company intends to, and has sufficient resources to, complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to  initial  recognition,  development  expenditure  is  measured  at  cost,  less  accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nOther intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## (ii) Subsequent expenditure\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.",

The estimated useful lives of computer software for current and comparative periods are 3~5 years.\n\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each annual reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\n\n## (m) Impairment - non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\n## (n) Provisions\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognized as finance cost.\n\nA provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, based on historical  warranty  data  and  a  weighting  of  all  possible  outcomes  against  their  associated probabilities.",

The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or a service to a customer. The accounting policies for the Company's main types of revenue are explained below.\n\n## (i) Sale of goods\n\nThe Company manufactures and sells electronic components to electronic manufacturers. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Company has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\n\nThe  Company often offers volume discounts to its customers based on aggregate sales of electronic components. Revenue from these sales is recognized based on the price specified in the  contract,  net  of  the  estimated  volume  discounts.  Accumulated  experience  is  used  to estimate the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales of electronic  components  are  made  with  a  credit  term, which is consistent with the market practice.\n\n## (ii) Electricity generating income\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity  is  recognized  after  the  electricity  transmission  is completed through the grid, and the revenue is calculated according to the fee agreed with Taiwan Power Company.\n\n## (iii) Rendering of service\n\nThe Company provides project management advisory and maintenance services. Revenue from providing services is recognized in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. For fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. The proportion of services provided is determined based on the services incurred to date as a proportion of the total services of the transaction. In case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered by the Company exceed the payment, a contract asset is recognized. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognized.",

Consequently, the Company does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\n## (p) Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined contribution plans\n\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided.\n\n## (ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each the plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.\n\nThe calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any, excluding  interest),  are  recognized  immediately  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and accumulated in retained earnings within equity. The Company determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The Company recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\n## (iii) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized  for  the  amount  expected  to  be  paid  if  the  Company  has  a  present  legal  or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.",

The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards which related service  and  non-market  performance  conditions  are  expected  to  be  met,  such  that  the  amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.\n\nFor share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the sharebased  payment  is  measured  to  reflect  such  conditions, and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.\n\n## (r) Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes comprise current taxes and deferred taxes. Except for expenses related to business combinations  or  recognized  directly  in  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income,  all  current  and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatment, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under IAS37.\n\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payables or receivables on the taxable profits (losses) for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payables or receivables are the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred taxes arise due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  their  respective  tax  bases.  Deferred  taxes  are recognized except for the following:\n\n- (i) temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits (losses) at the time of the transaction;\n- (ii) temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- (iii) taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred taxes are measured at tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reserve, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the following criteria are met:\n\n- (i) the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and against current tax liabilities; and",

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n\n## (s) Earnings per share\n\nThe  Company discloses the basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to ordinary equity holders  of  the  Company.  The  calculation  of  basic  earnings  per  share  is  based  on  the  profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Dilutive potential ordinary shares comprise employee stock options, remuneration to employees not yet approved by the directors, restricted employee shares and convertible bonds.\n\n## (t) Operating segments\n\nThe Company discloses the operating segments information in the consolidated financial statements. Therefore,  the  Company  does  not  disclose  the  operating  segments  information  in  the  parentcompany-only financial statements.\n\n## (5) Significant accounting assumptions and judgments, and major sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ these estimates.\n\nThe  management  continues  to  monitor  the  accounting  estimates  and  assumptions.  The  management recognizes any changes in accounting estimates during the period and the impact of those changes in accounting estimates in the next period.\n\nThere are no critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements.",

Due to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, which tends to devalue the inventories, the Company evaluates the costs of inventories using the net realizable value. Inventory valuation is based on the demand of the products during the specific period; therefore, the value of inventories may be variable due to the nature of fast-paced industry.

Of the remaining balance, 10% is to be appropriated as legal reserve. Only if the legal reserve attaining to the paid-in capital could be the exception, besides, special reserves are supposed to set aside or reversed in accordance with the relevant regulations or as required by the government. And then any remaining profit together with any undistributed retained earnings shall be distributed according to the distribution plan proposed by the Board of Directors and submitted to the stockholders' meeting for approval.\n\nThe Company explicitly stipulate in its Articles of Incorporation to authorize the distributable dividends and bonuses, in whole or in part, which may be paid in cash after a resolution has been adopted by a majority vote at a meeting of the Board of Directors attended by two thirds of the total number of directors; and in addition thereto, a report of such distribution shall be submitted to the shareholders' meeting.\n\nThe Company's industry is currently in a gentle growth phase. To take the capital requirements of the Company and the shareholders into account, the Company' s remaining balance is partially distributed as cash dividends to stockholders, and the amount of cash dividends should not be lower than 50% of the total dividends.\n\n## 1) Legal reserve\n\nIf the Company experienced profit for the year, the distribution of the statutory earnings reserve, either by new shares or by cash, shall be decided at the shareholders meeting, and the distribution amount is limited to the portion of legal reserve which exceeds 25 percent of the paid-in capital.\n\n## 2) Special reserve\n\nIn accordance with Ruling No. 1010012865 issued by the FSC on April 6, 2012, a portion  of  current-period  earnings  and  undistributed  prior-period  earnings  shall  be reclassified as a special earnings reserve during earnings distribution. The amount to be reclassified should equal to the current-period total net reduction of other shareholders' equity. Similarly, a portion of undistributed prior period earnings shall be reclassified as a special earnings reserve (and is not qualified for earnings distribution) to account for cumulative changes to other shareholders' equity pertaining to prior periods. Amounts of subsequent reversals pertaining to the net reduction of other shareholders' equity shall qualify for additional distributions. The Company did not set aside a special reserve for the Ruling.",

For the year 2019 earnings distribution in 2020, the amount to be reclassified to special reserve shall be a portion of current-period earnings and undistributed prior-period earnings. As for the year 2020 earnings distribution in 2021, the amount to be reclassified to special reserve shall be a portion  of  current-period  earnings  plus  other  line  items  in  the  retained  earnings movements and undistributed prior-period  earning.

However, if the Company has accumulated deficits, the profit should be reserved to offset the deficit.\n\nThe aforementioned profit for the year is the earnings before tax, excluding directors' remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration to employees may be distributed in stocks or in cash and may be distributed to such targets including the employees of the Company' s subordinate companies who meet certain requirements.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  Company  estimated  its  employee remuneration  amounting  to  $37,682  and  $60,929,  respectively,  and  directors'  remuneration amounting to $7,246 and $15,820, respectively. The estimated amounts mentioned above were calculated based on the net profit before tax, excluding the remuneration to employees, directors of each period, multiplied by the percentage of remuneration to employees, directors as specified in the Company's  articles.  These  remunerations  were  expensed  under  operating  costs  or  operating expenses. If remuneration to employees is resolved to be distributed in stock, the number of shares is calculated based on the closing price of the Company's shares, one day before the date of the Board of Directors' meeting. There is no difference between the amount approved in the meeting of the Board of Directors and those recognized in the financial statements in 2021 and 2020.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the remunerations to employees amounted to $60,929 and $44,549, respectively, and to directors amounted to $15,820 and $17,345, respectively. The aforemationed estimated amounts are identical to those of the actual distributions. The related information is available on the Market Observation Post System Website.",

Moreover, the sales territories are  dispersed.  Therefore,  the  credit  risk  of  accounts  receivables  is  not  significantly concentrated. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of these clients to reduce the credit risk of accounts receivables. However, the clients generally are not required to provide collaterals.",

A weakening (strengthening) 5% of each major foreign currency against Company entities'  functional currency as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 would have affected the net profit before tax as followings:\n\n|                       | 2021        | 2020      |\n|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| USD (against the TWD) |             |           |\n| Strengthening 5%      | $ (331,415) | (276,155) |\n| Weakening 5%          | 331,415     | 276,155   |\n\nSince the Company has many kinds of functional currency, the information on foreign exchange gain (loss) on monetary items is disclosed by total amount.  For the years  2021 and  2020,  foreign  exchange  gain  (loss)  (including  realized  and  unrealized  portions) amounted to $155,787 and $204,107, respectively.\n\n## (iv) Interest rate analysis\n\nThe details of financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk were as follows:\n\n|                            | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                            | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2020 |\n| Fixed rate instruments:    |                   |                   |\n| Financial assets           | $ -               | -                 |\n| Financial liabilities      | $ 4,727,744       | 4,674,992         |\n| Variable rate instruments: |                   |                   |\n| Financial assets           | $ 304,154         | 302,615           |\n| Financial liabilities      | $ 1,420,250       | 486,380           |\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis is based on the exposure to the interest rate risk of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments on the reporting date.  Regarding the liabilities with variable interest rates, the analysis is on the basis of the assumption that the amount of liabilities outstanding at the reporting date was outstanding throughout the year. The rate of change is expressed as the interest rate increases or decreases by 0.25% when reporting to management internally, which also represents management of the Company's assessment on the reasonably possible interval of interest rate change.",

However, if no quoted prices are available, the discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair values.\n\n## 3) Valuation technique for financial instruments measured at fair value\n\n## a) Non-derivative financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments trade in active markets are based on quoted market prices. The quoted price of a financial instrument obtained from main exchanges and onthe-run bonds from Taipei Exchange can be used as a basis to determine the fair value of the listed companies' equity instrument and debt instrument of the quoted price in an active market.\n\nMeasurements of fair value of financial instruments without an active market are based on valuation technique.\n\n## b) Derivative financial instruments\n\nMeasurement of fair value of derivative instruments is based on the valuation techniques that are generally accepted by the market participants. For instance, discount method or option pricing models. Fair value of forward currency exchange is usually determined by using the forward currency rate.\n\n- 4) There were no transfers among fair value hierarchies for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 5) Reconciliation of Level 3 fair values\n\n|                                    | Fair value through profit or loss Investment of limited partnership   | Fair value through other comprehensive income Unquoted equity instruments   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Opening balance, January 1, 2021   | $ -                                                                   | 548,955                                                                     |\n| Total gains and losses recognized: |                                                                       |                                                                             |\n| In profit or loss                  | 1,479                                                                 | -                                                                           |\n| In other comprehensive income      | -                                                                     | (11,074)                                                                    |\n| Purchased                          | 122,180                                                               | -                                                                           |\n| Ending balance, December 31, 2021  | $ 123,659                                                             | 537,881                                                                     |",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC.\n\n## Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\n## (ii) Structure of risk management\n\nThe  Company' s  finance  department  provide  business  services  for  the  overall  internal department. It sets the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk arising from both the domestic and international financial market operations.  The  Company  minimizes  the  risk  exposure  through  derivative  financial instruments.  The  Board  of  Directors  regulated  the  use  of  derivative  and  non-derivative financial  instruments  in  accordance  with  the  Company' s  policy  about  risks  arising  from financial instruments such as currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and the investments of excess liquidity. The audit committee and internal auditors of the Company continue with the review of the amount of the risk exposure in accordance with the Company's policy and the risk management policies and procedures.  The Company has no transactions in financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments) for the purpose of speculation.  The finance department reports to the board of directors and the audit committee periodically.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities.\n\n## 1) Accounting receivable and other receivables\n\nThe Company's finance department has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Company's credit limits are  offered.  Credit  limits  are  established  for  each  customer,  which  represent  the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the finance department, and are reviewed  periodically.  Customers  that  fail  to  meet  the  Company's  benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Company only on a prepayment basis.\n\nThe  Company' s  exposure  to  credit  risk  is  influenced  mainly  by  the  individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Company's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk. The Company' s customers are mainly from the high-tech industry.  In order to mitigate account receivable credit risk, the Company constantly assesses the financial status of the customers, and requests the customers to provide guarantee or security if necessary. The Company  regularly  accesses  the  collectability  of  accounts  receivable  and  recognizes allowance  for  accounts  receivable.  The  impairment  losses  are  always  within management's expectation.\n\nIn  monitoring  customer  credit  risk,  customers  are  grouped  according  to  their  credit characteristics,  including  customer  profile,  operating  and  financial  status,  payment records and the degree of cooperation. Customers that are graded as ' high risk'  are placed on a restricted customer list and monitored by the finance department more strictly, and the transactions are made on a more cautious way.",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC.\n\n## Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\nThe Company set the allowance for bad debt account to reflect the estimated losses for trade and other receivables. The allowance for bad debt account consists of specific losses relating to individually significant exposure and the unrecognized losses arising from similar assets groups. The allowance for bad debt account is based on historical collection record of similar financial assets.\n\n## 2) Investment\n\nThe  credit  risk  exposure  in  the  bank  deposits,  fixed  income  investments  and  other financial instruments are measured and monitored by the Company's finance department. Since the Company's transaction counterparties and contractually obligated counterparties  are  banks,  financial  institutes  and  corporate  organizations  with  good credits, there are no compliance issues, and therefore no significant credit risk.  The finance department evaluates the counterparty's credit condition when investing in bond investment without an active market, and does not expect to have any significant credit risk.\n\n## 3) Guarantees\n\nThe Company could only provide financial guarantees to subsidiaries under its policy. Please refer to note (13)(a) for the financial guarantees provided to subsidiaries by the Company as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## (iv) Liquidity risk\n\nThe Company manages sufficient cash and cash equivalents so as to cope with its operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Company's management supervises the banking facilities and ensures in compliance with the terms of the loan agreements.\n\nThe loans and borrowings from the bank and issued corporate bonds form an important source of liquidity for the Company.  Please refer to note (6)(k) and (6)(m) for unused credit lines as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## (v) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Company' s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n\nThe  Company buys and sells derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. Generally, the Company seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.\n\n## 1) Currency risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  respective  functional  currencies  of  the Company's entities, primarily the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) and US Dollars (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY).  The currencies used in these transactions are denominated in NTD, USD, and CNY.",

The Company also hedges trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.  The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.\n\nThe  Company designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. Most of these contracts have a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. The forward elements of forward exchange contracts are excluded from designation as the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. The Company's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Company assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\n## 2) Interest rate risk\n\nThe  Company borrows funds on fixed and variable interest rates, which has a risk exposure to changes in fair value and cash flow. Therefore, the Company manages the interest rates risk by maintaining an adequate combination of fixed and variable interest rates.\n\n## 3) Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from investments in foreign listed equity securities.\n\n## (x) Capital management\n\nThe Company maintain the capital based on the current operating characteristics of the industry, future development, and changes in external environment, to assure there is financial resource and operating plan to support working capital, capital expenditures, research & development expense, debt redemption and dividend payment and so on. The management decides the optimized capital by using appropriate debt-to-equity ratio, interest-bearing liabilities-to-equity ratio or other financial ratios. To maintain a strong capital base, the Company enhances the return on equity by optimizing debt-to-equity ratio.
